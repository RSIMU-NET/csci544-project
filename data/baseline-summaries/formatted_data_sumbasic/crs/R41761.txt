the united states enjoys a strong legacy of defense cooperation with turkey , both bilaterally and in the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) , dating from the onset of the cold war .

for both countries , mutual cooperation has major implications for national security priorities in turkey's surrounding region — particularly the greater middle east .

a more independent turkish foreign policy course — reflected in recent international events involving iran , israel , and other countries — has raised concerns among some members of congress .

this , coupled with a decline of the military's influence in turkish society , may affect prospects and present challenges for bilateral and nato defense cooperation , while also generating ongoing debate over which country needs the other more to pursue and achieve its national security objectives .

a challenge for u.s. officials — particularly in the white house , the defense department ( dod ; both civilian and military branches ) , and the state department — is to adjust future modes of bilateral interaction with turkey on defense matters to account for greater fluidity within the internal turkish civil - military power structure .

determining proper interlocutors for both countries on different but interrelated questions of ( 1 ) grand strategy ( which involves political objectives beyond pure military matters ) , ( 2 ) military strategy , and ( 3 ) tactical and operational objectives could lead to an approach that is more multidimensional than the well - established pattern some observers see in which the state department and other u.s. officials rely on the "pentagon to wield its influence. .

areas of potential interest or concern for congress , as well as other u.s. policymakers , include the following: overall defense relationship : reconciling regional perceptions of growing turkish influence and declining u.s. influence with persisting turkish interest in defense cooperation to address immediate security and deterrence needs .

nato / missile defense : turkey's role in nato , both in ( 1 ) defining the scope of alliance action and objectives in possible cases of intervention , such as libya ; and ( 2 ) regarding aspects of alliance - wide defense , such as an approved missile defense system that could feature a radar station and other elements in turkey to counter threats from iran and elsewhere .

iraq and afghanistan : cooperating with turkey to achieve stability and a reduced threat of terrorism from iraq and afghanistan through ( 1 ) joint counterterrorism efforts , ( 2 ) use of turkish bases and territory for cargo transport , ( 3 ) possible arms sales , and ( 4 ) direct involvement of turkish non - combat troops ( in afghanistan ) and trainers .

israel : addressing implications of increasingly distant turkey - israel relations on u.s. - turkey defense cooperation .

armenian genocide resolution : continuing defense cooperation with turkey in light of a possible adverse turkish reaction to a potential u.s. congressional resolution or presidential statement characterizing world war i - era actions of the ottoman empire against armenians as genocide .

expectations regarding the likely nature and extent of a possible adverse turkish reaction vary .

future prospects for various modes of defense cooperation : these include ( 1 ) joint exercises and missions ; ( 2 ) stationing of u.s. / nato personnel and arms ( including a reported nuclear weapons arsenal ) in turkey ; ( 3 ) forms of defense - related u.s. aid , including international military education and training ; and ( 4 ) defense industrial cooperation .

u.s. - turkey defense cooperation continues apace with respect to promoting stability and countering terrorism in iraq and afghanistan .

a u.s. defense presence in turkey also continues — both through nato and under the terms of a 1980 defense and economic cooperation agreement ( deca ) — as do joint defense consultations , training , and military exercises .

finally , turkey continues to seek advanced military equipment from the u.s. government and private sector ( i.e. , fighter aircraft , drone aircraft , helicopters , and missile defense systems ) , and its defense industry participates in joint ventures with the united states ( eg , on the f - 35 joint strike fighter ) .

however , turkey's growing defense industry and its increased willingness to engage in arms import - export transactions or joint military exercises with non - nato countries , such as china , russia , syria , pakistan , and south korea , indicate turkey's interest in diversifying its defense relationships and decreasing its dependence on the united states , consistent with the more independent foreign policy the akp government is pursuing .

these and additional areas of cooperation are discussed below .

congress and other u.s. policymakers may choose from a range of possible approaches to action on and oversight of u.s. defense cooperation with turkey .

in considering options , members of congress could engage in formal and informal oversight and information - gathering through committee hearings and consultations with key actors within the executive branch , the turkish government and defense establishment , and non - governmental and international organizations , including the nato parliamentary assembly .

four possible approaches are described below , in no particular order of priority .

status quo approach : would not focus significantly on recent developments , but rather emphasize and express confidence that existing nato and bilateral relationships — with their long legacies — can address mutual security challenges , even in an evolving regional and global context .

those favoring this approach might argue that recent changes within and outside of turkey should not change the overall parameters of the alliance .

these advocates might present a historical view arguing that u.s. - turkey defense relations , even during the cold war , have experienced ups and downs , but that each side ultimately concludes that it needs the other and therefore a permanent rupture is unlikely in the future .

this approach would not advocate conditioning u.s. cooperation with turkey on specific actions or relations with third - party countries .

it would not acknowledge either a need to revisit institutional structures or decision - making processes , or the possibility that turkish foreign policy stances in opposition to the united states could lead to a more mature and productive bilateral relationship in the long run .

critics of a status quo approach , however , could argue that recent challenges to the u.s. - turkey alliance are fundamentally different than past ones , and that a static view of the bilateral and nato alliances in light of regional and global changes risks ceding initiative to other actors and leaving the united states unprepared for the potential consequences .

omer taspinar , longtime analyst of u.s. - turkey relations at the brookings institution , wrote in early 2011 of the possible risks if u.s. officials and analysts pay insufficient attention to changes in the alliance's dynamics: as france did under charles de gaulle in the 1960s , turkey may opt for its own … "realpolitik" with countries such as china , india , and russia .

it could even contemplate leaving , as france under de gaulle did , the military structure of nato , while maintaining its political membership in the organization .

accommodative approach: accord high priority to the u.s. - turkey alliance and revise expectations for it by accommodating turkey's expressions of its national interests — and u.s. perceptions of these interests — given recent developments within turkey , the region , and globally .

by maintaining that the alliance is based broadly on shared values and interests such as long - term regional stability , rather than on any particular issue , congress might acknowledge its dedication to cooperation even in the event turkey opposes u.s. policies in certain cases .

responsiveness to turkish requests for arms to counter the pkk , turkish conditions on hosting missile defense system elements , and turkish desires to have a greater role in multilateral institutional structures and decision - making processes that address regional order would be possible despite ongoing turkish disputes with israel and armenia , and despite turkish relations with actors such as iran , china , syria , and hamas .

under this approach congress could still voice criticism of turkey on issues affecting u.s. interests , but might generally avoid characterizing any such issue as a litmus test for the alliance .

those supporting this approach might argue that turkey is more likely to serve u.s. and nato interests as an "independent" and "credible" regional actor than as an actor perceived as following western dictates .

some analysts have argued that strong u.s. relations with democratically elected turkish leaders is the best ( or least - worst ) option for forwarding regional u.s. interests and countering iranian influence in places such as iraq , regardless of u.s. - turkey divergences on some issues .

a counterargument is that this approach would establish a bad precedent by ceding judgment to turkey to determine whether an action or policy that appears to run contrary to u.s. interests ( such as on iran or israel ) is justified , and that it also constitutes tacit u.s. acceptance and even de facto sponsorship of turkey's efforts to diversify its military contacts and import - export relationships with other countries , including china .

in the absence of specifically prescribed limits to toleration of turkish divergence from u.s. stances on key issues , this approach could be seen as an imprudent overcorrection .

linkage approach: link cooperation to some extent to turkey 's relations with certain third - party countries or non - state actors — including iran , israel , hamas , armenia , and china — or to turkish actions on issues of u.s. national security interest .

clear parameters for cooperation will arguably allow turkey to demonstrate the importance it attaches to cooperation with the united states , depending on how closely it aligns its actions with u.s. interests .

recent u.s. differences with turkey on the iranian nuclear issue and other issues may have been caused or exacerbated by mutual misperceptions .

however , avoiding miscommunication might be difficult in any event given multiple congressional views that potentially conflict with each other and with administration views on what parameters to set and how to set them .

on the other hand , this approach might lead turkey to adopt the view that third - party countries or priority issues are more important to the united states than its alliance with turkey .

firm congressional redlines or ultimatums could risk the relationship's future , particularly if turkey chooses to challenge them , while giving ground on them could endanger u.s. credibility .

case - by - case approach: use or combine any of the other three approaches on a case - by - case basis .

approach ( es ) to u.s. - turkey defense cooperation matters could hinge on a number of factors , including the following: u.s. - turkish agreement on how to address regional security challenges ; turkey's relations with key third - party countries and non - state actors , including iran , israel , hamas , armenia , china , cyprus , and greece ; turkey's perceived importance to u.s. interests given regional and global developments and trends , as well as possible alternate locations for military basing and transport corridors ; the level of u.s. trust in turkish leaders ( civilian and military ) and in internal turkish stability ; and the likelihood of influencing turkey to act in u.s. interests and of strengthening the overall bilateral and nato relationships .

using a case - by - case approach , however , risks that turkey and outside observers will characterize congressional action and oversight as inconsistent and unpredictable .

it may have the advantage , however , of being responsive to changing developments in a region of the world that is of critical importance to u.s. national security .

the decades - long u.s. - turkey defense relationship has passed through different phases during and after the cold war .

a confluence of developments over the past decade that include ( 1 ) the 2003 iraq war and its consequences for u.s. influence in the region and the world , ( 2 ) greater turkish engagement regionally and globally due to leadership from the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) and sustained economic growth , and ( 3 ) political change within turkey that has reduced the military's influence and changed the tenor of public debate has contributed to a strategic environment in which divergences between u.s. and turkish defense priorities and threat perceptions appear to many to carry greater implications than past divergences .

u.s. efforts to benefit from turkey's location between the west and middle east , both geographically and culturally / symbolically , may influence both u.s. and turkish perceptions of the mutual benefits and leverage of the relationship .

some officials and analysts believe that in at least some respects the united states needs turkey more than turkey needs the united states , given ( 1 ) increased turkish economic and military self - sufficiency , and ( 2 ) what they view as a relative decline of u.s. influence in the region and globally as other actors emerge — particularly those that have greater intimate knowledge of the region and more of an existential stake in its security .

others counter that claims of turkish leverage over the united states are exaggerated because turkey's influence with the united states ultimately depends on its ability to help deliver regional outcomes that serve u.s. interests ; the united states arguably can depend on other allies to deliver outcomes it desires ; and it is unclear whether any potential non - nato alliance could provide turkey with superior , equal , or comparable ( 1 ) security guarantees , ( 2 ) regional influence and geopolitical prestige , or ( 3 ) collaborative benefits on military matters such as procurement , interoperability , or training .

turkey may seek to use any leverage it has to take a more proactive role with its allies in shaping processes , outcomes , and institutional structures in response to changes it perceives in regional and international order .

these opportunities could increase in the wake of the political changes beginning in january 2011 that have affected the region , particularly arab countries traditionally allied to the united states such as egypt .

current u.s. - turkish defense cooperation , both bilaterally and within nato , reflects shared interests in maintaining regional stability , manifested clearly through counterterrorism cooperation against the pkk in northern iraq and turkish participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan .

concerns about stability also motivate turkey's agreement in principle to a nato ballistic missile defense ( bmd ) system that anticipates potential threats from iran .

however , turkey may not have yet decided whether it perceives hosting a proposed u.s. bmd radar under nato auspices as , on balance , more likely to cultivate stability , or as unduly provocative to neighboring countries .

turkish estimations of the u.s. epaa missile defense system's theoretical and practical capability to protect turkish territory and populations would likely factor into a decision .

mutual perceptions of the overall bilateral relationship — influenced by statements on turkey's policies and rhetoric vis - à - vis israel and iran and possible action related to a potential armenian genocide resolution by members of congress — may determine the extent of future u.s. - turkey defense cooperation .

the availability of turkish bases and territory for u.s. / nato deployments , operations , and supply lines is valuable and remains a possible point of contention and leverage , but the extent of its importance and of alternatives may be subject to further analysis .

the decline of the turkish military's societal influence could affect the conduct of relations that have traditionally been largely managed between dod and the turkish general staff .

it also could affect the identity of key interlocutors on both sides , with possible consequences for the predictability to each side of the other's messaging , negotiating , and decision - making patterns .

turkey's increasing diversification of defense contacts and potential procurement and industrial cooperation with non - nato countries buttresses some analysts' assertions that it seeks greater autonomy and may be trending toward the more neutral international stance it adopted during the years between the founding of its republic in the 1920s and the beginning of the cold war .

although issues in the past year involving turkey's stances on israel and iran have heightened the attention westerners are paying to turkey's strategic orientation , analysts such as edward erickson were discussing the issue as early as 2005: it is evident that the turks do not want to be sidelined by the us or the west when it comes to their own national security concerns .

neither do they want to be hamstrung by easily severed logistics .

clearly they want to be , and have been thinking about becoming , important players in regional politics , and their public national security policy says as much .

they have become involved at every opportunity in multi - national military interventions .

they have shown a willingness to defy the us .

they have industrial and procurement plans aimed at strategic autonomy .

yet , even given a more diversified and autonomous turkish military production and procurement system , turkey apparently covets various advanced military technologies — including fighter and drone aircraft , helicopters , and missile defense systems — for which the united states remains one of the only global suppliers .

for the foreseeable future , the united states may be uniquely qualified to supply a wide range of arms to turkey in light of turkish objectives for military capability and interoperability .

thus , despite changes to the u.s. - turkey defense relationship , and the current lack of annual foreign military financing funding , several factors indicate the importance for both countries of cooperating on a wide range issues that affect regional and global security .

without compromising its positions on core national security interests , congress might take one or more general approaches on u.s. - turkey defense cooperation ( see " possible u.s. policy approaches " above ) both to minimize the frequency and scope of disagreement on security and procurement issues , and prevent the occasional differences on issues that do occur from disrupting common efforts on others or from harming the overall bilateral relationship or the nato alliance .

appendix a .

historical overview cold war era u.s. - turkey defense cooperation began near the end of world war ii when turkey , having been neutral until february 1945 , declared war on germany and japan to become a founding member of the united nations .

when it became clear after the war that stalin's soviet union had designs on territory in eastern turkey and on privileged naval access through turkey's bosporus and dardanelles straits to the mediterranean , turkey welcomed the april 1946 arrival of the u.s. battleship u.s.s .

missouri in istanbul harbor .

president harry truman's subsequent pledge in march 1947 of economic ( marshall plan ) and military assistance to both turkey and greece solidified turkey's role as a western ally and geographic buffer against soviet influence .

after turkey's participation in united nations forces during the korean war gained it the reputation of a reliable and capable ally , turkey joined nato in 1952 .

in subsequent years , the united states and turkey signed military facilities and status of forces agreements , and the united states established more than 30 defense - related installations in turkey with approximately 5,000 u.s. personnel , increasing to approximately 25,000 at the high point in the 1960s .

in 1959 , the united states stationed 15 jupiter ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads in turkey .

these were removed as part of the u.s. - soviet deal that ended the 1962 cuban missile crisis , but were later replaced by tactical nuclear weapons , some of which reportedly remain in turkey ( see " bases and transport corridors " ) .

in addition , the united states provided turkey with more than $4.5 billion in military assistance from 1948 to 1975 — an average of approximately $160 million per year — to help it man , equip , train , and modernize its armed forces .

the u.s. - turkey defense relationship endured complications during the cold war .

cyprus was a major source of those troubles , particularly in the 1960s and 1970s .

a strongly - worded letter from president lyndon johnson to turkish prime minister ismet inonu may have helped prevent turkish intervention on the island in 1964 following the breakdown of greek - turkish power sharing , but it raised questions about how well the u.s. alliance served turkey's interests that intensified greatly when turkey sent troops using u.s. - supplied arms to intervene on behalf of the turkish cypriot minority in 1974 and congress responded with the 1975-1978 embargo on u.s. military grants and arms sales to turkey described in the main body of the report ( see " background " ) .

although the alliance revived in 1980 with a new defense and economic cooperation agreement ( deca ) in the wake of the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the iranian revolution , turkey emphasized that the u.s. military presence on turkish installations was under nato auspices .

u.s. military assistance was restored as well , reaching unprecedented levels in historical terms with an approximate annual average of $425 million in grants and $110 million in loans from 1987 to 1992 .

this facilitated a general upgrade of turkey's weapons systems .

post - 1980 u.s. military assistance to greece and turkey was provided at a 7-to - 10 ratio .

although turkey received the greater amount , it routinely complained that its size , share of nato's military burden , and relative importance to western interests justified an even greater proportional advantage over greece .

as the cold war was ending , turkey joined its nato allies and the warsaw pact countries , including the united states and the soviet union , in entering into the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe ( cfe treaty ) .

the cfe treaty sought to maintain peace and stability among former cold war adversaries by limiting types and levels of conventional forces , both europe - wide and in certain key regions ( which included turkey ) , and subjecting the parties to joint monitoring .

the treaty was signed in 1990 and entered into force in 1992 .

russia , however , unilaterally suspended its compliance in 2007 , partly due to lingering disagreements with other parties over its force posture in sensitive "flank zones" — including areas opposite the northeastern turkish border in georgia and in russia's north caucasian periphery .

post - cold war era: two iraq wars for the 1991 gulf war , turkey allowed the u.s. - led coalition to use its bases for air strikes on iraqi territory after closing a pipeline through which iraq had exported oil through turkish territory .

also , the amassing of troops by turkey on iraq's northern border helped the coalition's efforts by drawing significant iraqi troop strength away from the southern front in the gulf from which the invasion came .

nevertheless , the run - up to the war presaged future subjections of the military to strong civilian leadership when then - chief of the turkish general staff , general necip torumtay , resigned out of disagreement with then - president turgut ozal's decision to involve turkey in the war .

in the war's aftermath , u.s. and british military aircraft based at turkey's incirlik air base patrolled the no - fly zone established at the end of hostilities in the heavily kurdish - populated areas of northern iraq .

although the gulf war had reinforced turkey's geostrategic importance to the united states and nato , the end of the cold war appeared to congress to have removed the rationale for providing large amounts of grant aid to arm the turkish military .

foreign military financing ( fmf ) grants were phased into loan - only assistance in 1993 , and the loans were phased out after 1997 .

in the aftermath of the al qaeda terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , on u.s. territory , turkey gained new importance as a possible staging ground for u.s. - led military action in the region .

given that turkey had allowed the united states use of its air bases for limited military action in iraq since 1991 , and had subsequently participated with the united states in missions in somalia , bosnia - herzegovina , kosovo , and afghanistan , george w. bush administration officials believed they could obtain permission to station u.s. ground troops at turkey's border with iraq to open a second front in the 2003 iraq war .

after the newly elected government led by the islamic - leaning justice and development party ( akp ) secured promises of approximately $24 billion in u.s. aid and loan guarantees ( including $15 billion in immediate aid ) , it overcame its initial reservations to agree , albeit somewhat lukewarmly , to the u.s. plan .

however , the turkish parliament failed to muster the absolute majority ( based on the total amount of parliamentary votes possible ) required to approve the u.s. request in march 2003 ( even though "yes" votes outnumbered "no" votes 264-251 ) when nearly 100 akp members voted against the measure or abstained , possibly due to an unwillingness to endorse invading a fellow muslim country .

this surprise , which forced the bush administration into last - minute adjustments for a single front , led to serious u.s. displeasure with its turkish ally .

analysts have advanced several possible explanations for the turkish parliament's 2003 decision on iraq .

one is that the united states , in its request to stage a ground invasion from turkey , asked for more in 2003 than it did in 1991 , even though many believed that the u.s. argument for going to war against iraq was less merited , and the threat saddam hussein posed to turkey less severe .

another is that the benefits turkey received for its cooperation in the 1991 war were significantly fewer than expected , leading turkish lawmakers to reduce expectations in their cost - benefit analysis for 2003 .

many were skeptical that u.s. and other international aid ( particularly from gulf states ) turkey received for its support in 1991 — though substantial ( approximately $17 billion in arms and military and economic aid ) — had been worth the costs incurred in ( 1 ) reduced trade from the war and from international sanctions against iraq ( estimated at between $30 billion - $60 billion ) , ( 2 ) regional destabilization and refugee influxes , and ( 3 ) the emboldening of kurdish separatists ( especially the pkk ) to operate from greater safe haven in northern iraq .

turkey's hopes in 1990-1991 that its cooperation might decisively cement its economic , political , and security integration with europe had been frustrated by nato's tepid response ( reprised during the run - up to the 2003 war ) in committing in advance of the war to the collective defense of turkey under article 5 in the event of an iraqi attack , as well as by continued uncertainty over turkey's european union ( eu ) membership prospects .

in addition , strides turkey had made since the 1991 war to increase its economic and military self - sufficiency and to reduce threats on its borders contributed to perceptions that it was less dependent on u.s. assistance .

a 2007 turkish studies article said , in the end , it appears that the turks' appraisal of the strength of their position vis - à - vis the united states was accurate .

despite turkey's refusal to facilitate the invasion , the united states went to significant lengths to make sure turkey's vital interests were looked after .

not only did the united states not change its position on kurdish independence and continued to push for a democratic , centralized regime in iraq , but the united states even … reinstated turkey as a recipient of regular financial aid .

the reason for this american generosity is that in the end , while very disappointed about the way relations had soured , us officials realized that they did not want to cause turkish decisionmakers to reconsider their fundamental alignment .

nevertheless , as mentioned in the main body of the report ( see " background " ) the turkish parliament's 2003 decision on iraq showed the united states that in its defense relationship with turkey , it could no longer rely solely on past legacies of cooperation and its close ties with the turkish military .

ultimately , turkey allowed u.s. overflights into iraq , and after the united states coalition had occupied iraq and begun stability , counterinsurgency , and reconstruction operations , turkey permitted the united states use of turkish bases and border crossings for troop rotations and transport of non - lethal cargo to and from iraq .

the resumption of pkk attacks in turkey following the u.s. - led invasion in 2003 , however , has made countering terrorism from the pkk's northern iraqi safe havens a core turkish security concern that has led to further u.s. - turkey tensions .

since late 2007 , turkey has received direct u.s. cooperation in countering the pkk , and it reportedly seeks to acquire more advanced equipment to increase its own counterterrorism capabilities .

as mentioned above , the united states resumed fmf grant assistance to turkey after september 11 , 2001 , averaging $27 million per year from 2002 to 2007 .

this assistance was completely phased out once more in fy2010 , leaving international military education and training ( imet ) , international narcotics control and law enforcement ( incle ) , and nonproliferation , antiterrorism , demining , and related programs ( nadr ) funds as the primary sources of annual u.s. military and security assistance to turkey .

dod holds approximately $75 million of unobligated fmf funds appropriated for turkey in prior years in reserve for potential future use ( see " military and security assistance " ) .

appendix b. turkish procurement and defense industry policy turkey and the united states have a history of defense industry cooperation .

traditionally , many u.s. aircraft turkey has purchased have been assembled in turkey by tusas aerospace industries , which was partially owned by u.s. - based companies lockheed martin and general electric international .

this helped turkey develop an indigenous defense industry that is becoming a major supplier in its surrounding region .

for example , turkey has since assembled 46 f - 16s for egypt and upgraded dozens more for jordan .

in 2005 , state - owned turkish aircraft industries bought out the remaining tusas shares and formed turkish aerospace industries ( tai ) through a merger , signifying an increasing emphasis by the state on boosting its indigenous defense production capacity .

other major turkish defense firms include ( 1 ) aselsan , which specializes in electronics and software ; ( 2 ) roketsan , which specializes in missile technology ; and ( 3 ) otokar , which specializes in land - based vehicles .

as noted in figure 2 , turkey's procurement objectives called for 50% indigenous defense production by the end of 2010 , and foreign trade minister zefer caglayan claimed in august 2010 that indigenous production reached 46% in 2009 .

the strategic plan also calls for at least a 50% return in direct or indirect offsets on procurement agreements with a value of at least $10 million .

emphasis on procurement from countries and firms that provide offsets , allow co - production , and issue export licenses at the bidding stage can be at odds with u.s. arms export laws and practices , particularly when sensitive technology is involved , and has made it more difficult for u.s. firms to obtain contracts .

thus , as mentioned in " arms sales and industrial cooperation ," turkey looks to other suppliers that may not be as technologically advanced or reliable , but that turkey perceives as being more flexible in negotiations and in sharing expertise , and therefore more helpful in contributing to turkey's long - term goal of industrial self - reliance .

the following are some examples of recent or pending turkish defense procurement tenders: attack helicopters .

in 2007 , turkey chose to purchase 50 "t129" variants of the a129 mangusta attack and tactical reconnaissance ( atak ) helicopter ( with an option for another 41 ) for $2.7 billion .

although italy's agustawestland is the main technology source , tai is designated as the primary contractor to cultivate the image of turkish self - reliance .

a prominent turkish procurement official had voiced a preference for off - the - shelf u.s. apache or cobra helicopters , and u.s. officials claimed that the bidding process unfairly excluded u.s. firms .

when the test aircraft crashed in 2010 , likely pushing delivery beyond the planned 2013 date , turkey sought to acquire u.s. bell ah - 1w supercobras as a stopgap measure .

when the united states told turkey it was unable to meet turkey's timeline for the stopgap delivery , turkey purchased nine mangustas from agustawestland for $209 million , with delivery slated for 2012 after tai assembles the exported kits .

u.s. firms will provide the helicopter engines in any case .

utility helicopters .

u.s. firm sikorsky aircraft is competing with agustawestland to sell turkey 109 utility helicopters for approximately $4 billion , with the possibility of selling nearly 200 more in the future .

as is the case regarding turkey's attack helicopter deal with agustawestland , tai would be listed as the prime contractor and would co - produce the utility helicopters , which would replace turkey's aging fleet dominated by u.s. - exported black hawks and hueys .

both sikorsky ( which is offering a turkish version of its s - 70 black hawk international ) and agustawestland ( offering a turkish version of its a149 ) have offered several extras to make their offers more attractive , focusing on offsets and opportunities for turkish export production .

turkey's defense industry executive committee may make a decision on the tender as early as march 2011 .

cargo transport aircraft .

turkey joined a consortium with six european nato allies in 2001 for the airbus a400m transport plane , and plans to purchase 10 .

the program has been delayed and experienced cost overruns , but the consortium reportedly signed a final contract in april 2011 .

in the meantime , saudi arabia has agreed to sell turkey six older model u.s. - origin c - 130s to meet turkey's interim needs , pending congressional notification .

battle tanks .

in july 2008 , south korea's hyundai rotem signed a $400 million contract with turkish company otokar to develop and produce up to 250 main battle tanks .

under the terms of the deal , hyundai rotem will supply more than 50% of the technology to develop the tanks and will work alongside otokar on the design and development of four prototypes .

anti - tank missile systems .

russia's rosoboronexport agreed to deliver about 800 kornet - e medium - range anti - tank missile systems to turkey for $100 million as a stopgap measure while turkish firm roketsan continues to develop an indigenous medium - range anti - tank missile system .

submarines .

turkey will acquire six type 214 submarines ( to replace some of its 1970s - era atilay - class type 209 submarines ) from germany's howaldtswerke - deutsche werft ( hdw , turkey's longtime submarine supplier ) and its united kingdom - based commercial partner marineforce international ( mfi ) under a $3.96 billion contract signed in july 2009 , with delivery expected between 2015 and 2020 .

turkish minister of national defense vecdi gonul said in july 2008 that turkish industrial participation is expected to reach about 80% of the contract , with approximately 20 systems and subsystems produced and integrated locally .

aspirations for indigenous turkish defense industrial capabilities extend to large drone aircraft ( turkey already produces small drones for deployment ) and missile defense systems , but current turkish plans indicate that in the near term , turkey seeks to acquire this equipment and possibly share in its assembly in the hopes that it may receive technology and develop a knowledge base and infrastructure that shortens the timeline for indigenous design and production .

as it begins to meet its own security demands and develops higher quantities of more advanced equipment , external demand for turkish arms has led to increased exports .

according to jane's world defence industry , to date , turkish industries have exported only eight platforms: among these are missiles , rocket launchers , radios , tracked and wheeled vehicles , electronic systems , pilot simulators and coastguard craft .

the electronic systems and pilot simulators alone represent "big ticket" items that can generate the necessary income for turkey's indigenous industries to develop not only the production base but also the research and development ( r&d ) institutions necessary for large - scale expansion .

the ssm [defense procurement undersecretariat] has highlighted the netherlands , pakistan , the united arab emirates , south korea , algeria and bahrain as recent destinations for turkish defence materiel .

in addition , in june 2008 , turkey's foreign trade minister , kursad tuzmen , highlighted the asia pacific region as a potential target region for defence sales .

nevertheless , according to the stockholm international peace research institute , in 2009 turkey was the world's 10 th largest arms importer and only its 26 th largest exporter .

as noted in figure 2 , a promotional office affiliated with turkey's procurement agency , the ssm , opened near washington , dc , in 2010 , and similar offices are planned to open soon in europe ( belgium ) , the persian gulf ( qatar ) , and the caucasus and central asia ( either azerbaijan or turkmenistan ) .
