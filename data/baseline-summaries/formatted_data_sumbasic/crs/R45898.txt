the united states and the people's republic of china ( prc or china ) are involved in a prolonged stand - off over trade , and in competition that is spilling from political and military areas into a growing number of other spheres , including technology , finance , and education , severely straining ties on the 40 th anniversary of the two countries' establishment of diplomatic relations .

the two countries lead the world in the size of their economies , their defense budgets , and their global greenhouse gas emissions .

both countries are permanent members of the united nations ( u.n. ) security council .

in 2018 , they were each other's largest trading partners .

trump administration strategy documents have set the tone for u.s. policy toward china .

the december 2017 national security strategy ( nss ) describes both china and russia as seeking to "challenge american power , influence , and interests , attempting to erode american security and prosperity. .

an unclassified summary of the january 2018 u.s. national defense strategy describes china as a "strategic competitor" and charges that it is pursuing a military modernization program that "seeks indo - pacific regional hegemony in the near - term and displacement of the united states to achieve global preeminence in the future. .

the department of defense's ( dod's ) june 2019 indo - pacific strategy report identifies "the primary concern for u.s. national security" as "inter - state strategic competition , defined by geopolitical rivalry between free and repressive world order visions. .

the trump administration has leveled its strongest criticism at china's economic practices .

in a major october 4 , 2018 , address on china policy , vice president mike pence charged that china has used "an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade" to build its manufacturing base , "at the expense of its competitorsâespecially the united states of america. .

in their public statements on the united states , china's top leaders have generally refrained from direct criticism .

in july 2019 , prc vice president wang qishan stated that "profound shifts are taking place in the relations between major countries," noting "mounting protectionism and populist ideologies" and "intensifying geopolitical rivalry and regional turbulence. .

prc vice foreign minister le yucheng , speaking at the same forum , addressed u.s. - china relations directly .

the bilateral relationship , le asserted , is "now going through the most complex and sensitive period since diplomatic relations were formalized four decades ago. .

le called for "a china - us relationship based on coordination , cooperation and stability," and pushed back at the idea that china is responsible for u.s .

"challenges. .

the wars in afghanistan and iraq "sapped [u.s.] strategic strength," le asserted , and the global financial crisis "exposed the deep - seated imbalances in the u.s. economy and society. .

the united states should not make china "a scapegoat," le argued , for "[p]roblems such as economic disparity , widening wealth gap and aging infrastructure. .

u.s. - china tensions predated the trump administration .

frictions over such issues as taiwan , trade , and china's human rights record have been long - standing , as have been u.s. concerns about the intentions behind china's ambitious military modernization efforts .

united states trade representative ( ustr ) reports to congress going back to the last years of the george w. bush administration document mounting u.s. frustrations with china's failure to implement market - opening commitments it made when it acceded to the world trade organization ( wto ) in december 2001 .

previous administrations concluded , however , that a modus vivendi with china was necessary for a broad array of u.s. policy objectives in the world , and they thus sought to balance competition and cooperation in the u.s. - china relationship .

during the trump administration , competition has dominated the relationship and areas of cooperation have shrunk .

to pressure china to change its economic practices , the united states has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of u.s. imports from china , with almost all imports from china scheduled to be subject to additional tariffs by december 15 , 2019 .

u.s. tariffs and china's retaliatory tariffs have reordered global supply chains and hit u.s. farmers and manufacturers particularly hard .

twelve rounds of negotiations have not resolved the dispute .

on august 5 , 2019 , the u.s. treasury department labeled china a currency manipulator for the first time in a quarter century .

the administration has placed restrictions on the ability of u.s. firms to supply prc telecommunications giant huawei .

the united states has also sought to warn other nations away from business dealings with huawei and from cooperation with china on infrastructure projects under the framework of china's belt and road initiative ( bri ) .

feeding a persistent narrative that the administration seeks to "decouple" the u.s. and chinese economies , on august 23 , 2019 , president trump wrote on twitter , "our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china , including bringing your companies home and making your products in the usa. .

as his authority for such an order , the president cited the international emergency economic powers act ( p.l .

95-223 ) , though he said on august 25 , 2019 , that he had "no plan right now" to trigger the law .

many analysts ascribe the rising friction in the relationship today not only to the arguably more confrontational inclinations of the trump administration , but also to more assertive behavior by china under president xi jinping .

xi assumed the top posts in the communist party of china in november 2012 and added the state presidency in march 2013 .

later in 2013 , china began building military outposts in the south china sea and xi launched bri , an ambitious effort to boost economic connectivityâand china's influenceâacross the globe .

in 2015 , china began enacting a suite of national security legislation that shrank the space for independent thought and civil society , subjected ordinary citizens to stepped - up surveillance , and imposed onerous conditions on foreign firms operating in china .

the same year , china launched its "made in china 2025" plan , seeking to reduce china's reliance on foreign technology and directing the considerable resources of the state toward supporting the development of "national champion" chinese firms in 10 strategic industries .

in 2017 , at the end of his first five - year term in his party posts , xi tasked china's military with turning itself into a "world - class" force by mid - century .

that year , his government also began forcing more than 1 million of his turkic muslim fellow citizens in the northwest region of xinjiang into reeducation camps .

in march 2018 , china's communist party - controlled legislature amended the state constitution to remove presidential term - limits , opening the way for xi to stay in office indefinitely .

increasingly , the united states and china appear to be seeking to draw other countries into competing campsâthose who agree to sign ( often vague ) bri cooperation agreements with china ( some 125 countries as of april 2019 , by china's count ) , and those who , at the u.s. government's behest , do not ; those who do business with huawei , and those who , similarly at the u.s. government's behest , do not ; those who publicly censure china for its actions in xinjiang , and those who offer support .

u.s. allies are sometimes in china's "camp. .

china represents "a new kind of challenge," secretary of state michael r. pompeo has suggested , because , "it's an authoritarian regime that's integrated economically into the west in ways the soviet union never was. .

important areas of remaining u.s. - china cooperation include maintaining pressure on north korea to curb its nuclear weapons and missile programs ; supporting the afghanistan peace process ; managing international public health challenges , from tuberculosis to influenza ; and stemming the flow into the united states of china - produced fentanyl , a class of deadly synthetic opioids .

many of the trump administration's critics share the administration's concerns about prc policies and actions , but disagree with the administration's framing of the relationship and with specific administration policies .

signatories to an open letter on china addressed to the president and members of congress and published in the washington post on july 3 , 2019 , acknowledge "troubling behavior" by china .

they argue , nonetheless , that china is not "an economic enemy or an existential national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere ; nor is china a monolith , or the views of its leaders set in stone. .

they warn , "if the u.s. presses its allies to treat china as an economic and political enemy , it will weaken its relations with those allies and could end up isolating itself rather than beijing. .

former obama administration officials kurt m. campbell and jake sullivan argue that , "the basic mistake of engagement was to assume that it could bring about fundamental changes to china's political system , economy , and foreign policy. .

they warn that , "washington risks making a similar mistake today , by assuming that competition can succeed in transforming china where engagement failedâthis time forcing capitulation or even collapse. .

campbell and sullivan call for "a steady state of clear - eyed coexistence on terms favorable to u.s. interests and values," with elements of competition and cooperation in four domains: military , economic , political , and global governance .

peter varghese , a former senior diplomat for australia , a u.s. ally , asserts that , "it would be a mistake for the us to cling to primacy by thwarting china .

those of us who value us leadership want the us to retain it by lifting its game , not spoiling china's. .

many analysts fault the trump administration for giving up leverage against china by withdrawing from international agreements and institutions , by allegedly paying insufficient attention to maintaining strong relationships with allies , and by engaging in inconsistent messaging around trade , human rights , and other issues .

in january 2017 , the administration notified the 11 other signatories to the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) , a proposed free trade agreement ( fta ) of asia - pacific countries ( not including china ) , that it would not be ratifying the agreement .

in june 2018 , the administration announced its withdrawal from the u.n. human rights council .

signatories of another high - profile open letter addressed to the president urge him , however , to "stay the course on your path of countering communist china. .

the letter states that supporters of engagement with china told american policymakers "that the prc would become a 'responsible stakeholder' once a sufficient level of economic modernization was achieved. .

the letter argues , "this did not happen and cannot so long as the ccp [chinese communist party] rules china. .

the letter assures the president , "we welcome the measures you have taken to confront xi's government and selectively to decouple the u.s. economy from china's insidious efforts to weaken it. .

the communist party of china ( cpc ) established the prc 70 years ago , on october 1 , 1949 , after winning a civil war against the nationalist ( also known as kuomintang or kmt ) forces of the republic of china ( roc ) led by chiang kai - shek .

today , china is the world's most populous nation ( with a population of 1.39 billion ) , the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases ( responsible for approximately 30% of global energy - related carbon dioxide emissions in 2016 ) , the world's second - largest economic power ( in nominal terms , with a gross domestic product or gdp of $13.6 trillion ) , and the only communist party - led state in the g - 20 grouping of major economies .

with the united states , france , russia , and the united kingdom , china is also one of five permanent members of the u.n. security council .

after the communist party took power in china in 1949 , the united states continued to recognize chiang kai - shek's roc government on taiwan as the legitimate government of all china .

a year later , the united states and china found themselves on opposite sides of the korean war , a conflict that killed 36,547 u.s. military personnel and at least 180,000 chinese military personnel .

china's name for the conflict is the "war to resist u.s .

aggression and aid korea. .

early in the conflict , the united states sent its seventh fleet to the taiwan strait "to prevent the korean conflict from spreading south," effectively preventing communist forces from realizing their goal of finishing the chinese civil war by wresting control of taiwan from chiang's forces .

in 1971 , changing cold war dynamics , including the sino - soviet split , led the nixon administration to undertake a profound shift in u.s. policy .

then - secretary of state henry kissinger made a secret visit to china in july 1971 .

in october of the same year , the united states supported u.n. general assembly resolution 2758 , recognizing the prc's representatives as "the only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations," and expelling "the representatives of chiang kai - shek. .

president richard nixon formally ended nearly a quarter of a century of estrangement between the united states and the prc with his historic visit to china in february 1972 .

on january 1 , 1979 , president jimmy carter and china's deng xiaoping presided over the establishment of diplomatic relations between their two nations .

the joint communiquã© they signed , one of three that china considers to lay the foundation for the u.s. - china relationship , states that the united states "acknowledges the chinese position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china. .

it also states that "the people of the united states will maintain cultural , commercial , and other unofficial relations with the people of taiwan. .

in april 1979 , carter signed the taiwan relations act ( p.l .

96-8 , u.s.c .

3301 et seq .

 ) , providing a legal basis for the unofficial u.s. relationship with taiwan and committing the united states to sell defensive arms to taiwan .

the same year , deng launched a bold program of "reforming and opening" to the outside world that would transform china from a backward , isolated country into the economic powerhouse , emerging military power , and shaper of global institutions that it is today .

through the 1970s and 1980s , the overriding strategic rationale for the u.s. - china relationship was counterbalancing a shared enemy , the soviet union .

with the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , u.s. and chinese leaders cast about for a new rationale for their relationship .

president bill clinton and china's then - leader jiang zemin both came to see benefits in expanding bilateral economic ties , including by working together to bring china into the wto .

on october 10 , 2000 , clinton signed into law p.l .

106-286 , granting china permanent normal trade relations and paving the way for china to join the wto , which it did in december 2001 .

in 2018 , the trump administration argued that "the united states erred in supporting china's entry into the wto on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing china's embrace of an open , market - oriented trade regime. .

a former george w. bush administration official suggests that "identifying a preferable alternative , even with the benefit of hindsight , is surpassingly difficult. .

after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the george w. bush administration settled on counterterrorism cooperation as a new strategic rationale for the u.s. - china relationship , but china complicated that rationale when it persuaded the united states to apply a terrorist label to separatist ethnic uyghurs from its northwest xinjiang region .

during the obama administration , even as u.s. - china friction mounted over economic issues , cyber espionage , human rights , and the south china sea , the two sides embraced as a strategic rationale for their relationship the need for their cooperation to address some of the world's most pressing challenges , including weak global economic growth , climate change , and nuclear proliferation .

observers broadly credited u.s. - china cooperation for contributing to the conclusion of the july 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) nuclear deal with iran and the december 2015 paris agreement under the u.n .

framework convention on climate change .

over the past four decades , the u.s. - china relationship has faced some high - profile tests: in june 1989 , a decade after normalization of u.s. - china relations , china's leaders ordered the people's liberation army ( pla ) to clear beijing's tiananmen square of peaceful protestors , killing hundreds , or more .

in response , the united states imposed sanctions on china , some of which remain in place today .

in 1995-1996 , a u.s. decision to allow taiwan president lee teng - hui to make a private visit to the united states and deliver a speech at his alma mater , cornell university , led to what became known as the third taiwan strait crisis .

china expressed its anger at the visit by conducting a series of missile exercises around taiwan , prompting the clinton administration to dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area .

in may 1999 , two decades after normalization of u.s. - china relations , a u.s. air force b - 2 bomber involved in north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) operations over yugoslavia mistakenly dropped five bombs on the chinese embassy in belgrade , killing three chinese journalists and injuring 20 embassy personnel .

the event set off anti - u.s. demonstrations in china , during which protestors attacked u.s. diplomatic facilities .

in april 2001 , a pla naval j - 8 fighter plane collided with a u.s. navy ep - 3 reconnaissance plane over the south china sea , killing the chinese pilot .

the u.s. crew made an emergency landing on china's hainan island , where chinese authorities detained them for 11 days .

negotiations for return of the u.s. plane took much longer .

in february 2012 , a chongqing municipality vice mayor sought refuge in the u.s. consulate in the western china city of chengdu , where he is believed to have shared explosive information about wrongdoing by his then - boss , an ambitious politburo member .

thirty - six hours later , u.s. officials handed the vice mayor over to officials from beijing .

the politburo member , bo xilai , soon fell from grace in one of the most spectacular political scandals in prc history .

in april 2012 , after chinese legal advocate chen guangcheng , who is blind , escaped house arrest in china's shandong province , the u.s. embassy in china rescued him from the streets of beijing and brought him into the u.s. embassy compound , where he stayed for six days .

high - stakes negotiations between u.s. and prc diplomats led to chen moving first to a beijing hospital , and then , in may 2012 , to the united states .

in the 116 th congress , more than 150 bills and resolutions have been introduced with provisions related to china .

for details , see table 8 below .

a major vehicle for legislation related to china is the annual national defense authorization act .

as of early august 2019 , the national defense authorization act for fy2020 is engrossed in the house of representatives and the senate ( h.r .

2500 and s. 1790 ) .

table 9 , table 10 , table 11 , and table 12 identify provisions in the two bills that explicitly reference china , as well as several provisions potentially related or relevant to china .
