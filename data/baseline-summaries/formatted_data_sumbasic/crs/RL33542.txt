broadband or high - speed internet access is provided by a series of technologies that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than internet access over traditional telephone lines .

currently , a number of telecommunications companies are developing , installing , and marketing specific technologies and services to provide broadband access to the home .

meanwhile , the federal government — through congress and the federal communications commission ( fcc ) — is seeking to ensure fair competition among the players so that broadband will be available and affordable in a timely manner to all americans who want it .

broadband is being increasingly viewed as a vital public infrastructure , significant to the nation's ( and to individual regional , state , and local ) economic growth and vitality .

broadband access , along with the content and services it enables , has the potential to transform the internet — both what it offers and how it is used .

for example , a two - way high speed connection could be used for interactive applications such as online classrooms , showrooms , or health clinics , where teacher and student ( or customer and salesperson , doctor and patient ) can see and hear each other through their computers .

an "always on" connection could be used to monitor home security , home automation , or even patient health remotely through the web .

the high speed and high volume that broadband offers could also be used for bundled service where , for example , cable television , video on demand , voice , data , and other services are all offered over a single line .

in truth , it is possible that many of the applications that will best exploit the technological capabilities of broadband , while also capturing the imagination of consumers , have yet to be developed .

there are multiple transmission media or technologies that can be used to provide broadband access .

these include cable modem , an enhanced telephone service called digital subscriber line ( dsl ) , satellite technology , fiber , mobile or fixed wireless technologies , and others .

cable and dsl are currently the most widely used technologies for providing broadband access .

both require the modification of an existing physical infrastructure that is already connected to the home ( i.e. , cable television and telephone lines ) .

each technology has its respective advantages and disadvantages , and competes with each other based on performance , price , quality of service , geography , user friendliness , and other factors .

the following sections summarize cable , dsl , and other broadband technologies .

according to the latest fcc data on the deployment of high - speed internet connections ( released march 2008 ) , as of june 30 , 2007 , there were 100.9 million high speed lines connecting homes and businesses to the internet in the united states , a growth rate of 22% during the first half of 2007 .

of the 100.9 million high speed lines reported by the fcc , 65.9 million serve residential users .

while the broadband adoption rate stands at roughly 58% of u.s. households , broadband availability is much higher .

as of june 30 , 2007 , the fcc found at least one high - speed subscriber in 99% of all zip codes in the united states .

the fcc estimates that "roughly 20 percent of consumers with access to advanced telecommunications capability do subscribe to such services. .

according to the fcc , possible reasons for the gap between broadband availability and subscribership include the lack of computers in some homes , price of broadband service , lack of content , and the availability of broadband at work .

according to the international telecommunications union , the u.s. ranks 24 th worldwide in broadband penetration ( subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2007 ) .

data from the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) found the u.s. ranking 15 th among oecd nations in broadband access per 100 inhabitants as of december 2007 .

by contrast , in 2001 an oecd study found the u.s. ranking 4 th in broadband subscribership per 100 inhabitants ( after korea , sweden , and canada ) .

while many argue that the u.s. declining performance in international broadband rankings is a cause for concern , others — including the administration — maintain that the oecd and itu data undercount u.s. broadband deployment , and that cross - country broadband deployment comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and inherently problematic .

finally , an issue related to international broadband rankings is the extent to which broadband speeds and prices differ between the u.s. and the rest of the world .

while the number of new broadband subscribers continues to grow , the rate of broadband deployment in urban and high income areas appears to be outpacing deployment in rural and low - income areas .

according to the latest fcc data on the deployment of high - speed internet connections ( released march 2008 ) , high - speed subscribers were reported in 99% of the most densely populated zip codes , as opposed to 91% of zip codes with the lowest population densities .

similarly , for zip codes ranked by median family income , high - speed subscribers were reported present in 99% of the top one - tenth of zip codes , as compared to 92% of the bottom one - tenth of zip codes .

similarly , 2008 data from the pew internet & american life project indicate that while broadband adoption is growing in urban , suburban , and rural areas , broadband users make up larger percentages of urban and suburban users than rural users .

pew found that the percentage of all u.s. adults with broadband at home is 60% for suburban areas , 57% for urban areas , and 38% for rural areas .

some policymakers assert that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse consequences on those left behind .

many believe that advanced internet applications — voice over the internet protocol ( voip ) or high quality video , for example — and the resulting ability for businesses and consumers to engage in e - commerce , may increasingly depend on high speed broadband connections to the internet .

thus , some say , communities and individuals without access to broadband could be at risk to the extent that e - commerce becomes a critical factor in determining future economic development and prosperity .

rapid technological advances and the resulting convergence of telecommunications providers and markets has prompted the reexamination of the existing telecommunications industry regulatory framework .

the "telecommunications act of 1996," ( p.l .

104-104 ) redefined and recast the 1934 communications act to address the emergence of competition in what were previously considered to be monopolistic markets .

despite its relatively recent enactment , however , a consensus has been growing that the modifications brought about by the implementation of the 1996 act are not sufficient to address the nation's changing telecommunications environment .

technological changes such as the advancement of internet technology to supply data , voice , and video as well as the growing convergence in the telecommunications sector , have , according to many policymakers , made it necessary to consider another "rewrite" or revision of the laws governing these markets .

the regulatory debate focuses on a number of issues including the extent to which existing regulations should be applied to traditional providers as they enter new markets where they do not hold market power , the extent to which existing regulations should be imposed on new entrants as they compete with traditional providers in the same markets , and the appropriate regulatory framework to be imposed on new and / or converging technologies that are not easily classified under the present framework .

the regulatory treatment of broadband technologies continues to hold a major focus in the policy debate .

a major facet of the debate centers on whether present laws and regulations are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits , or , conversely , whether such laws and policies are overly burdensome and discourage needed investment and deployment of such services .

what if any role regulators should play to ensure the internet remains open to all , often referred to as "open access" requirements or "net neutrality," is also a major and contentious part of the dialogue .

in addition to the debate over economic regulation , concern over how and to what extent "social regulations" such as emergency 911 access , disability access , and law enforcement regulations , should be applied to new and converging technologies continues to be debated .

the continued growth and expressed interest in municipal broadband networks has also focused debate on what the appropriate role of the government sector should be and whether it should be competing with the private sector .

how traditional policy goals , such as the advancement of universal service mandates , should be revised to accommodate the changing marketplace has also come under scrutiny .

for example , issues such as who should receive and who should contribute to universal service funds and whether the definition of universal service objectives should be expanded to include new technologies such as broadband continue to be debated .

in the 109 th congress , debate over broadband policy primarily centered on h.r .

5252 — the communications opportunity , promotion , and enhancement act ( cope ) in the house , and the advanced telecommunications and opportunity reform act ( ator ) in the senate .

h.r .

5252 addressed a number of issues , including the extent to which legacy regulations should be applied to traditional providers as they enter new markets , the extent to which legacy regulations should be imposed on new entrants as they compete with traditional providers in their markets , the treatment of new and converging technologies , and the emergence of municipal broadband networks and internet access .

h.r .

5252 , as amended , passed ( 321-101 ) the house , was significantly amended and passed ( 15-7 ) by the senate commerce committee , but did not reach the senate floor for consideration .

h.r .

5252 ( cope ) .

house commerce committee chairman barton , on march 27 , 2006 , released a draft telecommunications reform proposal that was the subject of a committee hearing on march 30 , 2006 .

the then unnumbered measure , passed ( 27-4 ) the subcommittee , with amendment , on april 5 , 2006 , and passed ( 42-12 ) the full committee with amendment , on april 26 , 2006 .

the measure , titled "the communications opportunity , promotion , and enhancement act of 2006" ( cope ) , was referred to the house committee on energy and commerce and formally introduced as h.r .

5252 .

a sequential referral request , by house judiciary chairman sensenbrenner , which was subsequently denied , delayed floor consideration .

the house passed ( 321-101 ) an amended version of h.r .

5252 on june 8 , 2006 .

in addition to a manager's amendment clarifying franchising provisions , five additional amendments were passed .

the other amendments: established a complaint process to resolve fee disputes between a local franchise authority and a cable operator ; increased the income discrimination penalty for a cable operator from $500,000 to $750,000 ; allowed a cable franchising authority to issue an order requiring compliance with fcc revised consumer protection rules ; preserved fcc authority to require voip providers to contribute to the federal universal service fund , when they connect directly or indirectly to the public switched network and compensate network owners for use of their network ; and clarified that language in h.r .

5252 giving the fcc the exclusive authority to adjudicate network neutrality does not remove antitrust authority over net neutrality complaints .

two amendments did not pass .

the first , an amendment , sponsored by representative markey , to strengthen net neutrality provisions failed by a vote of 152-269 .

the second , to reduce , from 1 percent to 0.5 percent , the fee paid to local franchise authorities relating to peg / inet support by women - owned , small business and socially and economically disadvantaged firms was withdrawn .

h.r .

5252 , as passed by the house , contained in its 6 titles , provisions that would establish a national cable franchising process ; clarify the fcc's authority to enforce its network neutrality principles ; address voip 911 interconnection and e911 requirements ; and bar states from prohibiting municipalities from providing their own broadband networks .

more specifically , title i establishes a national process , through the fcc , for new entrants to offer pay tv services and opens it up to incumbent cable providers , once they face local competition .

an operator of a national franchise is prohibited from discriminating in the provision of service to any group of residential subscribers based on the income of that group .

national consumer protection rules are established with a local authority / fcc complaint procedure .

additional provisions in title i preserve the local five percent franchise fee cap , preserve and support peg channel and i - nets or institutional networks ( a one percent gross revenue fee is established to ensure financial support ) , and preserve rights - of - way requirements .

the bill also contains provisions to assist small and rural carriers in the provision of video service by allowing video operators to share a headend transmission facility .

title ii clarifies the fcc's authority to enforce its august 2005 network neutrality principles in complaint proceedings , but prohibits the fcc from engaging in related - rulemaking .

fines up to $500,000 per violation are established and the fcc is required to resolve complaints within 90 days .

the fcc is also directed to conduct and submit to the house energy and commerce and senate commerce committees , within 180 days of enactment , a study , to evaluate ".... whether the objectives of the ( fcc's ) broadband policy statement and the principles incorporated therein are being achieved. .

the remaining four titles dealt with a wide range of telecommunications issues .

title iii of the bill contains provisions to establish 911 and e - 911 requirements for voip services that connect to the public switched network and represent a replacement telephone service .

additional provisions provide access to the nation's 911 infrastructure and requires the fcc to appoint a 911 number administrator .

title iv contains provisions that bar states from prohibiting municipalities from providing their own broadband networks ( that is telecommunications , information , or cable services ) , but also requires that they do not discriminate in favor of , or bestow any advantages to , such entities as compared with other providers of such services .

the fcc is tasked with submitting within one year of enactment , a report to congress , on the status of the provision of such services by municipalities .

titles v and vi contain provisions that ensue consumers can buy stand - alone broadband service ; call for an fcc study to examine the possible interference associated with the deployment of broadband over power lines ; and further the development of "seamless mobility. .

s. 2686 ( h.r .

5252 / ator ) .

the senate commerce committee held a series of hearings on a wide range of telecommunications issues in preparation for developing comprehensive telecommunications legislation .

senate commerce committee chairman stevens introduced , on may 1 , 2006 , a comprehensive ( 135 page ) telecommunications bill , s. 2686 .

the major provisions of that measure dealt with a wide range of topics , including universal service reform ; streamlining of the video franchising process ; requiring the fcc to report annually to congress on the net neutrality issue ; interoperability of public safety communications systems ; interconnection ; and municipal broadband ownership .

the bill also contains a number of provisions relating to broadcast issues such as the digital television transition , the reinstating of the fcc's "broadcast flag" rules , access to sports programming , and use of unlicensed "white space. .

additional provisions relating to protecting children from child pornography and amending the fcc's "sunshine rules" are also included .

although senator inouye , the ranking minority member of the committee , signed on as a bill co - sponsor , he stated that s. 2686 needed considerable amendment to gain his support .

he circulated a draft proposal containing provisions addressing video franchising , internet access , broadband deployment , and universal service , for consideration that addressed his concerns .

the lack of a strong net neutrality provision was one of the issues he specifically singled out for attention .

s. 2686 provisions relating to streamlining the video franchising process , universal service fund reform , and net neutrality were the major focus of commerce committee hearing held on may 18 , and may 25,2006 .

the commerce committee issued a revised draft of the bill which was the subject of a hearing held on june 13 , 2006 .

after a lengthy and intense markup the senate commerce committee approved ( 15-7 ) on june 28 , 2006 the newly titled "advanced telecommunications and opportunity reform act," which technically is an amended version in the nature of a substitute for h.r .

5252 .

in addition to a new bill name and number the three - day markup led to the approval of a significant manager's amendment containing a new title and 70 amendments resulting in the passage of a 200-plus page omnibus telecommunications measure .

s. 2686 , which was referred to as "the senate committee passed version of h.r .

5252 ," contains 11 titles covering a wide range of telecommunications issues including video franchise reform , net neutrality , universal service reform , municipal broadband , broadcast flag , the digital television transition , interoperability , the illegal transmission of child pornography , and fcc reform .

the issue of net neutrality proved to be major point of contention during the markup .

despite the addition of a new title ( title ix ) establishing an "internet consumer bill of rights" net neutrality advocates continued to press for a net neutrality non - discrimination provision .

a nondiscrimination amendment offered during markup was defeated by an 11-11 vote .

the lack of a cable franchise build - out provision , federal preemption of state authority over wireless services , as well as provisions added during markup to exempt , for three years , wireless providers from "new and discriminatory" taxes and make permanent the internet tax moratorium also resulted in concern .

while senator steven's continued to express confidence that the senate version of h.r .

5252 would come to the floor for a vote , the 109 th congress ended without full senate consideration of the measure .

both the senate and house judiciary committees also examined issues related to telecommunications reform .

the house judiciary's telecommunications and antitrust task force held a hearing on april 25 , 2006 , to examine competition issues relating to internet access and "net neutrality. .

house judiciary committee chairman sensenbrenner and representative conyers , the ranking minority member , stated , in a letter sent to then house speaker hastert , that the judiciary committee had oversight over market conditions , consolidations and antitrust protections in the telecommunications sector , and asked for a sequential referral of h.r .

5252 .

that request was denied .

however , chairman sensenbrenner , representative conyers and others introduced a bipartisan bill ( h.r .

5417 ) focusing on internet access from an antitrust perspective , that passed ( 20-13 ) the judiciary committee , with amendment , on may 25 , 2006 .

a request to the house rules committee to have the bill considered as an amendment during house floor action on h.r .

5252 was denied .

the senate judiciary committee held a june 14 , 2006 hearing to examine communications laws in the context of ensuring competition and innovation .

in the 110 th congress , legislation was introduced that would provide financial assistance for broadband deployment .

of particular note is the reauthorization and reform of the rural utilities service ( rus ) broadband loan program , which was enacted as part of the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-234 ) .

p.l .

110-234 also contains provisions establishing a national center for rural telecommunications assessment and requiring the fcc and rus to formulate a comprehensive rural broadband strategy .

the broadband data improvement act ( p.l .

110-385 ) was also enacted and requires the fcc to collect demographic information on unserved areas , data comparing broadband service with 75 communities in at least 25 nations abroad , and data on consumer use of broadband .

the act also directs the census bureau to collect broadband data , the government accountability office to study broadband data metrics and standards , and the department of commerce to provide grants supporting state broadband initiatives .
