this report focuses on fy2017 appropriations for interior , environment , and related agencies .

at issue for congress is d etermining the amount of funding for agencies and programs in the bill and the terms and conditions of such funding .

this report first presents a brief overview of the agencies in the bill .

it then provides a description of the appropriations requested by president obama for fy2017 .

next , it compares the president's request for fy2017 with appropriations enacted for fy2016 .

it then compares the fy2017 house - passed and senate - committee reported appropriations with each other , with fy2016 enacted appropriations , and with fy2017 appropriations requested by the president .

finally , it summarizes the continuing appropriations enacted for fy2017 , first through december 9 , 2016 ( under division c , p.l .

114-223 ) , and then through april 28 , 2017 ( under division a , p.l .

114-254 ) .

appropriations are complex .

budget justifications for requests for some agencies are large , generally several hundred pages long and containing numerous funding , programmatic , and legislative changes for congressional consideration .

further , appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts , activities , and sub - activities , and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information .

this report does not provide information at the account and sub - account levels , nor does it detail budgetary reorganizations or legislative changes enacted in law or proposed by the president .

for information on a particular agency or individual accounts , programs , or activities administered by a particular agency , contact the key policy staff listed at the end of this report .

in addition , for selected reports related to appropriations for interior , environment , and related agencies , such as individual agencies ( eg , national park service ) or cross - cutting programs ( eg , wildland fire management ) , see the "interior & environment appropriations" subissue under the "appropriations" issue area page on the congressional research service ( crs ) website .

the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments as well as for numerous related agencies .

the interior bill typically contains three primary titles .

title i provides funding for most department of the interior ( doi ) agencies , many of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs .

title ii contains appropriations for the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .

title iii currently funds 20 agencies in other departments , such as the forest service in the department of agriculture and the indian health service in the department of health and human services ; arts and cultural agencies , such as the smithsonian institution ; and various other entities .

title iii of the bill is referred to as "related agencies. .

selected major agencies in the interior bill are briefly described below .

for fy2017 , president obama requested $33.18 billion for the approximately 30 agencies and entities typically funded in the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill .

for the 10 major doi agencies in title i of the bill , the request was $12.24 billion , or 36.9% of the total requested .

for epa , funded in title ii of the bill , the request was $8.27 billion , or 24.9% of the total .

for the 20 agencies and other entities currently funded in title iii of the bill , the request was $12.67 billion , or 38.2% of the total .

the president's request included a proposal for a new adjustment to the discretionary spending limits in law that would provide an additional $1.15 billion for wildfire suppression for fy2017 .

of the total proposed adjustment for fy2017 , $290.0 million was for doi wildland fire management and $864.1 million was for forest service wildland fire management .

appropriations for agencies vary widely for reasons relating to the number , breadth , and complexity of agency responsibilities ; alternative sources of funding ( eg , mandatory appropriations ) ; and administration and congressional priorities , among other factors .

thus , although the president's fy2017 request covered approximately 30 agencies , funding for a small subset of these agencies accounted for most of the total .

for example , the requested appropriations for three agencies — epa , forest service , and indian health service — were nearly three - fifths ( 57.9% ) of the total request .

further , more than three - quarters ( 76.0% ) of the request was for these three agencies and two others , national park service and indian affairs .

for doi agencies , the fy2017 requests ranged from $80.2 million for the bureau of ocean energy management to $3.10 billion for the national park service .

the requests for 6 of the 10 agencies exceeded $1 billion .

nearly half ( 49.3% ) of the $12.24 billion requested for doi agencies was for two agencies — indian affairs ( $2.93 billion ) and the national park service .

for related agencies in title iii , the requested funding levels exhibited even more variation .

the president sought amounts ranging from $1.4 million for grants under national capital arts and cultural affairs to $5.74 billion for the forest service .

the indian health service would be the only other agency to receive more than $5 billion .

the next - largest request was for the smithsonian institution , at $922.2 million .

by contrast , 14 agencies would receive less than $80 million each , including 5 with appropriations of less than $10 million each .

figure 1 identifies the share of the president's request for particular agencies in the interior bill .

table 1 , at the end of this report , contains the amount requested by the president for fy2017 for each agency , fy2016 enacted appropriations for each agency , the percentage change between fy2016 enacted appropriations and the president's request for fy2017 , the appropriations included in h.r .

5538 ( 114 th congress ) as passed the house , and the appropriations contained in s. 3068 ( 114 th congress ) as reported by the senate appropriations committee .

the president's request of $33.18 billion for fy2017 would have been an increase of $250.6 million ( 0.8% ) over the total fy2016 enacted appropriations of $32.93 billion .

this fy2016 total includes $700.0 million in emergency funding for wildland fire management by the forest service ( p.l .

114-53 , section 135 ) .

these funds were provided for urgent fire suppression , but also could be transferred to other accounts to repay monies that had been borrowed for fire suppression .

unlike the president's fy2017 request , the fy2016 enacted appropriations did not include a cap adjustment to discretionary spending limits in law ( for wildland fire management ) .

the fy2016 appropriations included $452.0 million for the payments in lieu of taxes ( pilt ) program , whereas the president did not seek discretionary funding for pilt for fy2017 .

instead , the president supported mandatory funding for pilt for fy2017 , which would require a change in law .

pilt compensates counties and local governments for nontaxable lands within their jurisdictions .

under the president's proposal , the total for two of the three titles of the bill would have increased by different amounts .

doi agencies would have received an increase of $225.8 million ( 1.9% ) and funding for epa would have increased by $127.3 million ( 1.6% ) .

however , the total for all related agencies in title iii would have decreased by $102.5 million ( 0.8% ) .

with regard to doi , the president proposed increases above fy2016 enacted levels for 8 of the 10 agencies .

the increases varied in dollar amount and percentage of appropriations , with the lowest dollar increase of $6.0 million ( 8.0% ) for the bureau of ocean energy management and the highest of $250.2 million ( 8.8% ) for the national park service .

some of the national park service increase was intended to enhance park units in light of the agency's 2016 centennial .

activities receiving additional funds included repair , rehabilitation , and maintenance of facilities ; line item construction ; visitor services for young people and families ; historic preservation ; and the centennial challenge program ( a federal matching program to leverage donations for park units ) .

in addition to the national park service , three other doi agencies would have received increases of more than $100.0 million under the president's request .

proposed increases were as follows: department - wide programs , $170.3 million ( 15.8% ) ; indian affairs , $137.6 million ( 4.9% ) ; and u.s. geological survey , $106.8 million ( 10.1% ) .

under department - wide programs , wildland fire management on doi lands received the largest increase .

the second - largest increase was for the working capital fund , primarily for cybersecurity and doi compliance with the digital accountability and transparency act of 2014 ( data act , p.l .

113-101 ) .

for indian affairs , the president requested increases for many activities , among them education , natural resource management , and social services .

for the u.s. geological survey , the president requested additional funds across agency activities , including ecosystems , climate and land use change , natural hazards , water resources , and facilities .

two doi agencies , departmental offices and the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement , would have received decreased appropriations under the president's fy2017 request .

for departmental offices , the decrease was primarily because the president did not seek discretionary funding under this account for pilt , as noted .

for the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement , the decrease was primarily because the president did not request to continue the fy2016 appropriation of $90.0 million for grants to three states for reclamation of abandoned mine lands , together with economic and community development activities .

within the overall increase for epa , the president sought additional funds for each of the agency's accounts except state and tribal assistance grants .

the $239.2 million ( 9.2% ) increase for the environmental programs and management account was the largest overall dollar increase proposed for epa accounts .

this account funds a broad array of activities supporting epa's development and enforcement of pollution - control regulations and standards , technical assistance , and administrative and operational expenses .

the $40.2 million ( 3.7% ) increase for the hazardous substance superfund account was the second - largest overall dollar increase for epa accounts .

this account supports the assessment and cleanup of sites contaminated from the release of hazardous substances .

epa administers these activities under the superfund program , as authorized in the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act of 1980 ( cercla ; 42 u.s.c .

§§9601 et seq. ) .

the president also sought $50.0 million for the water infrastructure finance and innovation program , through a proposed new account to consolidate resources for loans to improve water infrastructure .

the overall decrease from fy2016 enacted levels proposed for epa's account for state and tribal assistance grants ( $237.8 million , or 6.8% ) included both decreases and increases for programs within the account .

for instance , grants to states for wastewater infrastructure projects through the clean water state revolving fund would have declined by $414.4 million ( 29.7% ) , whereas funding for drinking water infrastructure grants to states through the drinking water state revolving fund would have increased by $157.3 million ( 18.2% ) .

thirteen of the 20 title iii agencies would have received increases over fy2016 enacted levels under the president's fy2017 proposal , and two of the three largest agencies would have received the biggest dollar increases .

specifically , the president sought an additional $377.4 million ( 7.9% ) for the indian health service and $82.0 million ( 9.8% ) for the smithsonian institution .

the indian health service increases were for many programs and activities , including hospitals and health clinics , mental health , alcohol and substance abuse , contract support costs , and construction of health care and other facilities .

the smithsonian institution's additional funds were to be directed to facilities maintenance , operations , security , and construction , among other purposes .

by contrast , two title iii agencies would have received level funding and five agencies would have received decreases .

the president proposed the largest dollar decrease for the forest service — a $623.9 million ( 9.8% ) reduction — primarily through lower funding for wildand fire management for fy2017 .

this was largely because the fy2016 total reflects the enactment of additional emergency appropriations for wildland fire managemen .

h.r .

5538 , as passed by the house on july 14 , 2016 , would have provide d $32.1 5 billion for interior , environment , and related agencies for fy201 7 .

s. 3068 , as reported by the senate appropriations committee on june 16 , 201 6 , would have provide d $3 2.76 billion for interior , environment , and related agencies .

both bills included $480.0 million for pilt .

the house - passed bill included this funding in the doi departmental offices account , with funding for the office of the secretary .

the senate included pilt funding in the department - wide programs account .

see table 1 for the house - passed and senate committee - reported funding levels for each title and agency in the interior bill .

the bills differed in the amount and type of funding for addressing wildland fires .

overall , the senate bill contained $521.6 million ( 13.3% ) more than the house bill .

the senate bill contained a total of $4.45 billion for wildland fire management , composed of $1.1 1 billion for doi and $3.33 billion for the forest service .

the s enate total included $ 661.3 million in emergency appropriations for managing wildland fires , with $171.3 million for doi and $490.0 million for the forest service .

such emergency funding typically does not count toward a subcommittee ' s allocation for the bill .

the house - passed bill did not include emergency appropriations , but instead provided a portion of the funding through the flame wildfire suppression reserve accounts .

it contained a total of $3.92 billion for managing w ildland f ire s , with $943.9 million for doi and $ 2.98 billion for the forest service .

the inclusion of emergency appropriations in the senate committee - reported bill contributed to a larger overall appropriation in s. 3068 than in h.r .

5538 .

the senate bill was $615.7 million ( 1.9% ) more than the house - passed bill .

similarly , the emergency funding was a factor in the larger appropriations in s. 3068 for doi agencies ( $151.1 million , 1.2% higher ) , the forest service ( $307.3 million , 5.7% higher ) , and title iii agencies overall ( $224.0 million , 1.8% higher ) .

the senate committee - reported bill also contained higher amounts than h.r .

5538 for some other major agencies , including epa ( $240.6 million , 3.1% higher ) .

while the measures included differing amounts for many epa accounts , more funding in the senate bill for the environmental programs and management account and the clean water state revolving fund ( srf , in the state and tribal assistance grants account ) contributed to the overall higher senate bill total .

however , the house bill provided higher funding for some agencies than the senate measure .

for instance , it would have funded the indian health service at $5.08 billion , which was $84.9 million ( 1.7% ) more than the $4.99 billion in s. 3068 .

the house bill had higher appropriations for clinical services , among other indian health service programs .

both h.r .

5538 as passed by the house and s. 3068 as reported from the senate appropriations committee would provide lower appropriations than enacted for fy2016 ( $32.93 billion ) .

one contributor to the lower overall bill totals was lower funding for wildland fires relative to the fy2016 enacted level ( $4.90 billion ) .

as noted , the fy2016 total appropriation included $700.0 million in additional , emergency funding for forest service wildland fire management .

for both doi and forest service wildfires , h.r .

5538 had $978.4 million ( 20.0% ) less than fy2016 appropriations , whereas s. 3068 contained $456.8 million ( 9.3% ) less than the fy2016 level .

like the fy2016 appropriation , the house and senate bills contained discretionary funding for pilt .

pilt would have received a $28.0 million ( 6.2% ) increase under both bills , from $452.0 million in fy2016 to $480.0 million in fy2017 .

the $32.15 billion for fy2017 in h.r .

5538 , as passed by the house , was $779.3 million ( 2.4% ) less than the fy2016 appropriation of $32.93 billion .

doi agencies , however , would have received an overall increase of $112.7 million ( 0.9% ) for fy2017 , with 6 of the 10 doi agencies sharing in the increase .

the largest recommended dollar increase was $78.8 million ( 2.8% ) for the national park service , with increases for facility operations and maintenance , construction , the historic preservation fund , the centennial challenge federal matching program , and other activities .

the next largest dollar increase was $73.8 million ( 2.6% ) for indian affairs , with increases for human services , elementary and secondary education programs , and other programs .

h.r .

5538 would have reduced epa funding by $271.8 million ( 3.3% ) relative to fy2016 appropriations .

the account with the largest dollar decline was environmental programs and management , with $207.2 million ( 7.9% ) less than fy2016 .

programs in the account that would have been reduced included clean air and climate ; enforcement ; information exchange and outreach ; and legal , science , regulatory , and economic review .

the epa account with the second - largest reduction was state and tribal assistance grants , with $147.4 million ( 4.2% ) less than fy2016 , largely from lower funds for grants to states through the clean water srf .

in contrast , the house bill increased appropriations for the drinking water srf , and provided $50.0 million for a new account to fund the water infrastructure finance and innovation act ( wifia ) program .

title iii agencies would have received an overall decrease of $620.2 million ( 4.9% ) for fy2017 under h.r .

5538 .

the largest dollar reduction — of $926.6 million ( 14.6% ) — was to go to the forest service , largely from lower funding for wildland fire management .

a total of three agencies would have received lower amounts than enacted in fy2016 , and eight others would have received level funding .

funds for nine agencies would have increased , with the largest dollar amount — $271.0 million ( 5.6% ) — for the indian health service .

additional funds were included for clinical services , such as hospital and health clinics , contract support costs , and construction of health care and other facilities .

with regard to the senate bill , the $32.76 billion for interior , environment , and related agencies was $163.6 million ( 0.5% ) less than fy2016 appropriations of $32.93 billion .

doi agencies , however , would have received an overall increase of $263.8 million ( 2.2% ) for fy2017 , with 6 of the 10 doi agencies sharing in the increase .

the largest recommended dollar increase in s. 3068 was $600.2 million ( 55.6% ) for department - wide programs , whereas the largest recommended dollar decrease was $449.9 million ( 41.7% ) for departmental offices .

these differences primarily resulted from funding pilt through different accounts — under departmental offices in fy2016 but under department - wide programs in s. 3068 .

within the department - wide programs account , the senate bill also contained an additional $120.2 million ( 12.1% ) for doi wildland fire management .

the senate bill also included increases over the fy2016 level of $62.7 million ( 2.2% ) for the national park service and $58.5 million ( 2.1% ) for indian affairs .

s. 3068 would have funded epa at $31.2 million ( 0.4% ) less than the fy2016 appropriation .

the epa account with the largest dollar decrease was environmental programs and management , with $75.1 million ( 2.9% ) less than fy2016 .

as with the house bill , programs in the account that were reduced included clean air and climate ; enforcement ; information exchange and outreach ; and legal , science , regulatory , and economic review .

funding in the account for water quality protection also declined .

the epa account with the largest dollar increase in s. 3068 was state and tribal assistance grants , with $95.2 million ( 2.7% ) more than fy2016 appropriations .

while funding for some programs in the account would have increased , such as for the drinking water srf and certain categorical grants , funding for other programs would have been reduced , such as for the clean water srf , diesel emission grants , and multi - purpose grants .

the senate bill also provided $30.0 million for a new account to fund the wifia program .

title iii agencies would have decreased by $396.2 million ( 3.1% ) in fy2017 under s. 3068 .

the largest dollar reduction — of $619.4 million ( 9.7% ) — was for the forest service , largely from lower funding for wildland fires .

a total of three agencies would have received lower amounts than enacted in fy2016 , and eight others would have received level funding .

funds for nine agencies would have increased , with the largest amount — of $186.2 million ( 3.9% ) — for the indian health service .

additional funds were included for clinical services ( such as hospital and health clinics , mental health , and alcohol and substance abuse ) , contract support costs , and construction of facilities .

both the house - passed and senate committee - reported bills contained lower funding for fy2017 than sought by the president .

this was the case although the president's request did not include discretionary appropriations for pilt , whereas the house and senate bills contained $480.0 million for the program .

as noted , the administration instead sought mandatory funding for pilt .

among other differences , the president sought at least $100.0 million more than either bill provided for each of the following agencies: national park service , epa , and indian health service .

the president and the house and senate bills proposed somewhat different ways of funding wildland fires in fy2017 .

neither the house nor the senate legislation included funding for wildland fire management through a new adjustment to the discretionary spending limits in law , as proposed by the president .

however , the senate bill contained provisions ( title v ) to enact such a structure , and the house appropriations committee expressed support for such a budgetary adjustment mechanism .

only the house bill provided a portion of wildland fire funding through the flame wildfire suppression reserve accounts , and only the senate bill provided a portion of wildfire funding as emergency appropriations .

the $32.15 billion for fy2017 in h.r .

5538 , as passed by the house , was $1.03 billion ( 3.1% ) lower than the president's fy2017 requested appropriations of $33.18 billion .

the house bill contained less funding than the request for each of the three titles of the bill .

doi agencies would have received $113.1 ( 0.9% ) less , with lower appropriations for 8 of the 10 agencies .

the largest dollar decrease was $220.1 million ( 17.6% ) for department - wide programs , with each major activity in the account accorded lower funding .

the next largest dollar decrease in the house bill — $171.4 million ( 5.5% ) — was for the national park service .

however , the house - passed bill would have provided $440.3 million ( 68.1% ) more than sought by the president for departmental offices , due to the inclusion of funding for pilt in this account .

h.r .

5538 also contained $93.7 million ( 59.3% ) more than requested for the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement .

the house bill , unlike the president's request , would have funded grants to states for reclamation of abandoned mines with economic and community development and reuse purposes .

epa funding would have been $399.1 million ( 4.8% ) lower under the house bill than requested by the president for fy2017 .

h.r .

5538 provided the environmental programs and management account with $446.4 million ( 15.6% ) less than the president's request .

programs in the account that would have received lower funding included clean air and climate ; enforcement ; information exchange and outreach ; it , data management , and security ; legal , science , regulatory , and economic review ; and operations and administration .

not all accounts would have received less funding under the house bill .

for instance , the state and tribal assistance grants account would have been funded at $90.3 million ( 2.8% ) more under h.r .

5538 , with higher amounts for a variety of infrastructure assistance grants — the drinking water and clean water srfs , diesel emission grants , and targeted air shed grants .

under h.r .

5538 , title iii agencies would have been funded at $517.7 million ( 4.1% ) less for fy2017 than sought by the president .

while the bill contained level funding for 8 agencies and increases for 3 , 9 of the 20 agencies in title iii would have received lower funds , with the largest dollar reductions for the three largest agencies .

for the forest service , the house bill included $302.7 million ( 5.3% ) less than the administration requested , primarily from lower funding for wildland fire management .

h.r .

5538 would have funded the indian health service at $106.4 million ( 2.1% ) less than the request , with lower amounts for clinical services , including hospital and health clinics , and construction of health care facilities .

the house bill contained $58.9 million ( 6.4% ) less than the request for the smithsonian institution , mainly due to lower funding for salaries and expenses for museums and research institutes , and for facilities - related programs , including maintenance ; operations , security , and support ; and planning and design .

additionally , the house bill would not have funded the dwight d. eisenhower memorial commission , for which the president requested a total of $44.8 million , primarily to construct a memorial .

the $32.76 billion total in s. 3068 was $ 414.2 million ( 1.2 % ) less than the administration's request of $33.18 billion .

nevertheless , s. 3068 would have increase d doi agencies by $ 38.0 million ( 0.3 % ) for fy2017 , primarily because the bill contained discretionary funding for pilt whereas the president's request did not .

specifically , for the account that would fund pilt — department - wide programs — s. 3068 contained $429.9 million ( 34.4% ) more than the president sought .

s. 3068 also included $78.9 million ( 50.0% ) more than requested for the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement .

like the house bill , s. 3068 would have fund ed grants to states for reclamation of abandoned mines with economic and community development and reuse purposes ; the president did not request funds for this purpose .

the other eight agencies in title i would have receive d lower appropriations under s. 3068 than requested by the president .

the largest dollar decrease in the senate bill — $187.5 million ( 6.0% ) — was for the national park service , with lower appropriations than requested for visitor services , facility operations and maintenance , the historic preservation fund , construction , and other programs .

the senate bill contained $158.5 million ( 1.9% ) less for epa than the president sought for fy2017 .

the epa account with the largest dollar decrease was environmental programs and management , with $314.3 million ( 11.0% ) less than the administration's request .

as with the house bill , programs in the account that received lower funding under s. 3068 included clean air and climate ; enforcement ; information exchange and outreach ; it , data management , and security ; legal , science , regulatory , and economic review ; and operations and administration .

some accounts would have received more funds under s. 3068 than requested .

as with the house bill , the epa account with the largest dollar increase was state and tribal assistance grants , with $332.9 million ( 10.1% ) more than requested by the president for fy2017 .

higher funding would have been directed to the clean water srf and other infrastructure assistance grants , among other programs .

title iii agencies would have received $293.6 million ( 2.3% ) less for fy2017 under s. 3068 than under the president's request for fy2017 .

nine of the 20 agencies in title iii would have received lower funding .

the largest dollar difference was with regard to the indian health service .

s. 3068 provided $191.2 million ( 3.7% ) less than requested , with lower funds for clinical services , including hospital and health clinics , and construction of health care facilities , among other programs .

the senate bill also contained $62.0 million ( 6.7% ) less than the request for the smithsonian institution , mainly due to lower funding for various facilities - related programs , including maintenance ; operations , security , and support ; revitalization ; and planning and design .

additionally , s. 3068 did not fund construction of a memorial to dwight d. eisenhower , while continuing appropriations for salaries and expenses of the memorial commission .

the president had sought $43.0 million for capital construction , in addition to funding for salaries and expenses of the commission .

s. 3068 contained higher funds than requested for four agencies , and the bill and the request included the same amount for another seven agencies .

only the senate bill contained funding ( $2.0 million ) for the women's suffrage centennial commission , which would have been established by the bill .

continuing funds were provided for fy2017 through april 28 , 2017 , under the further continuing appropriations act , 2017 ( cr ; division a , p.l .

114-254 ) .

continuing appropriations were provided because no regular appropriations for interior , environment , and related agencies were enacted before the start of the 2017 fiscal year on october 1 , 2016 .

the cr generally provided funding at the fy2016 level ( in division g , p.l .

114-113 ) , minus an across - the - board reduction of 0.1901% for the period covered .

it also generally provided funds for continuing projects and activities , under the same authority and conditions and to the same extent and manner , as for fy2016 .

an earlier cr , the continuing appropriations act , 2017 ( division c , p.l .

114-223 ) , provided continuing appropriations through december 9 , 2016 .

that cr also generally provided funding for interior , environment , and related agencies at the fy2016 level , but with an across - the - board reduction of 0.496% .

the first and the second cr each contained five exceptions related to interior , environment , and related agencies .

these 10 "anomalies" changed the purposes or amounts of funds , extended expiring provisions of law , or made other changes in existing law , as follows: section 133 extended , through september 30 , 2018 , the authority in the federal lands recreation enhancement act for five agencies to establish , collect , and retain recreation fees on federal recreational lands and waters .

section 134 extended , through the duration of the cr , the dwight d. eisenhower memorial commission's authorization to establish a "permanent" memorial to president eisenhower in the district of columbia .

it also suspended language in the fy2016 appropriations law that prohibits the secretary of the interior , during fy2016 , from issuing a construction permit to build the eisenhower memorial until 100% of the necessary funds are raised .

section 135 provided $26.0 million for the bureau of land management to process , at the start of fy2017 , new applications for permits to drill on federal and indian land .

the $26.0 million in up - front revenue would be offset by an equal amount later , as application fees are collected throughout the year .

section 136 increased funding for the national park service by $4.2 million to support security and visitor safety activities related to the presidential inaugural ceremonies in january 2017 .

section 137 provided epa with an additional $3.0 million for fy2017 , within the environmental programs and management account , for operations and necessary expenses of activities as defined in §26 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) .

it also authorized fees collected in fy2017 and credited to the tsca service fee fund to be counted as discretionary offsetting receipts toward the $3.0 million appropriation .
