numerous natural disastersâincluding the 2017 hurricane season and devastating wildfires in californiaâserved as catalysts for significant recent changes in federal emergency management policy .

most of these policy changes were included in the disaster recovery reform act of 2018 ( drra ) , which was included as division d of the faa reauthorization act of 2018 ( p.l .

115-254 ) .

drra is the most comprehensive reform of the federal emergency management agency's ( fema's ) disaster assistance programs since the passage of the sandy recovery improvement act of 2013 ( sria , division b of p.l .

113-2 ) and the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( pkemra , p.l .

109-295 ) .

as with past disaster legislation , lessons learned following recent disasters revealed areas that could be improved through legislative and programmatic changes , including the need for increased preparedness and pre - disaster mitigation .

the legislative intent of drra includes improving disaster preparedness , response , recovery , and mitigation , including pre - disaster mitigation ; clarifying assistance program eligibility , processes , and limitations , including on the recoupment of funding ; and increasing fema's transparency and accountability .

thus , drra amends many sections of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( stafford act , p.l .

93-288 , as amended ; 42 u.s.c .

â§â§5121 et seq .

 ) , which provides the authority for the president to issue declarations of emergency and major disasters , and provides a range of federal assistance to local , state , territorial , and indian tribal governments , as well as certain private nonprofit organizations , and individuals and families .

in addition to numerous amendments to the stafford act , drra includes new standalone authorities , and requires reports to congress , rulemaking , and other actions .

this report is structured to first provide a tabular overview of the major changes that ddra made to the stafford act ( see table 1 ) .

the report then provides detailed explanations of the programmatic and procedural modifications to various disaster assistance programs under drra .

these drra modifications are grouped in the following sections: preparedness ; mitigation ; public assistance ; individual assistance ; flood plain management and flood insurance ; and other provisions .

in addition to a description of drra's changes to programs , each section includes potential policy considerations for congress .

appendix a includes the following tables of deadlines associated with drra's reporting , rulemaking / regulatory , and other implementation actions and requirements: table a - 1 , drra reporting requirements ( i.e. , reports to congress ) ; table a - 2 , drra rulemaking and regulations requirements ; and table a - 3 , drra guidance and other required actions .

a table of common acronyms used throughout this report is also included in table b - 1 of appendix b .

finally , a brief legislative history of drra is included in appendix c .

drra amends many sections of the stafford act , and establishes numerous reporting and rulemaking requirements .

the implementation of drra includes "more than 50 provisions that require fema policy or regulation changes...." thus , it could be argued that much of drra's implementation is at fema's discretion .

although fema is working on drra implementation , it is unclear at this time how fema will address many of drra's requirements and recommendations .

congress may oversee the implementation of drra through hearings or other inquiries to ensure that the post - drra changes to disaster assistance programs and policies fulfill congressional intent and the interests of congress .

congress may also review the effectiveness and impacts of fema's drra - related regulations and policy guidance , including assessing the effects of drra - related changes to federal assistance for past and future disasters .
