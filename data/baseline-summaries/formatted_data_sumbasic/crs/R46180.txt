this report analyzes the effects of historic wet conditions during the 2019 growing season on major u.s. field crops , primarily corn and soybeans .

these effects include record acres prevented from being planted , widespread delays in planting and harvesting of the corn and soybean crops , large crop insurance indemnity payments due to prevented plantings and weather - related yield losses , and additional ad hoc payments announced for producers experiencing both trade damage and losses from prevented planting .

this report focuses on corn and soybeansâthe two largest commercial crops grown in the united states in terms of number of producers , cultivated area , volume produced , and value of production .

together , they account for 54% of land planted to major field crops since 2010 .

they are critical inputs for several sectors , including the livestock , biofuels , food processing , and export sectors .

as a result , any delay or reduction from expected output for either of these crops can have important implications for market prices and the broader u.s. farm economy .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) forecasted an increased role of federal support for farm incomes in 2019âincluding $22.4 billion in direct support payments and $10.3 billion in federal crop insurance indemnity payments .

together , the forecast of usda farm support plus crop insurance indemnities of $32.7 billion represents a 35.3% share of u.s. net farm income $92.5 billion .

since 2010 , the federal crop insurance program has emerged as the largest component of the farm safety net in terms of taxpayer outlays , averaging $7.8 billion annually in premium subsidies .

while usda implements the federal crop insurance program , congress is responsible for authorizing and funding it .

the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the federal crop insurance act of 1980 ( p.l .

96-365 ) , as amended ( 7 u.s.c .

â§1501 et seq. ) .

and receives mandatory funding .

u.s. agricultural production got off to a late start in 2019 due to prolonged cool , wet springtime conditions throughout the major growing regions , particularly in states across the northern plains and eastern corn belt .

saturated soils prevented many farmers from planting their intended crops ( see text box below ) .

such acres are referred to as "prevent plant" ( ppl ) acres .

in addition to the unplanted acres , sizeable portions of the u.s. corn and soybean crops were planted later than usual , especially in illinois , michigan , missouri , ohio , wisconsin , and north and south dakota .

traditionally , 96% of the u.s. corn crop is planted by june 2 , but in 2019 by that date 67% of the crop had been planted ( figure 1 ) .

similarly , the u.s. soybean crop was planted with substantial delays .

by june 16 , 77% of the u.s. soybean crop was planted , whereas an average of 93% of the crop has been planted by that date during the previous five years ( figure 2 ) .

in addition to the ppl acres , large portions of the corn and soybean crops were planted two to four weeks later than usual ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .

such late planting meant that initial crop development would be behind normal across much of the major growing regions and that eventual yields would depend on beneficial weather extending late into the fall to achieve full crop maturity .

the late planting also rendered crop growth vulnerable to an early freeze in the fall .

widespread wet conditions continued into the fall , especially in the northern plains and western corn belt .

north dakota recorded the wettest september on record in 2019 , while iowa recorded the wettest october .

ultimately , much of the corn crop was harvested under wet conditions with high moisture content that required drying .

an early cold spell in the upper midwest had already heightened the demand for propane that , in addition to serving as the primary energy source for drying corn , is used to heat hog barns and for other farm operations .

this resulted in limited supplies and higher prices for propane .

many farmers chose to leave their corn in the field until more beneficial market conditions emerged .

as of december 16 , 2019âthe date of usda's final weekly crop progress report for 2019âan estimated 8% ( or 7.2 million acres ) of the u.s. corn crop had yet to be harvested , adding further to the uncertainty of yields and harvested acreage for the 2019 corn crop ( table 3 ) .

saturated soil conditions heading into the winter months suggest a continuation of wet conditions into the 2020 planting season and the potential for a repeat of planting difficulties in the months ahead .

these unusual conditions have come in the midst of a continued trade dispute between the united states and china that has dampened demand for u.s. agricultural products from one of the united states' principal foreign markets and has compelled the administration to undertake large ad hoc "trade aid" payments to producers of selected commodities .

the record ppl acreage has resulted in record crop insurance ppl indemnity payments under the ppl provisions of standard federal crop insurance policies in 2019 .

should wet conditions persist into 2020 and create a situation where farmers are again confronted with delayed or prevented planting , some producers may also bump up against a limit on the continued use of ppl .

under rma rules , ppl can be taken only for crops planted on an insured unit in one of the four preceding crop years .

thus , four consecutive years of ppl would result in ineligibility for the affected cropland .

furthermore , while crop insurance indemnities can help to offset some of the financial loss associated with prevented planting or poor harvests , they are not designed to cover all of the associated losses .

another concern for producers is the timing and clarity ( or lack thereof ) with respect to usda announcements about new payment programs that are linked to producer production choices .

in general , to avoid adversely influencing producer behaviorâa precept of most farm policiesâsuch announcements should be made either well in advance of the spring planting period or well after production decisions have been made .

a final looming concern for market watchers and policymakers is the increased role of usda payments to support farm incomes in 2019 .

usda forecasts $22.4 billion in direct support payments to the u.s. agricultural sector in 2019 , including $14.3 billion in direct payments made under trade aid programs as well as over $8 billion in payments from other farm programs .

in addition , usda forecasts $10.3 billion in federal crop insurance indemnity payments .

together , forecasts of usda farm support plus crop insurance indemnities combine for $32.7 billion in payments that represent a 35.3% share of usda's november forecast of 2019 net farm income of $92.5 billion .

without this federal support , net farm income would be lower , primarily due to continued weak prices for most major crops .

should these conditions persist into 2020 , they would signal the potential for continued dependence on federal programs to sustain farm incomes in 2020 .
