t he animal welfare act ( awa ; 7 u.s.c .

2131 et seq. ) .

is intended to ensure the humane treatment of animals that are intended for research , bred for commercial sale , exhibited to the public , or commercially transported .

under the awa , businesses and others with animals covered by the law must be licensed or registered , and they must adhere to minimum standards of care .

farm animals are among those not covered by the act , which nonetheless provides a broad set of statutory protections for animals .

the law was first passed in 1966 following several years of lobbying by animal welfare organizations and growing public outcry over allegations that large numbers of pets were being "dognapped" for sale to medical research laboratories .

congress amended the original law in 1970 , 1976 , 1985 , 1990 , and 2002 .

these amendments generally were intended to expand the scope of the awa or to clarify various provisions .

the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda's ) animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) administers the awa .

the house and senate agriculture committees have exercised primary legislative jurisdiction over the act and its amendments .

all licensed and registered entities must comply with usda - aphis regulations , including recordkeeping and published standards of care .

these standards deal with humane handling , shelter , space requirements , feeding , watering , sanitation , ventilation , veterinary care , and transport .

 ( awa regulations are found at 9 c.f.r .

ยง1.1 et seq. ) .

aphis's animal care ( ac ) program oversees implementation of the awa .

for 2015 , ac had an annual budget of approximately $28 million .

ac officials make unannounced inspections of registered and licensed facilities to ensure compliance with all rules .

under the awa , research facilities are to be inspected at least annually .

federal research institutions are exempt from awa licensing and inspection .

inspection frequency for other awa - regulated facilities is based on risk ; for example , moderate - risk facilities are to be visited about once yearly .

aphis inspectors also conduct searches to identify unlicensed or unregistered facilities .

failure to correct deficiencies can result in confiscation of animals , fines , cease - and - desist orders , or license suspensions .

in 2010 , usda's office of the inspector general ( oig ) released an audit of ac's investigations of large - scale dog dealers ( i.e. , breeders and brokers ) that failed to provide humane treatment for the animals under their care .

in a previous audit of laboratory animals , the oig found that ac did not aggressively pursue enforcement actions against violators of awa .

the may 2010 audit determined that ( 1 ) ac's enforcement process was ineffective against dealers with repeated violations ; ( 2 ) aphis misused its guidelines to lower penalties for awa violators ; and ( 3 ) some large breeders circumvented awa by selling animals over the internet .

aphis concurred with the oig's findings and implemented 13 of the 14 recommendations , including a change in the definition of retail pet store to no longer exempt retail pet stores that were not selling animals in face - to - face transactions .

in march 2015 , aphis filed public notices in the federal register regarding the agency's consideration of two petitions they had received that could require changes to existing awa regulations .

the first petition , received in 2013 , was from the physicians committee for responsible medicine .

the petition requests that aphis initiate rulemaking to add a definition of the term "alternatives" in order to define what a primary investigator at a facility using animals as research models is required to consider in lieu of a procedure that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to an animal .

the petition further requests that aphis amend the existing definition of "painful procedure" to codify long - standing aphis policy that a procedure should be considered painful if it may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animal .

aphis is currently considering public comments and supporting documents received by may 29 , 2015 .

the second petition , published may 1 , 2015 , concerns the social and psychological well - being of primates in captivity .

following a decision by the national institutes of health in 2013 to retire most of its chimpanzees used in biomedical research , and to house them in sanctuaries suitable to their natural social groups and behaviors , animal welfare activists turned their attention to the estimated 110,000 other primates in research laboratories .

these primates , like chimpanzees , are also highly social animals .

the new england anti - vivisection society filed a petition with aphis asking for specific rules on the care of all primates regarding their social and psychological well - being .

aphis took public comments until june 30 , 2015 , and is currently considering them .
