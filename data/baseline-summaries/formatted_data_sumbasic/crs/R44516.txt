the 115 th congress continues to take an interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .

the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites , shale gas extraction , and defenses against disease .

however , widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions about the prioritization of r&d , both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal r&d portfolio .

the u.s. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering r&d .

its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense , health , safety , the environment , and energy security ; advancing knowledge generally ; developing the scientific and engineering workforce ; and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .

most of the r&d funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies .

the federal r&d budget is an aggregation of the r&d components of each federal agency .

there is no single , centralized source of funds that is allocated to individual agencies .

agency r&d budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process and may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to r&d or in accounts that include funding for non - r&d activities .

these budgets are subjected to review , revision , and approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and become part of president obama's annual budget submission to congress .

the federal r&d budget is then calculated by aggregating the r&d components of each federal agency .

congress plays a central role in defining the nation's r&d priorities as it makes decisions about the level and allocation of r&d funding â€” overall , within agencies , and for specific programs .

some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the current federal deficit and debt .

as congress acted to complete the fy2017 appropriations process , it faced two overarching issues: the extent to which federal r&d investments could grow in the face of increased pressure on discretionary spending and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding .

budget caps may have limited overall r&d funding and may have required movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities .

moving funding between programs / accounts / agencies can be complex and difficult because the funding for different programs / accounts / agencies is often provided through different appropriations bills .

this report begins with a discussion of the overall level of president obama's fy2017 r&d request , followed by analyses of the r&d funding request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency r&d initiatives .

the report concludes with discussion and analysis of the r&d budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that , collectively , account for nearly 99% of total federal r&d funding .

selected terms associated with federal r&d funding are defined in the text box on the next page .

the appendix provides a list of acronyms and abbreviations .

on february 9 , 2016 , president obama released his proposed fy2017 budget .

this report provides government - wide , multiagency , and individual agency analyses of president obama's fy2017 request as it relates to r&d and related activities , as well as house and senate action on president obama's budget request through appropriations bills that provide funding for r&d and related activities .

for fy2017 , president obama's budget request included both discretionary and mandatory funding .

as presented in the "research and development" chapter of the analytical perspectives volume of the budget of the u.s. government fy2017 , the discretionary and mandatory funding are combined into a single figure for each agency .

in addition , a change in the department of energy's reporting of administrative expenses led to an increase in reporting of r&d investments "on the order of $2 to $3 billion a year. .

factors such as these can complicate the analysis of year - to - year changes in r&d funding , both in aggregate and for selected agencies .

for fy2017 , president obama proposed $152.333 billion for r&d , an increase of $6.195 billion ( 4.2% ) over the estimated fy2016 enacted r&d funding level of $146.138 billion .

adjusted for anticipated inflation of approximately 1.8% , president obama's fy2016 r&d request represented a constant dollar increase of 2.4% from the estimated fy2016 enacted level .

president obama's r&d request included continued funding of existing single - agency and multiagency programs and activities , as well as new initiatives .

single - agency initiatives are discussed in their respective sections of this report .

multiagency initiatives are discussed in the section " multiagency r&d initiatives . .

analysis of federal r&d funding is complicated by several factors , such as inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of r&d and the inclusion of r&d activities in accounts with non - r&d activities .

as a result , figures reported by omb and the white house office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , including those shown in table 1 , may differ from the agency budget analyses that appear later in this report .

federal r&d funding can be analyzed from a variety of perspectives that provide different insights .

the following sections examine the data by agency , by the character of the work supported , by a combination of these two perspectives , and by whether r&d is defense - related or not .

president obama's fy2017 budget request supported several multiagency r&d initiatives .

these initiatives are presented below in order of the size of the fy2017 budget requests .

the remainder of this report provides a more in - depth analysis of r&d in 12 federal departments and agencies that , in aggregate , receive nearly 99% of total federal r&d funding .

agencies are presented in order of the size of their r&d budgets , with the largest presented first .

annual appropriations for these agencies are provided through 9 of the 12 regular appropriations bills .

for each agency covered in this report , table 6 shows the corresponding regular appropriations bill that provides primary funding for the agency , including its r&d activities .

as of september 28 , 2016 , congress had not completed action on any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for fy2017 .

the house committee on appropriations had reported all nine of the regular appropriations bills that provide r&d funding , and the house had passed three of them .

the senate committee on appropriations had reported all nine of the regular appropriations bills that provide r&d funding , and the senate had passed three of them .

on december 10 , president obama signed into law the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-254 ) .

division a , further continuing appropriations act , 2017 , generally provides continuing appropriations for most federal agencies at 99.8% of fy2016 funding through april 28 , 2017 , subject to other provisions in the act , pending final action on the remaining 11 regular appropriations acts for fy2017 .

division b , security assistance appropriations act , 2017 , includes additional funding for dod rdt&e , designated by congress as overseas contingency operations / global war on terrorism funding .

on september 29 , 2016 , president obama signed into law the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , and zika response and preparedness act ( p.l .

114-223 ) .

this act , among other things , had provided continuing appropriations for most federal agencies through december 10 , 2016 , at about 99.5% of fy2016 funding .

on december 10 , 2016 , president obama signed into law the further continuing appropriations act , 2017 ( cr ; division a , p.l .

114-254 ) , providing continued funding for agencies through april 28 , 2017 , generally at the fy2016 level , less an across - the - board reduction of 0.1901% .

the act generally funded continuing projects and activities , under the same authority and conditions , and to the same extent and manner , as for fy2016 .

in may 2017 , congress passed and president trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) .

the act provides fy2017 funding for most federal agencies , except those already provided for in p.l .

114-223 .

where possible , r&d funding provided under this act is identified in the following sections of this report .

for some agencies , however , funding for r&d is included in appropriations line items that also include non - r&d activities ; therefore , it is not possible to identify precisely how much of the funding provided in appropriations laws is allocated to r&d specifically .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after departments and agencies allocate their appropriations to specific activities and report those figures .

in addition to this report , crs produces individual reports on each of the appropriations bills .

these reports can be accessed via the crs website at http: / / www.crs.gov / cli / clis ? cliid=73 .

also , the status of each appropriations bill is available on the crs web page , status table of appropriations , available at http: / / www.crs.gov / appropriationsstatustable / index .

because of the way that agencies report budget data to congress , it can be difficult to identify the portion that is r&d .

consequently , r&d data presented in the agency analyses in this report may differ from r&d data provided by omb .

funding for r&d is often included in appropriations line items that also include non - r&d activities ; therefore , it is not possible to identify precisely how much of the funding provided in appropriations laws is allocated to r&d specifically .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after departments and agencies allocate their appropriations to specific activities and report those figures .

congress supports r&d in the department of defense ( dod ) primarily through its research , development , test , and evaluation ( rdt&e ) appropriation .

the appropriation supports the development of the nation's future military hardware and software and the technology base upon which those products rely .

nearly all of what dod spends on rdt&e is appropriated in title iv of the defense appropriations bill .

 ( see table 7 . ) .

however , rdt&e funds are also appropriated in other parts of the bill .

for example , rdt&e funds are appropriated as part of the defense health program , chemical agents and munitions destruction program , and the national defense sealift fund .

the defense health program ( dhp ) supports the delivery of health care to dod personnel and their families .

dhp funds ( including the rdt&e funds ) are requested through the defensewide operations and maintenance appropriations request .

the program's rdt&e funds support congressionally directed research on breast , prostate , and ovarian cancer ; traumatic brain injuries ; orthotics and prosthetics ; and other medical conditions .

congress appropriates funds for this program in title vi ( other department of defense programs ) of the defense appropriations bill .

the chemical agents and munitions destruction program supports activities to destroy the u.s. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage .

funds for this program are requested through the defensewide procurement appropriations request .

congress appropriates funds for this program also in title vi .

the national defense sealift fund supports the procurement , operation and maintenance , and research and development of the nation's naval reserve fleet and supports a u.s. flagged merchant fleet that can serve in time of need .

the rdt&e funding for this effort is requested in the navy's procurement request and appropriated in title v ( revolving and management funds ) of the appropriation bill .

the joint improvised - threat defeat fund ( jidf , formerly the joint improvised explosive device defeat fund ) also contains rdt&e monies .

however , the fund does not contain an rdt&e line item as do the programs mentioned above .

the joint improvised - threat defeat organization ( jido ) , which administers the fund , tracks ( but does not report ) the amount of funding allocated to rdt&e .

jidf funding is not included in the table below .

rdt&e funds also have been requested and appropriated as part of dod's separate funding to support efforts in what the bush administration termed the global war on terror ( gwot ) , and what the obama administration refers to as overseas contingency operations ( oco ) .

typically , the rdt&e funds appropriated for gwot / oco activities go to specified program elements ( pes ) in title iv .

however , they are requested and accounted for separately .

the bush administration requested these funds in separate gwot emergency supplemental requests .

the obama administration , while continuing to identify these funds uniquely as oco requests , has included these funds as part of the regular budget , not in emergency supplementals .

however , the obama administration has asked for additional oco funds in supplemental requests , if the initial oco funding is not enough to get through the fiscal year .

the oco budget declined as operations in iraq and afghanistan were reduced .

in addition , gwot / oco - related requests / appropriations often include money for a number of transfer funds .

these have included in the past the iraqi freedom fund ( iff ) , the iraqi security forces fund , the afghanistan security forces fund , and the pakistan counterinsurgency capability fund .

congress typically makes a single appropriation into each of these funds and authorizes the secretary to make transfers to other accounts , including rdt&e , at his discretion .

these transfers are eventually reflected in title iv prior year funding figures .

for fy2017 , the obama administration requested $71.392 billion for dod's baseline title iv rdt&e .

this is $1.423 billion ( 2.2% ) above the enacted fy2016 level .

in addition to the baseline title iv rdt&e request , the administration requested $823 million in rdt&e through the defense health program and $389 million in rdt&e through the chemical agents and munitions destruction program for fy2017 .

president obama requested no rdt&e funding in fy2017 for the national defense sealift fund .

rdt&e funding can be analyzed in different ways .

each of the military departments request and receive their own rdt&e funding .

so , too , do various dod agencies ( eg , the missile defense agency and the defense advanced research projects agency ) , collectively aggregated within the defensewide account .

rdt&e funding also can be characterized by budget activity ( i.e. , the type of rdt&e supported ) .

those budget activities designated as 6.1 , 6.2 , and 6.3 ( basic research , applied research , and advanced technology development , respectively ) constitute what is called dod's science and technology program ( s&t ) and represent the more research - oriented part of the rdt&e program .

budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components ( eg , the joint strike fighter or missile defense systems ) , for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established .

budget activity 6.6 provides management support , including support for test and evaluation facilities .

budget activity 6.7 supports the development of system improvements in existing operational systems .

many congressional policymakers are particularly interested in s&t funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science .

some in the defense community see ensuring adequate support for s&t activities as imperative to maintaining u.s. military superiority into the future .

the knowledge generated at this stage of development may also contribute to advances in commercial technologies .

president obama's fy2017 request for title iv baseline s&t funding was $12.501 billion , $495 million below the fy2016 enacted baseline level ( $535 million below the fy2016 level including oco funding ) .

within the s&t program , basic research ( 6.1 ) receives special attention , particularly by the nation's universities .

dod is not a large supporter of basic research when compared to nih or nsf .

however , over half of dod's basic research budget is spent at universities , and it represents the major source of funds in some areas of science and technology ( such as electrical engineering and materials science ) .

the administration is requesting $2.102 billion for dod basic research for fy2017 .

this is $207 million ( 9.1% ) less than what was enacted for fy2016 .

on december 10 , president obama signed into law the further continuing and security assistance appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

114-254 ) .

division a , further continuing appropriations act , 2017 , generally provides continuing appropriations for most dod activities at 99.8% of fy2016 funding through april 28 , 2017 , subject to other provisions in the act , pending final action on the remaining 11 regular appropriations acts for fy2017 .

division b , security assistance appropriations act , 2017 , includes additional funding for dod rdt&e , designated by congress as gwot / oco funding .

this funding includes $78.7 million for army rdt&e and $3.0 million for defense - wide rdt&e , as well as $87.8 million for the joint improvised explosive device defeat fund , a portion of which may be used to support rdt&e .

on june 16 , 2016 , the house passed the department of defense appropriations act , 2017 ( h.r .

5293 ) .

the bill provides baseline funding and gwot / oco funding .

the house bill designates part of the oco funding as being intended to meet gwot / oco requirements and a portion to meet baseline requirements .

the house - passed bill would provide $70.293 billion in funding for baseline rdt&e , $325 million ( 0.5% ) more than the fy2016 baseline funding level and $1.099 billion ( 1.5% ) less than the fy2017 request .

the house â€“ passed bill would provide $497 million in gwot / oco funding for fy2017 , of which $163 million is intended to address baseline requirements .

the balance of gwot / oco funding , $334 million , is $103 million ( 44.4% ) more than the fy2016 gwot / oco funding level and $40 million ( 10.8% ) below the request .

the house - passed bill would provide $1.467 billion for rdt&e for the defense health program for fy2017 , $654 million ( 30.8% ) below the fy2016 level and $644 million ( 78.3% ) above the fy2017 request ; $389 million for rdt&e for chemical agents and munitions destruction for fy2017 , $190 million ( 32.9% ) below the fy2016 level and equal to the request ; and $3 million for rdt&e work of the inspector general for fy2017 , $1 million above the fy2016 level and equal to the request .

with respect to s&t funding ( budget activities 6.1-6.3 ) , the house - passed bill would provide essentially the same funding for fy2017 as the enacted fy2016 level and $529 million ( 4.2% ) more than the request .

on may 26 , 2016 , the senate committee on appropriations reported the department of defense appropriations act , 2017 ( s. 3000 ) .

like the house bill , s. 3000 provides both baseline funding and gwot / oco funding .

the senate - reported bill would provide $70.801 billion in funding for baseline rdt&e , $833 million more than the fy2016 baseline funding level , $591 million less than the request , and $508 million more than the house - passed bill .

the senate - reported bill would provide $374 million in gwot / oco funding for fy2017 , $143 million more than the fy2016 level and equal to the request .

the senate - reported bill includes: $1.730 billion for rdt&e for the defense health program for fy2017 , $391 million below the fy2016 level , $907 million above the request , and $263 million above the house - passed level ; $389 million for rdt&e for chemical agents and munitions destruction for fy2017 , $190 million below the fy2016 level , and equal to the request and house - passed levels ; and $3 million for rdt&e work of the inspector general for fy2017 , $1 million above the fy2016 level and equal to the request and house - passed levels .

with respect to s&t funding ( budget activities 6.1-6.3 ) , the senate - reported bill would provide $13.364 billion , $328 million above the fy2016 level , $863 million above the request , and $335 million above the house - passed level .

in early may 2017 , congress passed and president donald trump signed the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , which provides funding for the department of defense for fy2017 , among other things .

the act provides both baseline funding and gwot / oco funding .

the act provides $72.302 billion in baseline title iv rdt&e funding for fy2017 , an increase of $2.334 billion ( 3.3% ) above the fy2016 enacted level .

for fy2017 , the act also $2.102 billion in rdt&e funding for the defense health program , down $19 million ( 0.9% ) from the fy2016 funding level , and $389 million in rdt&e funding for chemical agents and munitions destruction , a decrease of $190 million ( 32.8% ) from the fy2016 funding level .

in addition , the act provides $1.397 billion of oco / gwot rdt&e funding for fy2017 , up $1.166 billion ( 504.8% ) from the fy2016 funding level .

fy2017 funding for the s&t portion of title iv rdt&e ( baseline and oco / gwot ) is $14.029 billion , an increase of $953 million ( 7.3% ) from the fy2016 funding level .

the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is the federal government's "principal agency for protecting the health of all americans and providing essential human services , especially for those who are least able to help themselves. .

this section focuses on hhs r&d funded through the national institutes of health , an hhs agency which accounts for more than 95% of total hhs r&d funding .

other hhs agencies that provide funding for r&d include the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , the agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , and the administration for children and families ( acf ) .

the department of energy ( doe ) was established in 1977 by the department of energy organization act ( p.l .

95-91 ) , which combined energy - related programs from a variety of agencies with defense - related nuclear programs that dated back to the manhattan project .

today , doe conducts basic scientific research in fields ranging from nuclear physics to the biological and environmental sciences ; basic and applied r&d relating to energy production and use ; and r&d on nuclear weapons , nuclear nonproliferation , and defense nuclear reactors .

the department has a system of 17 national laboratories around the country , mostly operated by contractors , that together account for about 40% of all doe expenditures .

the administration requested $14.705 billion for fy2017 for doe r&d and related activities , including programs in three broad categories: science , national security , and energy .

this request was 14.4% more than the enacted fy2016 amount of $12.858 billion .

unusually , $750 million of the request was for mandatory funding .

considering only discretionary funding , the request was $13.955 billion , an increase of 8.5% .

the house bill ( h.r .

5055 as reported by the house committee on appropriations , with h.rept .

114-532 ) would have provided $12.857 billion .

the senate bill ( h.r .

2028 as passed by the senate , with s.rept .

114-236 ) would have provided $13.007 billion .

neither bill would have included any mandatory funding .

the final appropriation was $13.140 billion , all of it discretionary .

 ( see table 9 for details. ) .

the request for the doe office of science was $5.672 billion , an increase of 6.1% from the fy2016 appropriation of $5.347 billion .

the request included $100 million in mandatory funding for a program of grants to universities .

without this mandatory funding , the request for discretionary appropriations was $5.572 billion , an increase of 4.2% .

the house and senate bills would each have provided $5.400 billion .

the final appropriation was $5.392 billion .

there is no authorized funding level for the office of science for fy2017 .

the most recent authorization act ( the america competes reauthorization act of 2010 , p.l .

111-358 ) authorized appropriations through fy2013 .

the office of science includes six major research programs .

the request for the largest program , basic energy sciences ( bes ) , was $1.937 billion , an increase of 4.8% .

within bes , a requested increase of $33 million for energy frontier research centers was to support five new awards for centers in the field of subsurface geochemistry and geophysics .

a new activity in computational chemical sciences was to receive $14 million .

funding for the continued construction of the linac coherent light source ii ( lcls - ii ) was to decrease by $10 million , in line with the previously projected construction schedule .

the house bill would have provided $1.860 billion , and the house committee report "strongly caution[ed] the department against assuming an ever - increasing budget when planning the balance among facility runtime , construction , and research funding. .

the senate bill would have provided $1.913 billion .

the final appropriation was $1.872 billion .

the request for high energy physics was $818 million , an increase of 2.9% .

construction funding for the long baseline neutrino facility / deep underground neutrino experiment ( lbnf / dune ) was to increase by $19 million .

following a review in july 2015 , doe approved a revised conceptual design for lbnf / dune in november 2015 .

the projected total project cost range is now $1.260 billion to $1.860 billion , up from the range of $805 million to $1.110 billion reported in fy2016 budget documents .

the projected start of operations has slipped from fy2027 to fy2030 .

the house bill would have provided $823 million , including $5 million more than the request for lbnf .

the senate bill would have provided $833 million , including $10 million more than the request for lbnf .

both the house and senate committee reports expressed "strong support" for the strategic planning recommendations of the particle physics project prioritization panel .

the final appropriation was $825 million .

the request for biological and environmental research ( ber ) was $662 million , an increase of 8.7% .

this program consists of two roughly equal parts: biological systems science and climate and environmental sciences .

in the biological systems science program , funding for genomic science was to increase by $43 million .

funding for radiological sciences was to be eliminated .

in climate and environmental sciences , funding for climate and earth system modeling was to increase by $5 million .

the house bill would have provided $595 million .

the senate bill would have provided $637 million .

the final appropriation was $612 million .

the house and senate committee reports and the final explanatory statement all directed doe to give priority to optimizing the operation of ber user facilities .

the request for nuclear physics was $636 million , an increase of 3.1% .

the proposed increase was spread across most areas of research and operations .

no additional funding was requested for construction of the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) upgrade because that project was expected to move from the construction phase in fy2016 to the commissioning phase in fy2017 .

the house bill would have provided $620 million .

the senate bill would have provided $636 million .

the final appropriation was $622 million .

the request for advanced scientific computing research ( ascr ) was $663 million , an increase of 6.8% .

a new exascale computing program ( part of the doe - wide exascale computing initiative ) was to receive $154 million .

according to doe , this program would consolidate ongoing activities currently funded through other ascr programs , and the requested funding would represent a net decrease of $4 million for those activities .

proposed decreases in other ascr programs mostly reflected activities transferred to the new program .

the house bill would have provided $621 million , including $151 million for exascale computing .

the senate bill would have provided $656 million , including the requested $154 million for exascale computing .

the final appropriation was $647 million , including $164 million for the exascale initiative .

the request for fusion energy sciences was $398 million , a decrease of 9.1% .

funding for most elements of the program was to decrease , but funding for u.s. contributions to the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor ( iter ) was to increase to $125 million from $115 million in fy2016 .

the house bill would have provided $450 million , including the requested amount for iter .

the senate bill would have provided $280 million , including no funds for iter .

the senate committee report explained this decision by stating that iter funding "continues to crowd out other federal science investments , including domestic fusion research. .

the final appropriation was $380 million , including $50 million for iter and reprogramming authority to allocate up to an additional $50 million to iter .

the cost of u.s. participation in iter â€” and especially its impact on the availability of funding for the rest of the fusion program â€” has long been controversial .

project delays , design and scope changes , and other factors have delayed formal approval of a revised cost and schedule estimate .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l .

114-113 ) required that not later than may 2 , 2016 , the secretary of energy shall submit to the committees on appropriations of both houses of congress a report recommending either that the united states remain a partner in the iter project after october 2017 or terminate participation , which shall include , as applicable , an estimate of either the full cost , by fiscal year , of all future federal funding requirements for construction , operation , and maintenance of iter or the cost of termination .

submitted in late may 2016 , the doe report recommended continued u.s. partnership in iter through fy2018 and a reevaluation of u.s. participation prior to submittal of the fy2019 budget .

the house committee report directed doe to submit a follow - up report by december 1 , 2016 .

the final explanatory statement directed doe to hold additional workshops and report to congress on the fusion energy science community's continued long - term planning efforts .

the request for doe national security r&d was $3.702 billion , a 1.8% increase from $3.636 billion in fy2016 .

in the weapons activities account , a proposed decrease of $53 million for component manufacturing development was more than offset by proposed increases in other areas , the largest being an increase of $40 million for advanced simulation and computing .

in the naval reactors program , a proposed overall increase of $45 million included an increase of $27 million for development of replacement reactor systems for ohio class submarines .

funding for defense nuclear nonproliferation r&d was to decrease by $25 million .

the house bill would have provided $3.753 billion for national security r&d , including $97 million more than the request for defense nuclear nonproliferation r&d , for development and demonstration activities to reduce the use of highly enriched uranium in high - performance research reactors and molybdenum - 99 production .

the senate bill would have provided $3.631 billion , including $68 million less than the request for naval reactors operations and infrastructure .

the final appropriation of $3.760 billion included $53 million for the development of new fuels for high - performance research reactors and the requested amount for the naval reactors program .

the fy2017 request for doe energy r&d was $5.332 billion , up 37.6% from $3.875 billion in fy2016 .

the requested total included $650 million in mandatory funding .

considering only discretionary funding , the request was $4.442 billion , an increase of 14.6% .

discretionary funding for r&d on energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) was to increase by 42.6% , with increases requested for all major eere programs .

within eere , the largest requested increases were for vehicle technologies ( $469 million , up from $310 million ) and a new crosscutting innovation initiatives program ( $215 million ) .

the latter was to support new regional and small business partnerships , business accelerators that leverage the capabilities of the national laboratories , and funding opportunities for "off - roadmap" r&d projects .

the request for $500 million in mandatory funding for eere was to support r&d on clean transportation , biofuels , and smart mobility .

discretionary funding for the advanced research projects agency â€“ energy ( arpa - e ) was to increase by 20.3% .

the request proposed to maintain a 60:40 split between arpa - e project funding in the areas of stationary power systems and transportation systems .

a proposed five - year arpa - e trust was to provide $150 million in mandatory funding in fy2017 , rising to $650 million in fy2021 , with the goal of reaching total arpa - e funding of $1 billion per year .

in the fossil energy program , the request included an increase for natural gas technologies , mostly directed toward carbon capture , from $43 million in fy2016 to $58 million in fy2017 .

the house bill would have provided $3.704 billion for energy r&d .

the senate bill would have provided $3.977 billion .

for eere , both bills would have provided less than the fy2016 amount ( and much less than the requested amount ) .

both would have provided a smaller than requested increase for arpa - e , and more than the request for fossil energy r&d overall .

for natural gas technologies , the house bill would have provided $25 million , while the senate bill would have provided $46 million .

the final appropriation was $3.988 billion , including slightly more than the fy2016 amount for eere ( but much less than the request ) , the house amount for arpa - e , more than either the house or senate bill for fossil energy r&d overall , and $43 million for natural gas technologies .

the national aeronautics and space administration was created in 1958 by the national aeronautics and space act ( p.l .

85-568 ) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities .

nasa has research programs in planetary science , earth science , heliophysics , astrophysics , and aeronautics , as well as development programs for future human spacecraft and for multipurpose space technology such as advanced propulsion systems .

in addition , nasa operates the international space station as a facility for r&d and other purposes .

the administration requested $15.890 billion for nasa r&d in fy2017 .

this amount was 2.4% less than the fy2016 level of about $16.282 billion .

unusually , the fy2017 request included $763 million in mandatory funds .

the house bill ( h.r .

5393 as reported ) would have provided about $16.483 billion .

the senate bill ( s. 2837 ) would have provided about $16.274 billion .

neither bill would have provided any mandatory funds .

the final appropriation provided about $16.657 billion .

for a breakdown of these amounts , see table 10 .

nasa r&d funding comes through five accounts: science , aeronautics , space technology , exploration , and the international space station and commercial crew portions of space operations .

the fy2017 request for science was $5.601 billion , an increase of 0.3% .

within this total , funding for earth science , astrophysics , and heliophysics were to increase , while funding for planetary science and the james webb space telescope were to decrease .

the house bill would have provided $4 million less than the request , while the senate bill would have provided $206 million less .

relative to the request , the house bill would have shifted more than $300 million from earth science to planetary science .

in contrast , most of the senate bill's decrease would have been in planetary science .

the final appropriation was $5.765 billion .

it included the house bill's level of funding for planetary science , but with less reduction for earth science .

within earth science , the request included $131 million ( up from $100 million in fy2016 ) for the landsat - 9 land imaging satellite .

launch is anticipated "as early as" 2021 .

nasa previously proposed the thermal infrared free flyer , a lower - cost satellite intended to reduce the risk of a gap in data availability prior to the launch of landsat - 9 .

congress rejected funding for the thermal infrared free flyer in the fy2016 appropriations cycle , and the mission was not included in the fy2017 request .

the house report directed nasa to prioritize funds for landsat - 9 and to evaluate commercially available data in the event of a data gap in the landsat program .

the senate report recommended the requested amount for landsat - 9 and directed nasa to provide a plan detailing the technical and schedule progress needed for a 2020 launch date .

the final explanatory statement also included the requested amount .

within planetary science , the request included $50 million ( down from $175 million in fy2016 ) for a mission to jupiter's moon europa .

although a mission to europa was a high priority of the 2011 national research council ( nrc ) decadal survey of planetary science , the nrc expressed reservations about its anticipated cost .

for several years , congress has appropriated more for formulation of a europa mission than nasa has requested .

as directed by the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , nasa's fy2017 congressional budget justification included a five - year estimate of the funding required assuming a 2022 launch .

the justification stated that "the notional outyear profile in the budget may support a launch as early as the late 2020s , assuming the mission concept and scope remain stable... .

acceleration of the launch to 2022 is not recommended , given potential impacts to the rest of the science portfolio. .

the house report recommended at least $260 million for europa orbiter and lander missions , with the orbiter launch no later than 2022 and the lander launch no later than 2024 .

the senate report called for "an expeditious launch and reduced travel time" in order to maximize the scientific return of a europa mission , but it did not specify a funding level or a launch date .

it directed nasa to provide a report on options for the mission "to assist the committee in evaluating potential mission configurations. .

the final explanatory statement provided $275 million "as outlined by the house" and explicitly omitted the senate language regarding an analysis of options .

the fy2017 request for aeronautics was $790 million , an increase of 24.7% from fy2016 .

the request included new aviation horizons ( nah ) , a new initiative of experimental aircraft and systems demonstrations .

nah projects on subsonic aircraft were to receive $100 million in mandatory funding from the proposed 21 st century clean transportation plan .

an additional $56 million in mandatory funding was to fund a low - boom supersonic flight demonstrator .

the house bill would have provided $78 million less than the request for aeronautics , while the senate bill would have provided $189 million less .

the house committee's recommendation included $61 million ( of discretionary funds ) for a low - boom demonstrator .

the house and senate committee reports both directed nasa to work with the federal aviation administration on research related to the integration of unmanned aerial systems in the national airspace system .

the final appropriation was $660 million .

the explanatory statement did not mention the low - boom flight demonstrator ; it supported the house language on unmanned aerial systems .

the fy2017 request for space technology was $827 million , an increase of 20.4% from fy2016 .

space technology was first established as a separate account in fy2011 .

each year since then , the administration has proposed to increase space technology funding .

congress has provided increases each year except fy2014 , but always less than the administration's request .

proposed mandatory funding of $136 million accounted for almost all of the requested increase in fy2017 .

the bulk of the mandatory funding was to support technology demonstration missions , including the restore - l satellite servicing mission for which congress appropriated $133 million in fy2016 .

the house bill would have provided $88 million less than the request for space technology , or $48 million more than the fy2016 appropriation , while the senate bill would have provided the fy2016 amount .

the senate committee report recommended $130 million ( of discretionary funds ) for restore - l .

the house and senate committee reports both identified nuclear propulsion research and a small launch technology demonstration platform as funding priorities .

the final appropriation for space technology was the fy2016 amount .

within this total , the explanatory statement allocated funding for both nuclear propulsion and small launch capabilities .

it did not mention restore - l .

the fy2017 request for exploration was $3.337 billion , a decrease of 16.5% from fy2016 .

the exploration account primarily funds development of the orion multipurpose crew vehicle and the space launch system ( sls ) heavy - lift rocket , the capsule and launch vehicle mandated by the nasa authorization act of 2010 for future human exploration beyond earth orbit .

the account previously also funded development of a commercial crew transportation capability for u.s. astronaut access to the international space station ( iss ) , but congress transferred this activity to space operations in fy2016 .

within exploration , the fy2017 request for orion , the sls , and related ground systems ( known collectively as exploration systems development ) was $2.860 billion , a decrease of 21.5% from fy2016 .

the bulk of the proposed reduction was for sls launch vehicle development , which was to receive $1.263 billion , down 34.3% from $1.922 billion in fy2016 .

at the time of the fy2017 budget release , nasa was targeting a first test flight of sls carrying orion but no crew ( known as em - 1 ) in november 2018 ; that schedule has since slipped to 2019 .

the launch readiness date for the first flight of orion and the sls with a crew on board ( known as em - 2 ) continues to be fy2023 .

the house and senate bills would have provided $4.183 billion and $4.330 billion , respectively , for exploration .

these increases relative to the request would have funded the sls at the fy2016 level ( in the house bill ) or higher ( in the senate bill ) .

the house and senate reports both recommended funding for development of the sls exploration upper stage ( eus ) â€” $250 million and $300 million , respectively â€” which was not included in the administration request .

the house report specified that none of the funds in the house bill were for the asteroid redirect mission , which was proposed in the fy2014 budget but faced ongoing opposition in congress .

the final appropriation for exploration was $3.324 billion .

the explanatory statement directed nasa to continue developing certain technologies associated with the asteroid redirect mission , but also directed that these activities "should not distract from the overarching goal of sending humans to mars. .

in the space operations account , the request for the iss was $1.431 billion , a decrease of 0.4% from fy2016 , and the request for commercial crew was $1.185 billion , a decrease of 4.7% .

the fy2017 budget was the first to request commercial crew funding within space operations .

commercial crew is now part of the space transportation budget item , which also includes the cost of u.s. commercial cargo flights to the iss and payments to russia for soyuz flights carrying iss crews .

the house and senate bills would have provided $186 million less and $125 million less , respectively , than the request for space operations .

for the most part , the committee reports did not specify how the recommended funding should be allocated .

however , the senate report did note that its total included $1.185 billion for commercial crew , the same as the request .

the enacted bill provided the same amount as the senate for space operations overall and for commercial crew , again without specifying funding for the iss .

the national science foundation ( nsf ) supports basic research and education in the non - medical sciences and engineering .

congress established the foundation as an independent federal agency in 1950 and directed it to "promote the progress of science ; to advance the national health , prosperity , and welfare ; to secure the national defense ; and for other purposes. .

the nsf is a primary source of federal support for u.s. university research , especially in mathematics and computer science .

it is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) education program portfolio and federal stem student aid and support .

nsf has six major appropriations accounts: research and related activities ( rra , the main research account ) , education and human resources ( ehr , the main education account ) , major research equipment and facilities construction ( mrefc ) , agency operations and award management ( aoam ) , the national science board ( nsb ) , and the office of inspector general ( oig ) .

fy2016 and fy2017 funding for these accounts are tracked in table 11 .

overall .

the obama administration requested $7.964 billion for the nsf in fy2017 , a $501 million ( 6.7% ) increase over the fy2016 estimate of $7.463 billion .

this request included $7.564 billion in discretionary budget authority and $400 million in new one - time mandatory budget authority ( excluding new mandatory funding , the total nsf request is $101 million [1.3%] greater than the fy2016 appropriation ) .

the request would have increased budget authority in three accounts relative to the fy2016 estimate: rra by $392 million ( 6.5% ) , ehr by $73 million ( 8.3% ) , and aoam by $43 million ( 13% ) .

the request would have provided nsb and oig accounts with about the same amount as in fy2016 and decreased funding for the mrefc account by $7 million ( 3.6% ) .

as reported by the senate , s. 2837 would have provided a total of $7.510 billion to nsf for fy2017 , which is $46 million ( 0.6% ) above the fy2016 estimate and $54 million ( 0.7% ) below the fy2017 discretionary request .

as reported by the house , h.r .

5393 would have provided a total of $7.406 billion to nsf for fy2017 , which is $57 million ( 0.8% ) below the fy2016 estimate , and $158 million ( 2.1% ) below the fy2017 discretionary request .

neither bill would have provided mandatory funding .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ) , signed by the president on may 5 , 2017 , provides $7.472 billion in discretionary funding to nsf , 0.1% above the fy2016 enacted amount .

the increase of nearly $9 million for nsf is provided entirely within the mrefc account .

the fy2017 nsf budget justification identifies two areas of major emphasis , four cross - foundation investments , and six ongoing nsf - wide priorities .

the two areas of major emphasis are clean energy r&d and strengthening support for core activities .

the fy2017 request would have increased funding for clean energy r&d by $141 million to $512 million ( 37.9% ) .

strengthening support for core services would have been funded by new mandatory budget authority of $400 million .

nsf identifies four cross - foundation activities that aim to bring researchers from different fields of science and engineering together to address cross disciplinary questions .

these activities are understanding the brain ( utb , $142 million requested , 3.6% decrease ) ; risk and resilience ( $43Â million requested , 4.9% increase ) ; innovations at the nexus of food , energy , and water systems ( infews , $62 million requested , 27.7% increase ) ; and nsf inclusion across the nation of communities of learners of underrepresented discoverers in engineering and science ( nsf includes , $16 million requested , 3.2% increase ) .

nsf identifies six foundation - wide priorities for fy2017 .

these are cyber - enabled materials , manufacturing , and smart systems ( cemmss , $257 million requested , 0.3% increase ) ; cyberinfrastructure framework for 21 st century science , engineering , and education ( cif21 , $100 million requested , 24.4% decrease ) ; innovation corps ( i - corps , $30 million requested , no change ) ; research at the interface of biological , mathematical , and physical sciences ( biomaps , $30 million requested , 4.8% decrease ) ; science , engineering , and education for sustainability ( sees , $52 million requested , 29.8% decrease ) ; and secure and trustworthy cyberspace ( satc , $150 million requested , 15.4% increase ) .

the report to accompany s. 2837 , s.rept .

114-239 ( senate report ) , expressed support for the i - corps program but did not specify a funding level .

the report to accompany h.r .

5393 , h.rept .

114-605 ( house report ) , recommended $5 million above the requested level for the program .

the explanatory statement accompanying p.l .

115-31 directs nsf to provide $30.0 million for i - corps .

research .

the obama administration sought a $392 million ( 6.5% ) increase in funding for rra in fy2017 , for a total of $6.425 billion .

of this total , the request included $6.079 billion as discretionary funding and $346 million as new mandatory budget authority .

the fy2017 request included increases for all of the rra subaccounts except for the u.s. arctic research commission ( usarc ) , which would not have changed .

the largest percentage increase would have gone to engineering ( eng , 9.4% ) .

the largest increase in dollars would have gone to mathematical and physical sciences ( mps , $87.3 million ) .

the other subaccounts would have received increases between 6.0% and 6.5% , except for international and integrative activities ( iia ) , which would have received a 2.9% increase .

the fy2017 request included an increase for the widely tracked rra program experimental program to stimulate competitive research ( epscor ) from $160 million to $171 million ( 6.7% ) , of which $8.56 million was requested as new mandatory funding .

the explanatory statement accompanying p.l .

115-31 specifies no less than $160 million for epscor .

in recent years , policymakers have actively debated congressional funding directives at the major subaccount level within rra .

some analysts assert that legislators have a role in establishing funding priorities by scientific field within rra , as part of the legislative oversight function and in order to assure accountability for taxpayer funds .

other analysts argue that the scientists who manage nsf ought to determine the distribution of funding by field , based on their deeper knowledge of research needs and scientific possibilities within each field , and of how these needs are best balanced across the nsf portfolio .

for fy2016 , p.l .

114-113 did not specify the funding distribution within rra , except to limit the budget authority for social , behavioral and economic sciences to its fy2015 level .

for fy2017 , s. 2837 and h.r .

5393 did not specify allocations within rra , though the accompanying reports specified funding amounts for a subset of programs .

similarly , the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 , which provides $6.033 billion overall for rra , does not specify allocations at the rra subaccount level but does specify that $544 million remain available for polar research and operations support , including activities for the u.s. antarctic program .

education .

the fy2017 request included a $73 million ( 8.3% ) increase for ehr , for a total of $953 million .

of that total , $54 million was requested as mandatory budget authority .

as reported by the senate and house committees on appropriations , both s. 2837 and h.r .

5393 would have kept ehr funding at the fy2016 enacted level of $880 million .

similarly , p.l .

115-31 provides $880 million in discretionary funding with no mandatory funding .

by program , the largest increase in the fy2017 ehr request was for ehr core research ( ecr ) : stem learning , within the division of research on learning in formal and informal settings .

the fy2017 request for ecr: stem learning was $52 million , or double the fy2016 estimate of $26 million .

congress did not fund a similar requested increase for fy2016 .

ehr programs that are widely tracked by congressional policymakers include the graduate research fellowship ( grf ) and national research traineeship ( nrt ) .

the fy2017 request for grf was $332 million , which was essentially the same as the fy2016 estimate .

grf funding would have been split equally between rra and ehr , which would each have contributed $166 million .

the fy2017 request for nrt was $59 million , a $4 million ( 8.3% ) increase from fy2016 .

funding for the nrt would have been split between ehr and rra , but not equally .

the rra contribution would have been $21 million , $2 million below the fy2016 estimate .

the ehr contribution would have been $35 million , $6 million above the fy2016 estimate .

other widely tracked ehr programs include advanced technological education ( $66 million requested , no change ) ; robert noyce teacher scholarship program ( $61 million requested , no change ) ; cybercorps: scholarships for service ( $70 million requested , 40.0% increase ) ; advancing informal stem learning ( aisl , $63 million requested , no change in total but $8 million was requested as mandatory funding ) ; science , technology , engineering , and mathematics + computing partnerships ( stem+c , $52 million requested , no change in total but $31 million was requested as mandatory funding ) ; historically black colleges and universities undergraduate program ( hbcu - up , $35 million requested , no change ) ; tribal colleges and university programs ( $14 million requested , no change ) ; and the louis stokes alliance for minority participation ( $46 million requested , no change ) .

the senate report recommended $55 million for the cybercorps program ( 10% increase ) ; the house report did not specify an amount .

the senate and house reports additionally recommended $5 million and $30 million , respectively , for broadening participation in stem fields at hispanic serving institutions ( hsis ) .

the explanatory statement accompanying p.l .

115-31 directs nsf to provide funding levels for numerous programs at the requested levels , including the hbcu program , stem+c partnerships , tribal colleges and university programs , and aisl .

for the cybercorps:scholarships for service program , the explanatory statement specifies $55 million , which is $15 million below the nsf requested amount , equal to the senate report recommendation , and 10% above the fy2016 funding level for that program .

further , though nsf reports ~$226.3 million in investments to hsis in fy2015 through various agency programs , the explanatory statement directs nsf to establish a specific hsi program at no less than $15 million and encourages the foundation to "use this program to build capacity at institutions of higher education that typically do not receive high levels of nsf grant funding. .

construction .

other accounts that fund r&d at nsf include the mrefc account , which supports large construction projects and scientific instruments .

the obama administration sought just over $193 million for mrefc in fy2017 , $7 million less than the fy2016 estimate .

in fy2017 , mrefc funding would have supported continued construction of the large synoptic survey telescope ( $67 million requested , 32.7% decrease ) and daniel k. inouye solar telescope ( $20 million requested , no change ) .

most of this request ( $106 million ) would have funded the regional class research vessels ( rcrv ) program to build two ships to support science in u.s. coastal waters .

the senate report recommended increasing mrefc funding to $247 million ( $54 million above the request ) , including $159 million to build three ships for the rcrv program .

in contrast , the house report recommended decreasing funding to $87 million ( $106 million below the request ) and did not discuss the rcrv program .

the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 , provides $209 million , 4.3% more than the fy2016 estimate .

the accompanying explanatory statement directs nsf to provide $122 million to build three rcrvs .

this amounts to $41 million per ship , compared to the fy2017 request of $53 million per ship .

historically , the mrefc account has typically supported between four and six projects at a time .

the fy2015-fy2017 requests for three projects were lower than the historical trend , which could indicate that some potentially scientifically valuable projects have been delayed or overlooked .

on the other hand , when these large projects come online their operations costs must be shouldered by research accounts .

for example , nsf requested $65 million to operate and maintain a mrefc project that received its final construction funding in fy2016 , the national ecological observatory network ( neon ) .

this represented 8.2% of the fy2017 rra biological sciences ( bio ) request .

in a constrained budget environment , this dynamic could precipitate difficult choices between funding for research and funding for research facilities and equipment .

other accounts and initiatives .

the obama administration sought $373 million for aoam , a $43 million ( 13.0% ) increase .

a multi - year plan to relocate nsf headquarters accounts for the majority of this increase .

funding for nsb ( $4 million ) and oig ( $15 million ) would not have changed significantly between fy2016 and fy2017 under the request .

in line with the recommendations from the house and senate reports , p.l .

115-31 provides approximately the same levels as in fy2016 for these accounts: $330 million for aoam ( including $41 million for relocating the nsf headquarters ) , $4 million for nsb , and $15 million for oig .

the fy2017 nsf budget request included funding for three multiagency initiatives .

the national nanotechnology initiative would have received $415 million , about the same as in fy2016 .

the networking and information technology research and development would have received $1.254 billion , an increase of $59 million ( 4.9% ) .

most of this increase ( $56 million ) was requested as mandatory budget authority .

the u.s .

global change research program would have received $348 million , $9 million ( 2.6% ) more than the fy2016 estimate .

the house and senate reports did not include recommendations for these initiatives , nor does p.l .

115-31 specify funding for them .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) was created in 1862 in part to support agricultural research in an expanding , agriculturally dependent country .

usda conducts intramural research at federal facilities with government - employed scientists , and supports external research at universities and other facilities through competitive grants and formula - based funding .

the breadth of contemporary usda research spans traditional agricultural production techniques , organic and sustainable agriculture , bioenergy , nutrition needs and composition , food safety , animal and plant health , pest and disease management , economic decisionmaking , and other social sciences affecting consumers , farmers , and rural communities .

four agencies carry out usda's research and education activities , grouped together into the research , education , and economics ( ree ) mission area .

the agencies are the agricultural research service ( ars ) , national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) , national agricultural statistics service ( nass ) , and economic research service ( ers ) .

for fy2017 , the enacted agriculture appropriation is in the consolidated appropriations act , p.l .

115-31 .

both the house and the senate appropriations committees reported their agriculture appropriations bills ( h.r .

5054 , s. 2956 ) in april and may 2016 .

in addition to discretionary appropriations , agricultural research is also funded by state matching contributions and private donations or grants , as well as mandatory funding from the farm bill .

the enacted fy2017 appropriation provides $2.891 billion for agricultural research , down $45 million from the enacted fy2016 total ( - 1.5% ) .

this overall change is comprised of $67 million more for research programming across the four agencies , and $112 million less for buildings and facilities than in fy2016 .

the enacted bill is less of a reduction than either the house or senate bills , generally providing more to research programs than the house bill proposed , and reducing building and facilities by less than the senate bill proposed .

 ( see table 12 . ) .

two agencies of the department of commerce have major r&d programs: the national institute of standards and technology and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration .

the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates programs to provide america's veterans with medical care , benefits , social support , and memorials .

va provides a broad range of primary care , specialized care , and related medical and social support services .

va seeks to advance medical r&d in areas that most directly address the diseases and conditions that affect veterans and eligible beneficiaries .

funding for va r&d is generally included in line items that also include non - r&d funding .

therefore it is not possible to know precisely how much of the funding provided for in appropriations legislation will be allocated to r&d unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after the va allocates its appropriations to specific activities and reports those figures .

president obama proposed $1.252 billion for va r&d in fy2017 , up $32 million ( 2.6% ) from fy2016 .

the va request for fy2017 included $663 million for its medical and prosthetic research account , up $32.6 million ( 5.2% ) , and $589 million in funding for research supported by its medical services account , equal to its fy2016 funding .

the va's medical and prosthetics research is managed by the veterans health administration's office of research and development , which consists of four main research services: biomedical laboratory r&d supports preclinical research to understand life processes at the molecular , genomic , and physiological levels .

clinical science r&d administers investigations , including human subject research , to determine the feasibility or effectiveness of new treatments such as drugs , therapy , or devices .

health services r&d supports studies to identify and promote effective and efficient strategies to improve the organization , cost - effectiveness , and delivery of quality health care .

rehabilitation r&d develops novel approaches to restore full and productive lives to veterans with traumatic amputation , central nervous system injuries , loss of sight or hearing , or other physical and cognitive impairments .

each service oversees a number of research centers of excellence and is headed by a director .

these directors report to the chief research and development officer , who in turn reports to the deputy under secretary for health for policy and services .

the house - passed military construction and veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 ( h.r .

4974 ) would have fully funded the medical and prosthetic research request at $663 million , $33 million ( 5% ) more than the fy2016 enacted level of $631 million .

division b ( military construction , the department of veterans affairs , and related agencies ) of the military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 ( h.r .

2577 ) , as passed by the senate , included $675.4 million for the medical and prosthetic research account , $45 million ( 7% ) more than the fy2016 enacted level and $12 million ( 2% ) more than the house - passed level .

on june 23 , 2016 , the house approved the conference report on h.r .

2577 ( h.rept .

114-640 ) .

the bill would have provided $675.4 million in fy2017 funding for the medical and prosthetic research account .

on september 28 , 2016 , the house and senate passed the continuing appropriations and military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , and zika response and preparedness act ( p.l .

114-223 ) .

on september 29 , 2016 , president obama signed the bill into law .

division a of the act , designated as the military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations act , 2017 , provides funding for the department of veterans affairs , including $675.4 million for the medical and prosthetic research account .

table 15 summarizes r&d program funding for va , in the medical and prosthetic research account and medical services account .

table 16 provides amounts to be spent in designated research areas ( dras ) which va describes as "areas of particular importance to our veteran patient population. .

funding for research projects that span multiple areas may be included in several dras ; thus , the amounts in table 16 total to more than the appropriation or request for the va medical and prosthetic research account .

the department of the interior ( doi ) was created to protect and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage and to provide scientific and other information about those resources .

doi's responsibilities include , among other things , mapping , geological , hydrological , and biological science ; migratory bird and wildlife conservation ; endangered species preservation ; surface - mined lands protection and restoration ; and historic preservation .

president obama requested $1.048 billion in doi r&d funding for fy2017 , $84.5 million ( 8.8% ) above its fy2016 enacted level of $963.5 million .

according to doi , activities supported include scientific analysis of natural systems and applied field research to address specific problems , such as thawing permafrost , invasive species , and flooding .

the department's scientific research is used by land managers , for example , to support conservation efforts on the front lines of a changing climate and to confront the unpredictable nature of its impacts .

of president obama's fy2017 doi r&d funding request , 5.7% was for basic research , 79.0% was for applied research , and 15.4% was for development .

the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) is the only doi component that conducts basic research .

funding for doi r&d is generally included in appropriations line items that also include non - r&d activities ; therefore , it is not possible to identify precisely how much of the funding provided in appropriations legislation is allocated to r&d specifically unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after doi components allocate their appropriations to specific activities and report those figures .

the house passed h.r .

5538 , the department of the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations act for fy2017 on july 14 , 2016 .

the senate committee on appropriations reported its version of the act , s. 3068 , on june 16 , 2016 .

on may 5 , 2017 , president trump signed into law p.l .

115-31 , providing fy2017 funding for the department of the interior and other departments and agencies .

the department of transportation ( dot ) seeks to ensure a fast , safe , efficient , accessible , and convenient transportation system .

dot's goals include improving public health and safety by reducing transportation - related fatalities and injuries ; ensuring that the united states maintains critical transportation infrastructure in a state of good repair ; promoting transportation policies and investments that bring lasting and equitable economic benefits ; fostering livable communities by integrating transportation policies , plans , and investments with housing and economic development policies ; and advancing environmentally sustainable policies and investments that reduce carbon and other emissions from transportation sources .

president obama requested $1,188.8 million for dot r&d and r&d facilities in fy2017 , an increase of $305.7 million ( 34.6% ) from the fy2016 enacted level .

 ( see table 18 . ) .

in fy2016 , two dot agencies â€” the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) and the federal aviation administration ( faa ) â€” account for more than three - fourths of the department's r&d funding ( 79% ) .

under the request , three agencies ( faa , fhwa , and the national highway traffic safety administration [nhtsa] ) would account for 88% of dot r&d in fy2017 .

funding for dot r&d is generally included in appropriations line items that also include non - r&d activities ; therefore , it is not possible to identify precisely how much of the funding that would be provided by appropriations legislation is allocated to r&d unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after dot agencies allocate their final appropriations to specific activities and report those figures .

the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has identified five core missions: to prevent terrorism and enhance security , to secure and manage the borders , to enforce and administer immigration laws , to safeguard and secure cyberspace , and to ensure resilience to disasters .

new technology resulting from research and development can contribute to all these goals .

the directorate of science and technology ( s&t ) has primary responsibility for establishing , administering , and coordinating dhs r&d activities .

the domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) is responsible for r&d relating to nuclear and radiological threats .

other components , such as the u.s. coast guard , conduct r&d relating to their specific missions .

in its fy2017 budget request , dhs proposed incorporating dndo , including its r&d responsibilities , into a new chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , and explosives ( cbrne ) office .

congress ultimately did not accept this proposal for the fy2017 appropriations cycle .

the president's fy2017 budget request for dhs included $654 million for activities identified as r&d .

this would have been a reduction of 4.5% from the comparable amount for fy2016 .

the total included $470 million for the s&t directorate , $152 million for the proposed cbrne office ( entirely for activities currently part of dndo ) , and smaller amounts for five other dhs components .

the house bill ( h.r .

5634 ) would have provided $665 million for these activities .

the senate bill ( s. 3001 ) would have provided approximately $703 million .

the final appropriation was $678 million .

see table 19 .

the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) , the federal regulatory agency responsible for implementing a number of environmental pollution control laws , funds a broad range of r&d activities to provide scientific tools and knowledge that support decisions relating to preventing , regulating , and abating environmental pollution .

beginning in fy2006 , congress has funded epa through the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations .

funding for epa r&d is generally included in line items that also include non - r&d activities ; therefore , it is not possible to identify precisely how much of the funding provided in appropriations bills is allocated to r&d alone unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels are determined after epa allocates its appropriations to specific activities and reports those amounts .

the agency's science and technology ( s&t ) account funds much of epa's scientific research activities .

these activities include r&d conducted by the agency at its own laboratories and facilities , and r&d and other related scientific research conducted by universities , foundations , and other non - federal entities that receive epa grants .

the s&t account receives a base appropriation and a transfer from the hazardous substance superfund ( superfund ) account .

the transferred funds are authorized for research on more effective methods to clean up contaminated sites .

the epa's office of research and development ( ord ) is the primary manager of r&d at epa headquarters and laboratories around the country , as well as external r&d .

a large portion of the s&t account funds epa r&d activities managed by ord , including the agency's research laboratories and research grants .

many of the programs implemented by other offices within epa have a research component , but the research component is not necessarily the primary focus of the program .

title ii of division g of the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l .

115-31 ; h.r .

244 ) provides $721.9 million for the epa s&t account for fy2017 including a $7.4 million rescission within the s&t account and transfers ( $15.5 million ) from the superfund account .

including the account rescission and the transfer , the fy2017 total for the s&t account represents 9.0% of the $8.06 billion fy2017 appropriations for the agency overall .

p.l .

115-31 stipulates that the rescission of unobligated balances of prior fiscal years appropriations within the s&t account is to be applied to program project areas to "...reflect changes to funding projections due to routine attrition..." during fy2017 .

in the explanatory statement accompanying h.r .

244 , the house committee on appropriations noted that epa's current workforce was below fy2016 levels and therefore included separate rescissions within the s&t and the environmental programs and management ( epm ) accounts to "...capture expected savings" as a result of the changes .

the act further stipulates that this rescission is not to be applied to "research: national priorities" within the s&t account .

as in previous fiscal year requests , the president's fy2017 budget request did not include funding for these "national priorities. .

the $4.1 million for these national priorities for fy2017 is for competitively awarded extramural research grants to fund "high - priority water quality and availability research by not - for - profit organizations. .

the same level of funding for these types of grants was included for fy2016 .

the fy2017 enacted appropriations did not include an additional $10.0 million provided in fy2016 for further epa research on oil and gas development in the appalachian basin ( $3.0 million , including $2.0 million for extramural funding ) and for certification and compliance activities related to vehicle and engine emissions ( $7.0 million ) .

as noted earlier in this report congress did not complete action on 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills for fy2017 prior to the end of fy2016 , including the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations .

the senate and house committees on appropriations had reported their respective interior , environment , and related agencies fy2017 appropriations bills during the 114 th congress â€” s. 3068 ( s.rept .

114-281 ) and h.r .

5538 ( h.rept .

114-632 ) â€” on june 16 , 2016 , and june 21 , 2016 , respectively .

h.r .

5538 passed in the house on july 14 , 2016 , but no action was scheduled on the senate bill .

title ii of each of the bills proposed funding for epa , including the s&t account .

table 20 at the end of this section presents the fy2017 amounts for program activities within epa's s&t account as enacted compared to the president's fy2017 budget request , the fy2016 enacted level , as well as , the proposed levels included in the 114 th congress house - passed h.r .

5538 and senate committee - reported s. 3068 .

as indicated in the table , the fy2017 enacted total appropriations for epa's s&t account is a decrease compared to the amounts enacted for fy2016 , requested for fy2017 and proposed in h.r .

5538 , but an increase above the proposed level included in s. 3068 .

as shown in table 20 , there is some variability when comparing the enacted fy2017 base amount for the s&t account for individual epa program and activity line items with the fy2016 enacted and fy2017 proposed funding levels , dependent on the specific activity .

the fy2017 consolidated appropriations explanatory statement provides additional guidance within the s&t account including two directives adopted from the senate report , s.rept .

114-281 , accompanying s. 3068 as reported during the 114 th congress .

the explanatory statement includes the senate committee on appropriations direction for the agency's national center for computational toxicology [ncct] "to develop data use guidance for toxcast and other computational data...," as well as the senate committee recommendation that epa support research efforts to establish a best practices approach for enhanced aquifer recharge [ear] in coordination with the u.s. geological survey .

the explanatory statement includes the committee's recommendation that epa contract with the national academy of sciences to peer review the agency's revised draft integrated risk information system assessment of formaldehyde should the review be completed in fy2017 .

title iv of division g , "general provisions," contains provisions that would generally restrict or prohibit the use of fy2017 funds by epa for implementing or proceeding with a number of regulatory actions , including in some instances conducting research to support these actions .

most of these general provisions have been included in previous fiscal year appropriations .

additional directives have been included in the form of administrative provisions within title ii of division g. the 114 th congress house - passed and senate - reported bills had proposed a number of additional general and administrative provisions , but most were not included in the fy2017 consolidated appropriations .

the proposed administrative provisions can be found in title ii and the general provisions in title iv house - passed h.r .

5538 and senate committee - reported s. 3068 .
