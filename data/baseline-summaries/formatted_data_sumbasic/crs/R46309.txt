the federal research and development ( r&d ) enterprise is a large and complex system , spanning the country , that includes government facilities and employees as well as federally funded work in industry , academia , and the nonprofit sector .

in fy2019 , federal agencies obligated an estimated $141.5 billion for r&d , including $39.6 billion for intramural r&d and $101.9 billion for extramural r&d .

its work is essential to u.s. economic prosperity , national security , health care , and other national priorities .

it also plays a substantial direct role in the u.s. economy .

today , the operation of the system is being affected profoundly by the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic and the national response to it .

this report provides an overview of how the nation's response to covid - 19 is affecting the federal r&d enterprise , how the federal government and others are addressing those effects , and issues that may arise as the situation develops .

the scope of this report is limited to the effects of covid - 19 on federally funded r&d .

it does not attempt to address effects on the broader u.s. r&d enterprise , the majority of which is funded by and conducted in the private sector .

in addition , it does not attempt to address the federal r&d resources now being focused on understanding the science of covid - 19 , developing tests and treatments , and otherwise applying r&d to address the pandemic .

as the scientific , government , and public understanding of covid - 19 has grown , the national response has evolved , and it is likely to continue to evolve .

the scope , scale , and dynamism of responses by the federal government , state and local governments , and the private sector are too great to catalog fully in this report .

rather , the report highlights key effects and issues of concern and provides examples of agency actions .

faced with the global spread of a contagious and deadly virus , u.s. institutions have taken a number of extraordinary measures .

one key response has been social distancingâlimiting close contacts between individuals in order to reduce opportunities for transmission of the virus .

this response has led to the closure of many businesses , schools , government offices , and other institutions .

where possible , these institutions have continued to operate via telework and e - learning .

research and development activities , however , often require physical access to unique facilities and equipment .

as a result , many r&d organizationsâincluding federal facilities as well as industrial and academic laboratories supported by federal fundsâhave closed or curtailed operations .

on march 9 , 2020 , omb authorized federal agencies to provide certain short - term relief from administrative , financial management , and auditing requirements for grantees involved in research related to covid - 19 .

on march 18 , four organizations representing universities and other research organizations wrote to omb requesting the expansion of these flexibilities to all research grants .

on march 19 , omb provided relief for "an expanded scope of recipients affected by the loss of operational capacity and increased costs due to the covid - 19 crisis. .

the appendix summarizes omb's government - wide administrative actions , extensions of authorities , and guidance .

it also provides a link to a compilation maintained by the council on governmental relations ( cogr ) of guidance from federal agencies , academic institutions , and other organizations , as well as frequently asked questions about how federal agencies that fund r&d are implementing the omb - directed flexibilities .

some agencies have compiled special guidance for awardees .

for example , an nih webpage provides information on changes to proposal submission and award management , updated policies on clinical trials and animal welfare , and revised procedures for peer review .

the national science foundation ( nsf ) has issued guidance for contractors operating nsf - funded facilities .

cogr has compiled links to such guidance , sorted by agency , along with links to institutional guidance from a long list of individual universities .

some agencies have extended the due dates for research proposals , announced that they will accommodate applications received late , or reduced the institutional approvals required for an initial proposal .

while these accommodations provide additional flexibility for researchers , delays in receiving and acting on proposals may result in delays in issuing awards .

some agencies have announced accommodations for existing awardees , such as no - cost extensions of awards , extensions of financial and other reporting deadlines , changes to the allowability of cancellation fees and costs resulting from the pausing and restarting of research , and allowing the continued payment of salaries and benefits out of grant funds .

while these steps give researchers additional flexibility , they may create challenges once research resumes .

for example , grant funds that have been spent on cancellation fees , activities required for the suspension of research , or researcher salaries while research is suspended necessarily reduce the balance of funds subsequently available to complete a research project .

no - cost extensions extend an award's completion date ; they do not provide additional funds to cover costs incurred because of delays .

congress has already enacted some legislation with r&d - related funding and provisions in response to the covid - 19 pandemic .

for example the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-123 ) , enacted on march 6 , 2020 , appropriated $836 million in supplemental funding for nih , with additional transferrable amounts from other accounts .

some of the $3.1 billion appropriated to the public health and social services emergency fund may also be made available to the biomedical advanced research and development authority for the development of covid - 19 medical countermeasures , such as therapies and vaccines .

the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act ( p.l .

116-136 ) , enacted on march 27 , 2020 , appropriated more than $1 billion in supplemental funding for r&d .

most of this total was for research on covid - 19 itself , including $945 million for nih , $415 million for research , development , testing , and evaluation ( rdt&e ) in the dod defense health program , and smaller sums for several other agencies .

the act also provided funding to several r&d agencies to offset unanticipated costs arising from the pandemic .

for example , nasa received $60 million to cover the costs of mission delays caused by center closures , while the u.s. forest service received $3 million to reestablish experiments affected by travel restrictions .

section 18004 of the cares act established a $14 billion higher education emergency relief fund for colleges and universities .

at least half of this total must be allocated for emergency financial aid grants to students .

it is not yet clear how much , if any , will be available to address issues directly related to r&d .

section 3610 of the cares act authorized federal agencies to reimburse contractors for "any paid leave , including sick leave , a contractor provides to keep its employees or subcontractors in a ready state" when they are unable to work on - site due to facility closures and telework is not an option .

although this provision is not specifically directed at r&d , it could be significant for agencies such as doe and nasa whose r&d facilities are staffed with numerous contractor employees .

section 12004 of the cares act authorized the patent and trademark office to temporarily suspend , modify , adjust , or waive timing deadlines under the patent act and the trademark act during the covid - 19 emergency period .

section 13006 of the cares act gave dod additional flexibility in the use of its other transaction authority for the development of prototypes related to covid - 19 .

the cares act provided nist laboratories with $6 million in additional funding , including $5 million to support and accelerate measurement science related to viral testing and biomanufacturing ; $50 million for the nist manufacturing extension partnership program to help companies across the country transform operations in support of covid - 19 related needs and to foster development of covid - 19 related supply chains ; and $10 million for research related activities at manufacturing usa's national institute for innovation in manufacturing biopharmaceuticals ( niimbl ) .

the cares act provided $2.25 million for the environmental protection agency's science and technology account to prevent , prepare for , and respond to coronavirus , domestically or internationally , including $1.5 million for research on methods to reduce the risks from environmental transmission of coronavirus via contaminated surfaces or materials .

the cares act provided nsf with $76 million "to prevent , prepare for , and respond to coronavirus , domestically or internationally , including to fund research grants and other necessary expenses. .

the senate appropriations committee summary notes that $75 million is to support nsf's rapid grant mechanism , "which will support near real - time research at the cellular , physiological , and ecological levels to better understand coronavirus," and $1 million is to assist in the administration of these grants .

in the house , speaker pelosi has announced plans for a special committee to oversee the federal response to covid - 19 , including the spending of supplemental funding provided under the above legislation .

several organizations from industry and academia have put forward policy recommendations to address r&d - related challenges resulting from covid - 19 .

congress may also seek to take additional actions through legislation or oversight .

the commercial spaceflight federation , an industry group , has asked congress for legislation directing the internal revenue service to provide for immediate refunds of accumulated research and experimentation ( r&e ) tax credits .

it argues that this would allow "continued innovation through r&d reinvestment. .

in many cases , under current law , companies that qualify for this credit are unable to use the full amount immediately because of insufficient tax liability or other factors ; unused amounts can be carried forward for up to 20 years .

the credit only applies to r&d funded by a company itself , but companies that conduct r&d with federal funding often fund their own r&d as well .

organizations representing research universities , medical schools , and teaching hospitals have asked congress , among other steps , to give research institutions receiving federal funding additional flexibility to cover researcher salaries and benefits while their institutions are affected , to provide $13 billion in additional extramural research funding , and to allow agencies to reprogram any supplemental funds that are not spent within a year for new awards .

the latter proposal , they argued , "could have a stimulative effect and help to address the nation's research competitiveness. .

noting that "many scientific societies have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by meeting and conference cancellations as a result of covid - 19," the federation of american societies for experimental biology has asked congress to include measures such as zero - interest loans and grant to associations , nonprofit organizations , and other tax - exempt organizations in future economic stimulus packages and supplemental appropriations measures .

while omb has issued guidance to agencies regarding administrative flexibilities and other issues , as described above , agency implementation of that guidance has varied .

representatives of the association of american universities have indicated that more uniform implementation by federal research funding agencies would reduce administrative burdens and uncertainties for award recipients .

congress may consider a variety of other legislative and oversight actions , either in the near term while the pandemic continues or retrospectively to improve the response to future crises .

these might include seeking a clearer understanding of how federally funded r&d is being affected by covid - 19 , through hearings , mandates for agency reports , support for academic studies , or mandates for reports by organizations such as the government accountability office or the national academies of sciences , engineering , and medicine ; directing omb , the office of science and technology policy , or an interagency task force to develop more uniform guidance on how to identify essential or critical r&d activities , with recommendations for implementing that guidance at government laboratories , universities , companies , and other institutions involved in intramural and extramural federally funded r&d ; and establishing a post - pandemic task force on the federal r&d enterprise to examine lessons learned from the covid - 19 pandemic and recommend policy changes to improve the national response of the r&d community in the event of future pandemics .

over time , the near - term and long - term effects of covid - 19 on the nation's r&d enterprise will become more apparent .

congress may monitor these effects and develop a deeper understanding of their implications for the wide - ranging national policy objectives that motivate federal spending on r&dâsuch as national security , economic growth and job creation , public health , transportation , and agricultureâas well as the implications for the u.s. science and engineering workforce and the education of the next generation of american scientists , engineers , and technicians .

the effects of covid - 19 on federally funded r&d , as described in this report , may adversely affect the pace of r&d generally and the pace of the innovation that builds on it .

the national and global economic consequences may have implications for economic growth , the workforce , the development of new products and services , and the competitiveness of companies and nations .

the extent of these effects cannot yet be known and may not be fully understood for years .

an optimist might hope for a silver lining .

if the r&d community learns to overcome some of the challenges of remote working and travel restrictions , that might create future opportunities , after the covid - 19 pandemic is over , for increased workplace flexibilities and reduced travel expenses .

the pandemic has also highlighted issues that congress may seek to address in the future , such as additional r&d on cybersecurity for virtual collaboration and rural access to broadband internet for off - site work during emergencies .

office of management and budget memoranda omb has issued a number of memoranda related to the covid - 19 response .

these memoranda are written broadly , not focused solely on federal r&d activities .

nevertheless , elements included in these memoranda have relevant information regarding the operation of the federal r&d enterprise .

the memoranda are downloadable from the omb website .

as of the date of this report , covid - 19-related memoranda include m - 20-19 harnessing technology to support mission continuity ( march 22 , 2020 ) directs agencies to utilize technology to the greatest extent practicable to support mission continuity .

the memorandum addresses a set of frequently asked questions to provide additional guidance and assist the it workforce as it addresses impacts of covid - 19 .
