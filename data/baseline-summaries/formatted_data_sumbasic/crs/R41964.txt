the fy2012 agriculture appropriations act ( p.l .

112-55 ) was signed by the president on november 18 , 2011 , as the lead division of a three - bill "minibus" appropriation .

the minibus passed both chambers by more than two - thirds majorities on november 17 , 2011 .

it reduces regular discretionary agriculture appropriations by $372 million to $19.8 billion , a cut of - 1.8% below fy2011 levels after adjusting for disaster designations and certain jurisdiction issues .

the act also includes $367 million of conservation - related disaster assistance that was not subject to the same budgetary caps ; with this spending , the appropriation is $20.2 billion , a slight increase over unadjusted fy2011 levels .

in december 2011 , the department of agriculture implemented provisions concerning livestock marketing , and restricting payment limits and mohair support .

the agriculture appropriations bill — formally known as the agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations act — provides funding for the following agencies and departments: all of the u.s. department of agriculture ( except the forest service , which is funded by the interior appropriations bill ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services , and in the house , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) .

in the senate , cftc appropriations are handled by the financial services appropriations subcommittee .

jurisdiction for the appropriations bill rests with the house and senate committees on appropriations , particularly each committee's subcommittee on agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies .

these subcommittees are separate from the agriculture authorizing committees — the house committee on agriculture and the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry .

both chambers passed the conference agreement for the fy2012 agriculture appropriations act on november 17 , 2011 , and the president signed it the next day ( table 1 ) .

it was the lead division of a three - bill "minibus" appropriation that also included commerce - justice - science and transportation - housing and urban development appropriations .

the minibus was the first fy2012 appropriation to be enacted , and it also included another short - term continuing resolution , through december 16 , 2011 , for the remaining nine appropriations bills .

the agriculture bill was the vehicle for the minibus since it was the only one of the three subcommittee bills in the minibus to have passed the house .

across the most recent 14 fiscal years , stand - alone agriculture appropriations bills were enacted five times , in fy2000-fy2002 , fy2006 , and fy2010 ( table a - 1 in the appendix ) .

omnibus appropriations were used seven times , in fy1999 , fy2003-fy2005 , fy2008 , fy2009 , and fy2012 .

year - long continuing resolutions were used two times , in fy2007 and fy2011 .

table a - 1 lists each appropriation and annual crs report .

figure a - 1 shows a timeline of enactment .

the agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill covers all of usda except for the forest service .

this amounts to nearly 95% of usda's total appropriation .

the forest service is funded through the interior appropriations bill .

the order of the following sections reflects the order that the agencies are listed in the agriculture appropriations bill ( except for the portion of fda appropriations for food safety , which is discussed in a comprehensive section on food safety ) .

see table 3 and tables in some of the following sections for more details on the amounts for specific agencies .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) regulates the safety of foods and cosmetics ; the safety and effectiveness of drugs , biologics ( eg , vaccines ) , and medical devices ; and public health aspects of tobacco products .

a part of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , fda had been housed in the department of agriculture until 1940 and the agriculture appropriations subcommittees retain jurisdiction over the fda budget .

fda's program level , the amount that fda can spend , is composed of direct appropriations ( also referred to as budget authority ) and user fees .

the enacted fy2012 appropriation provides fda a total program level of $3.899 billion .

that total is $209 million ( 5.7% ) more than what the agency received in fy2011 and 9.3% less than what the president requested for fy2012 .

the fy2011 appropriation provided the agency with a total direct appropriation of $2.457 billion .

the president's request for fy2012 was $2.744 billion .

the house - passed bill would have provided $2.155 billion and the senate - passed bill would have provided $2.506 .

the enacted conference agreement provided $2.506 billion .

this amount is 1.99% higher than the fy2011 appropriation and 8.68% lower than the president's request .

for user fees , the enacted fy2012 appropriation includes $1.393 billion in user fees .

the total includes prescription drug ( pdufa ) , medical device ( mdufa ) , animal drug ( adufa ) , animal generic drug ( agdufa ) , and tobacco product user fees ; certification and mammography quality standards act ( mqsa ) fees ; and newly authorized food and feed recall , food reinspection , and voluntary qualified importer program ( vqip ) fees .

not included in that total is $59.6 million in the president's request for as yet unauthorized fees for generic drugs ( gdufa ) , medical products reinspection , and international couriers .

the fy2012 enacted total for fees is 12.96% more than fy2011 .

adding to the suggestions and directives included in the house and senate committee reports ( h.rept .

112-101 and s.rept .

112-73 ) , the enacted conference agreement ( h.rept .

112-284 ) specifically directs fda to take five actions .

these actions are: 1. report to congress on plans to allocate the funding increases included in the conference agreement: $39 million to begin implementation of the food safety modernization act ; $30 million for advancing medical countermeasures ; and $13 million for mandatory rental payments ; 2. report to congress on specified lengths of time during the drug , biologic , and device application processes ( eg , "average number of calendar days that elapsed from the date that drug applications ... were submitted to the agency ... until the date that the drugs were approved" ) ; 3. publish a proposed rule regarding the safety and efficacy of over - the - counter cold and cough products for children ; 4. develop a comprehensive program for imported seafood inspections and safety ; 5. develop a clear strategy on prioritizing intervention methods to reduce foodborne illness from known and unknown sources .

consistent with the administration and congressional committee formats , each program area in table 19 includes funding designated for the responsible fda center ( eg , the center for drug evaluation and research or the center for food safety and applied nutrition ) and the portion of effort budgeted for the agency - wide office of regulatory affairs to commit to that area .

also apportions user fee revenue across the program areas as indicated in the administration's request ( eg , 90% of the animal drug user fee revenue is designated for the animal drugs and feeds program , with the rest going to headquarters and office of the commissioner , gsa rent , and other rent and rent - related activities categories ) .

table 19 displays , by program area , the budget authority ( direct appropriations ) , user fees , and total program levels for fda in fy2011 ( as calculated for the agency's june 2011 operating plan ) , the president's fy2012 request , h.r .

2112 as passed by the house , h.r .

2112 as passed by the senate , and the conference agreement p.l .

112-55 , signed by the president on november 18 , 2011 .

the final two columns show the percentage change from the president's fy2012 request or the june 2011 operating plan , respectively , to the fy2012 conference agreement .

the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets .

the cftc's functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges , registration and supervision of futures industry personnel , prevention of fraud and price manipulation , and investor protection .

the dodd - frank act ( p.l .

111-203 ) brought previously unregulated swaps markets under cftc jurisdiction .

although most derivatives trading is related to financial variables ( interest rates , currency prices , and stock indexes ) , congressional oversight remains vested in the agriculture committees because of the market's historical origins as an adjunct to agricultural trade .

appropriations for the cftc are under the jurisdiction of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee in the house , and the financial services and general government appropriations subcommittee in the senate .

for fy2011 , p.l .

112-10 provided $202 million for the cftc , up 20% from the $169 million provided for fy2010 before enactment of the dodd - frank act .

for fy2012 , the president requested $308 million , which would be $105 million more than fy2011 enacted appropriations .

the requested increase was intended to ensure that the cftc can meet its new regulatory responsibilities under the dodd - frank act .

for fy2012 , p.l .

112-55 provides $205.3 million for the cftc , an increase of $3.3 million over fy2011 .

this amount is $33.3 million more than the house recommended , but $34.7 million less than the senate appropriations committee recommendation , and about $103 million ( 33% ) below the administration's request .
