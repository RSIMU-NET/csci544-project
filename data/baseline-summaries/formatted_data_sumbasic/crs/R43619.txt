prior to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance policies without additional cost to the policyholders .

following the attacks , both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage .

because insurance is required for a variety of economic transactions , particularly borrowing for commercial development , it was feared that a lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wider economic impact .

congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 ( tria ) .

tria created a temporary three - year terrorism insurance program to calm the insurance markets through a government reinsurance backstop sharing in terrorism losses .

the idea was to give the private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk .

tria requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage , but does not require commercial policyholders to purchase the coverage .

this program was extended in 2005 and 2007 .

in 2005 , the extension legislation focused on reducing the government's exposure from tria by increasing the minimum covered event size , increasing the insurer deductible , reducing the government share of losses , and increasing the post - event mandatory recoupment .

in 2007 , the primary change was to accelerate the after - the - fact recoupment .

while the prospective government share of losses has been reduced over time , the 2007 reauthorization also expanded the program to cover losses from acts of domestic terrorism .

the tria program expired at the end of 2014 , as provided for in the 2007 extension .

the initial thresholds of the current program are as follows: 1 .

a terrorist act must cause $5Â million in insured losses to be certified for tria coverage .

2 .

the aggregate insured losses from a certified act of terrorism must be $100 million in a year for the government coverage to begin .

3 .

an individual insurer must meet a deductible of 20% of its annual premiums for the government coverage to begin .

once these thresholds are passed , the government covers 85% of insured losses due to terrorism with the private insurers retaining 15% of the losses .

no premiums are charged by the government for this coverage .

instead , if the insured losses are under $27.5 billion , the secretary of the treasury is required to recoup 133% of government outlays through a surcharge on commercial property / casualty insurance policies .

as insured losses rise above $27.5 billion , the secretary is required to recoup a reduced amount of the outlays .

at some high insured loss level , which will depend on the exact distribution of losses , the secretary would no longer be required to recoup outlays , but would retain the discretionary authority to do so .

under current law , all mandatory recoupment must be completed by the end of fy2017 .

since tria's passage , private industry's willingness and ability to cover terrorism risk have increased .

according to industry surveys , prices for terrorism coverage have generally trended downward , and approximately 60% of commercial policyholders have purchased coverage over the past few years .

this relative market calm has been under the umbrella of tria coverage , and it is unclear how the insurance market may react to the expiration of the federal program .

representative michael grimm along with nine cosponsors introduced h.r .

508 on february 5 , 2013 .

the bill is a reauthorization of the existing tria program that would extend the program five years , until the end of 2019 .

it would also extend the deadline for mandatory recoupment seven years , until september 30 , 2024 .

the bill has been referred to the house committee on financial services .

the bill would extend the expiration date of the program 10 years , until the end of 2024 , and would extend the deadline for mandatory recoupment seven years , until september 30 , 2024 .

it would also add the secretary of homeland security as the lead authority responsible for certifying an act of terrorism and require the secretary to provide information and reports on terrorism risks and best practices to foster resilience in the face of terrorism .

the secretary of the treasury would remain in the certification process but as a concurring party , not the lead authority ; the program in general would remain under the authority of the treasury .

h.r .

the bill would extend the current tria program seven years , until december 31 , 2021 , while also decreasing the federal loss sharing amount and increasing the amount to be retained by the industry and recouped by the government .

under these extended dates , if an act of terrorism occurs prior to 2018 , all mandatory recoupment premiums must be collected by september 30 , 2019 .

if an act occurs in 2018 , 35% of the mandatory recoupment premiums would be collected by september 30 , 2019 , with the rest by september 30 , 2024 .

if the terrorist act occurs after 2018 , all of the mandatory recoupment premiums would be collected by september 30 , 2024 .
