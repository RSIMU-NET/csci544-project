the small business administration ( sba ) administers programs to support small businesses , including several loan guaranty programs designed to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses "that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions. .

the sba's 504 certified development company ( 504 / cdc ) loan guaranty program provides long - term fixed rate financing for major fixed assets , such as land , buildings , equipment , and machinery .

its name is derived from section 504 of the small business investment act of 1958 ( p.l .

85-699 , as amended ) , which provides the most recent authorization in the act concerning the sba's monthly sale of 20-year and 25-year 504 / cdc debentures and bimonthly sale of 10-year 504 / cdc debentures .

the 504 / cdc loan guaranty program is administered through nonprofit certified development companies ( cdcs ) .

of the total project costs , a third - party lender must provide at least 50% of the financing , the cdc provides up to 40% of the financing backed by a 100% sba - guaranteed debenture , and the applicant provides at least 10% of the financing .

the borrower makes two loan payments , one to the third - party lender and another to the cdc .

the third - party loan , typically provided by a bank , can have a fixed or variable interest rate , is negotiated between the lender and the borrower , is subject to an interest rate cap , and must have at least a 7-year term for a 10-year debenture and at least 10-year term for a 20- or 25-year debenture .

the cdc loan has a fixed interest rate that is determined when the sba sells the debenture to fund the loan .

the cdc loan's term is either 10 years ( typically for machinery or equipment ) or 20 years or 25 years ( typically for real estate ) .

the sba's debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and is sold to underwriters that form debenture pools .

investors purchase interests in the debenture pools and receive development company participation certificates ( dcpc ) representing ownership of all or part of the pool .

dcpcs have a minimum value of $25,000 and can be sold on the secondary market .

the sba and cdcs use various agents to facilitate the sale and service of the certificates and the orderly flow of funds among the parties .

after a 504 / cdc loan is approved and disbursed , accounting for the loan is set up at the central servicing agent ( csa , currently pricewaterhousecoopers public sector llp ) , not the sba .

the sba guarantees the timely payment of the debenture .

if the small business is behind in its loan payments , the sba pays the difference to the investor on every semiannual due date .

in fy2018 , the sba approved 5,874 504 / cdc loans amounting to nearly $4.8 billion .

at the end of fy2018 , there were 56,601 504 / cdc loans with an unpaid principal balance of about $25.8 billion .

historically , one of the justifications presented for funding the sba's loan guaranty programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage , compared with other businesses , when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit .

congressional interest in small business access to capital , in general , and the 504 / cdc program , in particular , has increased in recent years because of concern that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to grow and create jobs .

congress authorized several changes to the 504 / cdc program during the 111 th congress in an effort to increase the number and amount of 504 / cdc loans .

for example p.l .

111-5 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ) , provided $375 million to temporarily reduce fees in the sba's 7 ( a ) and 504 / cdc loan guaranty programs ( $299 million ) and to temporarily increase the 7 ( a ) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% ( $76 million ) .

congress subsequently appropriated another $265 million and authorized the sba to reprogram another $40 million to extend those subsidies and the loan modification through may 31 , 2010 .

arra also authorized the sba to allow , under specified circumstances , the use of 504 / cdc program funds to refinance existing debt for business expansion .

p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 , increased the 504 / cdc program's loan guaranty limits from $1.5 million to $5 million for "regular" borrowers , from $2 million to $5 million if the loan proceeds are directed toward one or more specified public policy goals , and from $4 million to $5.5 million for manufacturers .

the act also temporarily expanded for two years after the date of enactment ( or until september 27 , 2012 ) the types of projects eligible for refinancing of existing debt under the 504 / cdc program ; provided $505 million ( plus an additional $5 million for administrative expenses ) to continue fee subsidies for the 7 ( a ) loan guaranty program and the 504 / cdc program through december 31 , 2010 ; and established an alternative size standard that allows more companies to qualify for 504 / cdc assistance .

p.l .

111-322 , the continuing appropriations and surface transportation extensions act , 2011 , authorized the sba to continue the fee subsidies and the 7 ( a ) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through march 4 , 2011 , or until funding provided for these purposes in p.l .

111-240 was exhausted ( which occurred on january 3 , 2011 ) .

during the 114 th congress , p.l .

114-113 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , reinstated the expansion of the types of projects eligible for refinancing under the 504 / cdc loan guaranty program in any fiscal year in which the refinancing program and the 504 / cdc program as a whole do not have credit subsidy costs .

the act requires each cdc to limit its refinancing so that , during any fiscal year , the new refinancings do not exceed 50% of the dollars it loaned under the 504 / cdc program during the previous fiscal year .

this limitation may be waived if the sba determines that the refinance loan is needed for good cause .

an interim final rule implementing the new refinancing program was issued by the sba on may 25 , 2016 , effective june 24 , 2016 .

during the 115 th congress , p.l .

115-371 , the small business access to capital and efficiency ( ace ) act , amended the small business investment act of 1958 to increase the threshold amount for determining when a cdc is required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504 / cdc loan ( from if the estimated value of the project property is greater than $250,000 to if the estimated value of the project property is greater than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold , which was increased from $250,000 to $500,000 in 2018 ) .

in addition , the trump administration proposed in its fy2020 budget request that the maximum dollar amount for a 504 loan to a small manufacturer be increased to $6.5 million from $5.5 million .

this report opens with a discussion of the rationale for the 504 / cdc program and then examines the program's borrower and lender eligibility standards ; program requirements ; and program statistics , including loan volume , loss rates , proceeds usage , borrower satisfaction , and borrower demographics .

next , it surveys congressional action taken during recent congresses to enhance small business access to capital , including arra , p.l .

111-240 , p.l .

114-113 , and p.l .

115-371 .

this report also discusses issues raised concerning the sba's administration of the program , including the oversight of 504 / cdc lenders .

as shown in table 1 , 504 / cdc projects generally have three main participants: a third - party lender provides 50% or more of the financing ; a cdc provides up to 40% of the financing through a 504 / cdc debenture , which is 100% guaranteed by the sba ; and the borrower contributes at least 10% of the financing .

the cdc's contribution , and the amount of the sba's 100% guaranteed debenture , generally cannot exceed 40% of the financing for standard 504 / cdc loans .

it cannot exceed 35% of the financing for new businesses ( defined as "a business that is two years old or less at the time the loan is approved" ) or if the loan is for either a limited - market property ( defined as "a property with a unique physical design , special construction materials , or a layout that restricts its utility to the use for which it is designed" ) or a special purpose property .

the sba lists 27 limited and special purpose properties ( eg , dormitories , golf courses , hospitals , and bowling alleys ) .

the cdc's contribution cannot exceed 30% of the financing when the borrower is a new business and the loan is for either a limited - market property or a special purpose property .

borrowers must contribute at least 10% of the financing for standard 504 / cdc loans and at least 15% of the financing if the borrower is a new business or if the loan is for a limited - market property or a special purpose property .

they must contribute at least 20% of the financing if the borrower is a new business and the loan is for either a limited - market property or a special purpose property .

as mentioned previously , congress approved legislation in 2009 ( arra ) that provided the sba an additional $730 million , including $299 million to temporarily reduce fees in the sba's 504 / cdc loan guaranty and 7 ( a ) programs and $76 million to temporarily increase the 7 ( a ) program's loan guaranty from up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% of loans exceeding $150,000 .

congress approved legislation in 2010 ( p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 ) that was designed to enhance small business access to capital .

among other provisions , the act provided $510 million to extend the 504 / cdc and 7 ( a ) loan guaranty programs' fee subsidies and the 7 ( a ) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through december 31 , 2010 ( later extended to march 4 , 2011 ) or until available funding was exhausted ( which occurred on january 3 , 2011 ) ; increased the 504 / cdc program's loan limits from $1.5 million to $5 million for regular 504 / cdc loans ; from $2 million to $5 million if the loan proceeds are directed toward one or more of the program's specified public policy goals ; from $4 million to $5.5 million for small manufacturers ; from $4 million to $5.5 million for projects that reduce the borrower's energy consumption by at least 10% ; and from $4 million to $5.5 million for projects for plant , equipment , and process upgrades of renewable energy sources , such as the small - scale production of energy for individual buildings or communities consumption ( commonly known as micropower ) , or renewable fuel producers , including biodiesel and ethanol producers ; temporarily expanded , for two years after enactment ( through september 27 , 2012 ) , the types of projects eligible for 504 / cdc program refinancing of existing commercial debt ; and authorized the sba to establish an alternative size standard for the 7 ( a ) and 504 / cdc programs that uses maximum tangible net worth and average net income as an alternative to the use of industry standards and established an interim size standard of a maximum tangible net worth of not more than $15 million and an average net income after federal taxes ( excluding any carryover losses ) for the preceding two fiscal years of not more than $5 million .

the obama administration argued that increasing maximum loan limit for sba programs ( including the 504 / cdc program ) would allow the sba to "support larger projects," which would "allow the sba to help america's small businesses drive long - term economic growth and the creation of jobs in communities across the country. .

the administration also argued that increasing the maximum loan limits for these programs will be "budget neutral" over the long run and "help improve the availability of smaller loans. .

critics of increasing the sba's maximum loan limits argued that doing so might increase the risk of defaults , resulting in higher guaranty fees or the need to provide the sba additional funding .

others advocated a more modest increase in the maximum loan limits to ensure that the 7 ( a ) program "remains focused on startup and early - stage small firms , businesses that have historically encountered the greatest difficulties in accessing credit" and "avoids making small borrowers carry a disproportionate share of the risk associated with larger loans. .

others contended that creating a small business direct lending program within the sba would reduce paperwork requirements and be more efficient in providing small businesses access to capital than modifying existing sba programs that rely on private lenders to determine if they will issue the loans .

also , as mentioned previously , others argued that providing additional resources to the sba or modifying the sba's loan programs as a means to augment small businesses' access to capital is ill - advised .

in their view , the sba has limited impact on small businesses' access to capital .

they argued that the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation is to focus on small business tax reduction , reform of financial credit market regulation , and federal fiscal restraint .

as mentioned previously , congress did not approve any changes to the 504 / cdc program during the 112 th congress .

however , legislation was introduced during the 112 th congress to change the program , including several proposals to extend the now - expired two - year temporary expansion of the eligibility of 504 / cdc refinancing projects not involving expansions .

proponents of extending the 504 / cdc refinancing expansion provision , initially enacted as part of p.l .

111-240 , the small business jobs act of 2010 , argued that it would create jobs by enabling small business owners to lower their monthly payments "at no cost to taxpayers" and "is one of many things that we should be doing to put more capital in the hands of america's job creators. .

opponents worried that the provision may require funding to cover loan losses in the future , arguing that "commercial refinancing may pose an undue risk … at a time of significant budgetary constraints. .

others opposed the expansion of 504 / cdc refinancing on economic or ideological grounds , arguing that federal fiscal restraint , business tax reduction , and business regulatory relief would provide greater assistance to small businesses than expanding an existing sba spending program .

h.r .

2950 , the small business administration 504 loan refinancing extension act of 2011 , was introduced on september 15 , 2011 , and referred to the house committee on small business .

the bill would have allowed 504 / cdc loans to be used to refinance projects not involving expansions as long as the financing did not exceed 90% of the value of the collateral for the financing for an additional year beyond the two years from the date of enactment that was authorized by the small business jobs act of 2010 .

s.amdt .

1833 , the invest in america act of 2012 — an amendment in the nature of a substitute for h.r .

3606 , the jumpstart our business startups act — was introduced on march 15 , 2012 .

it would have allowed 504 / cdc loans to be used to refinance projects not involving expansions for an additional year beyond the two years from the date of enactment authorized by the small business jobs act of 2010 .

the amendment was ruled nongermane by the chair on march 21 , 2012 , and was not included in the final version of the bill that was approved by the senate the following day .

s. 3572 , the restoring tax and regulatory certainty to small businesses act of 2012 , was introduced on september 19 , 2012 , and referred to the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship and the senate committee on finance .

it would have allowed 504 / cdc loans to be used to refinance projects not involving expansions for an additional year and a half beyond the two years from the date of enactment authorized by the small business jobs act of 2010 .

s. 1828 , a bill to increase small business lending , and for other purposes , was introduced on november 8 , 2011 , and referred to the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship .

the bill would have reinstated for a year following the date of its enactment the fee subsidies for the 504 / cdc and 7 ( a ) loan guaranty programs and the 90% loan guaranty percentage for the 7 ( a ) program that were originally funded by arra .

two bills were introduced during the 113 th congress to reinstate the temporary two - year expansion of projects eligible for 504 / cdc program refinancing of existing debt , which expired on september 27 , 2012 .

h.r .

1240 , the commercial real estate and economic development ( creed ) act of 2013 , would have reinstated the temporary expansion of the projects eligible for 504 / cdc program refinancing of existing debt for five years following the bill's enactment .

it was referred to the house committee on small business on march 18 , 2013 .

its companion bill in the senate ( s. 289 ) was referred to the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship on february 12 , 2013 , and was ordered to be reported favorably , with an amendment , on june 17 , 2013 .

as amended , s. 289 would have reinstated the temporary expansion of the projects eligible for 504 / cdc program refinancing of existing debt during any fiscal year in which the 504 / cdc program is operating at zero subsidy .

in addition , h.r .

4652 , the increasing small business lending act , would have authorized fee waivers for the 7 ( a ) and 504 / cdc programs .

as mentioned previously , p.l .

114-113 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , reinstated the expansion of the types of projects eligible for refinancing under the 504 / cdc loan guaranty program in any fiscal year in which the refinancing program and the 504 / cdc program as a whole do not have credit subsidy costs .

the act requires each cdc to limit its refinancing so that , during any fiscal year , the new refinancings do not exceed 50% of the dollars it loaned under the 504 / cdc program during the previous fiscal year .

this limitation may be waived if the sba determines that the refinance loan is needed for good cause .

an interim final rule implementing the new refinancing program was issued by the sba on may 25 , 2016 , effective june 24 , 2016 .

the act also eliminated an alternative job retention goal provision that allowed borrowers that do not meet the 504 / cdc program's job creation and retention goals to participate in the expanded refinancing program , but limited that participation to "not more than the product obtained by multiplying the number of employees of the borrower by $65,000. .

previously , h.r .

2266 , the commercial real estate and economic development act of 2015 , would have reinstated the temporary expansion of projects eligible for 504 / cdc program refinancing of existing debt for five years following enactment .

its companion bill in the senate ( s. 966 ) , as amended in committee , would have reinstated the temporary expansion of the refinancing program during any fiscal year in which the 504 / cdc program is operating at zero subsidy .

also , the obama administration had requested in its fy2016 budget request authority to reinstate the 504 / cdc refinancing program ( without a business expansion requirement ) in fy2016 to support up to $7.5 billion in lending .

as mentioned previously , p.l .

115-371 , the small business access to capital and efficiency ( ace ) act , increased the threshold amount for determining when a cdc is required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504 / cdc loan ( from if the estimated value of the project property is greater than $250,000 to if the estimated value of the project property is greater than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold , which was recently increased from $250,000 to $500,000 ) .

the act also increased the threshold amount for determining when a cdc may be required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504 / cdc loan ( from if the estimated value of the project property is equal to or less than $250,000 and such appraisal is necessary for appropriate evaluation of creditworthiness to if the estimated value of the project property is equal to or less than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold and such appraisal is necessary for appropriate evaluation of creditworthiness ) .

the change was designed to "remove the uncertainty lenders now have juggling two different real estate appraisal thresholds. .

in addition , s. 347 , the investing in america's small manufacturers act , among other provisions , would have allowed cdcs to provide up to 50% of project costs instead of up to 40% if the borrower is a small manufacturer and the 504 / cdc loan guarantee program's subsidy cost for that current fiscal year is not above zero .

during the 111 th congress , congressional debate concerning proposed changes to the sba's loan guaranty programs , including the 504 / cdc program , centered on the likely impact the changes would have on small business access to capital , job retention , and job creation .

as a general proposition , some , including president obama , argued that economic conditions made it imperative that the sba be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start , continue , or expand operations , and create jobs .

others worried about the long - term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit and advocated business tax reduction , reform of financial credit market regulation , and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation .

in terms of specific program changes , continuing the 504 / cdc program's temporary fee subsidies , increasing its loan limits , temporarily ( and later permanently ) expanding its refinancing options , and authorizing the sba to establish an alternative size standard were designed to achieve the same goal: to enhance job creation and retention by increasing the ability of 504 / cdc borrowers to obtain credit at affordable rates .

critics argued that these actions might increase the risk of defaults and result in higher guaranty fees or the need to provide the sba additional funding to cover loan subsidy costs .

others advocated a more modest increase in the maximum loan limits to ensure that the programs focus on start - ups and early - stage small firms , "businesses that have historically encountered the greatest difficulties in accessing credit," and that they avoid "making small borrowers carry a disproportionate share of the risk associated with larger loans. .

during the 112 th - 115 th congresses , congressional oversight focused on the sba's administration of the program changes enacted during the 111 th congress , the impact of those changes on the sba's lending , and ways to address and minimize increased costs associated with loan losses .

although there continues to be widespread congressional support for providing assistance to small businesses , federal fiscal constraints may impede efforts to further expand the 504 / cdc program in the near future .

given existing fiscal constraints , it is likely that congressional oversight during the 116 th congress will continue to focus on ( 1 ) the sba's administration of the 504 / cdc program to ensure that the program is as efficient as possible ; and ( 2 ) the program's efficacy in job retention and creation .
