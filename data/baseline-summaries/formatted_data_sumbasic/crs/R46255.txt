the u.s. government administers multiple international food assistance programs that aim to alleviate hunger and improve food security in other countries .

some of these programs provide emergency assistance to people affected by conflict or natural disaster .

other programs provide nonemergency assistance to address chronic poverty and hunger , such as by providing food to people during a seasonal food shortage or training communities on issues related to nutrition .

u.s. international food assistance programs originated in 1954 with the food for peace act ( p.l .

83-480 ) , also referred to as p.l .

480 .

historically , the united states has provided international food assistance primarily through in - kind aid , whereby u.s. commodities are shipped to countries in need .

congress typically funds in - kind food aid programs through the agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies appropriations actâknown as the agriculture appropriations bill .

the agriculture appropriations bill funds the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) except for the forest service .

in 2010 , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) began providing market - based assistance to supplement in - kind aid in emergency and nonemergency situations .

market - based assistance provides cash transfers , vouchers , or local and regional procurement ( lrp ) âfood purchased in the country or region where it is to be distributed rather than purchased in the united states .

congress funds most market - based assistance through the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) appropriations bill .

the sfops appropriations bill funds the u.s. department of state , usaid , and other non - defense foreign policy agencies .

for fy2020 , the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) provided approximately $4.091 billion for u.s. international food assistance programs .

this was an 11% decrease from the $4.581 billion provided in fy2019 .

division b of p.l .

116-94 provided $1.945 billion for international food assistance programs in agriculture appropriations , including $1.725 billion for the food for peace ( ffp ) title ii program and $220 million for the mcgovern - dole international food for education and child nutrition program .

division g of p.l .

116-94 provided an estimated $2.146 billion for international food assistance programs in sfops appropriations .

this included an estimated $2.066 billion for the emergency food security program ( efsp ) and $80 million for the community development fund ( cdf ) .

this report provides an overview of accounts in the agriculture and sfops appropriations bills that fund international food assistance programs .

it summarizes the trump administration's fy2020 budget request for international food assistance .

the report then details the international food assistance provisions in the fy2020 enacted agriculture and sfops appropriations billsâdivision b and division g of p.l .

116-94 , respectively .

congress funds most u.s. international food assistance programs through two annual appropriations billsâthe agriculture appropriations bill and the sfops appropriations bill .

the following sections detail each account in the agriculture and sfops appropriations bills that funds international food assistance and the programs funded through these accounts .

table 1 lists each international food assistance account along with the respective appropriations bill , funded programs , primary delivery method , and implementing agency .

figure 1 depicts each u.s. international food assistance program by authorizing and appropriations committee jurisdiction and implementing agency .

for the third year in a row , the trump administration's fy2020 budget request proposed eliminating mcgovern - dole and ffp title ii .

however , unlike in the fy2018 and fy2019 requestsâin which the president proposed shifting all funding for international food assistance to the ida account within the sfops appropriations billâthe president's fy2020 request proposed creating a new international humanitarian assistance ( iha ) account .

the proposed iha account would have consolidated four humanitarian assistance accountsâthe ida , migration and refugee assistance , and emergency refugee and migration assistance accounts that are funded in sfops appropriations , along with ffp title ii within agriculture appropriationsâinto a single account within the sfops appropriations bill .

the fy2020 budget request also repeated past proposals to eliminate food for progress and merge the da account with the economic support fund ( esf ) , democracy fund ( df ) , and assistance for europe , eurasia , and central asia ( aeeca ) accounts to create a new economic support and development fund ( esdf ) within sfops appropriations .

congress did not adopt the administration's fy2020 proposals to eliminate ffp title ii , mcgovern - dole , or food for progress or create the new combined iha and esdf accounts .

the following section summarizes the administration's fy2020 budget requests for u.s. international food assistance programs in the agriculture and sfops appropriations bills .

the fy2020 agriculture appropriations act provided funding for u.s. international food assistance programs in the foreign assistance and related programs title ( title v ) .

this included funding for ffp title ii and mcgovern - dole .

the act also provided funding for administrative expenses to manage existing ffp title i loans that originated while the ffp title i program was active .

unlike in fy2019 , congress did not provide discretionary funding in fy2020 for the food for progress program .

the fy2020 sfops appropriations act provided funding for international food assistance programs in bilateral assistance ( title iii ) .

figure 2 shows funding trends for international food assistance programs for fy2015-fy2020 .

table 2 details appropriations for international food assistance programs for fy2018-fy2020 , including proposed funding levels in the fy2020 administration's request and house and senate agriculture and sfops appropriations bills .

in addition to providing funding , the agriculture and sfops appropriations bills may contain policy - related provisions that direct the executive branch how to spend certain funds .

provisions included in appropriations act text have the force of law but generally only for the duration of the fiscal year for which the act provides appropriations .

policy - related provisions generally do not amend the u.s. code .

table 3 compares select policy - related provisions pertaining to u.s. international food aid programs from the foreign assistance and related programs ( title v ) and general provisions ( title vii ) titles of the fy2019 and fy2020 agriculture appropriations acts .

there was no language from the sfops bills for a similar table .

the explanatory statement that accompanies the appropriations act , as well as the committee reports that accompany the house and senate committee - reported bills , can provide statements of support for certain programs or directions to federal agencies on how to spend certain funding provided in the appropriations bill .

while these documents generally do not have the force of law , they can express congressional intent .

the committee reports and explanatory statement may need to be read together to capture all of the congressional intent for a given fiscal year .

table 4 compares selected policy - related provisions pertaining to u.s. international food aid programs from the fy2019 and fy2020 house and senate committee reports and explanatory statement for the fy2020 agriculture appropriations act .

table 5 compares one selected policy - related provision pertaining to u.s. international food assistance programs from the fy2019 and fy2020 house and senate committee reports and explanatory statement for the fy2020 sfops appropriation .
