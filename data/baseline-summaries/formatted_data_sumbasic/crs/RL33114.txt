in merck kgaa v. integra lifesciences i , ltd . , __ u.s. __ , 125 s. ct. 2372 ( 2005 ) , the united states supreme court decided , without dissent , that the patent law's safe harbor provision exempts from infringement the preclinical use of patented inventions in drug research .

without this legal immunity , pharmaceutical companies face patent infringement liability when they conduct preclinical experiments using rival companies' patented compounds .

the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit had earlier found that the statutory exemption applied only to clinical research activity that contributes "relatively directly" to information the food and drug administration ( fda ) considers in approving a drug .

this narrow interpretation of the safe harbor provision had raised concerns that the patent law could significantly restrict the development and introduction of new medical treatments and generic drugs .

vacating the appellate court's decision , the u.s. supreme court unanimously ruled that the exemption protects all uses of patented inventions that are "reasonably related" to the process of developing any information for fda submission , which includes preclinical studies .

the court's expansive construction of the safe harbor provision "leaves adequate space for experimentation and failure on the road to regulatory approval" and "provides a wide berth for the use of patented drugs in activities related to the federal regulatory process. .

it is normally a violation of the patent act to use any patented invention without prior authorization of the patent owner .

however , a statutory exception to this general rule provides: "it shall not be an act of infringement to make , use , offer to sell , or sell within the united states or import into the united states a patented invention ... solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information" to the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) .

thus , a party that uses a patented invention without the patent owner's permission is committing an infringing act , but if the use comes within the scope of the statutory exception , the party will not be held liable for violating the patent owner's rights .

the patent act's safe harbor provision has often been compared to the "fair use" defense in copyright law , since it immunizes from liability otherwise infringing acts in order to advance compelling public policy interests .

the legislative history of the hatch - waxman act provides the basis for this analogy: "just as we have recognized the doctrine of fair use in copyright , it is appropriate to create a similar mechanism in the patent law .

that is all this bill does. .

despite this deceptively simple language of purpose , the safe harbor provision has been the subject of confusion and litigation for many years following its enactment .

for over two decades , federal courts struggled to define the breadth and contours of the exemption , particularly concerning the types and uses of patented invention covered by the safe harbor .

the question presented to the supreme court was "whether uses of patented inventions in preclinical research , the results of which are not ultimately included in a submission to the food and drug administration ( fda ) , are exempted from infringement by 35 u.s.c .

â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) . .

in a unanimous opinion written by justice scalia , the court vacated the judgment of the federal circuit and held that the â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) safe harbor protected the preclinical use of patented compounds "as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing that the experiments will produce 'the types of information that are relevant to an ind or nda'" submission to the fda .

the court explained: [w]e think it apparent from the statutory text that â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) 's exemption from infringement extends to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the development and submission of any information under the fdca .

.. .

this necessarily includes preclinical studies of patented compounds that are appropriate for submission to the fda in the regulatory process .

there is simply no room in the statute for excluding certain information from the exemption on the basis of the phase of research in which it is developed or the particular submission in which it could be included .

the court rejected integra's argument that the scope of the safe harbor is limited only to preclinical studies pertaining to the safety of a drug in humans .

since the fda requires an ind to be filed before human trials can begin , ind applications must include summaries of a drug's efficacy , pharmacokinetics , pharmacology , and toxicological effects in animals .

this data would necessarily have to be developed in preclinical studiesâinformation that is "reasonably related" to an fda submission and thus covered by â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) .

the court further disagreed with integra's claim that merck's preclinical research is disqualified from safe harbor protection because the experiments were not conducted in conformity with the fda's "good laboratory practices" ( glp ) regulations .

two reasons supported the court's reasoning: first , the fda's glp regulations concerning preclinical studies apply only to experiments on drugs "to determine their safety," and not to studies of a drug's efficacy , mechanism of action , pharmacology , or pharmacokinetics ; second , even non - glp compliant safety - related studies are suitable for submission in an ind , when such studies are accompanied by a reason for the noncompliance .

the original legislative intent behind the hatch - waxman act that created â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) was to facilitate the introduction of a generic drug upon the patent expiration of the brand name drug .

however , as the supreme court explained in the eli lilly case that broadened â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) beyond generic drugs to the entire statutory scheme of fda regulation: "[i]t is not the law that a statute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history. .

the consequences of the supreme court's decision in integra are significant .

some observers argue that if the federal circuit's opinion had not been vacated , its narrow interpretation of the patent law's safe harbor potentially would have created a chilling effect on the development of innovative , pioneer drugs and new generic drugs .

limiting â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) to only clinical research appears contrary to the objectives of the hatch - waxman act: if a drug manufacturer could not perform the preclinical studies needed to obtain fda approval to conduct clinical studies , "the [â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) ] exemption would never be reached because the underlying preliminary research and development work could not be undertaken" without risking patent infringement liability .

the supreme court's more expansive construction of â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) avoids this result .

since "it will not always be clear to parties setting out to seek fda approval for their new product exactly which kinds of information , and in what quantities , it will take to win that agency's approval," the safe harbor provision is needed to immunize certain preclinical studies that use patented compounds .

the court also provided an articulated standard for courts , scientists , drug companies , and patent holders to follow concerning the scope of â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) coverage: safe harbor applies if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the preclinical experiments will produce information that is relevant to an ind or nda submission with the fda .

failure to meet this standard would constitute infringing conduct not exempted by â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) .

by unanimous opinion , the integra court has emphatically clarified that preclinical use of patented compounds in pharmaceutical research is not categorically unprotected and can qualify for the patent law's safe harbor as long as it comes within this enunciated standard .

however , the integra court left unresolved the issue of whether research tools come within the scope of the safe harbor exemption .

it is important to note that integra does not affect the validity and value of patented research tools when they are employed in basic research or for purposes unrelated to an fda submission .

yet the unauthorized use of research tools in the development of information for the fda regulatory process may constitute infringing conduct or could be exempted by the patent law's safe harbor .

this legal uncertainty raises concerns about the enforceability of research tool patents in this circumstance .

unless or until the supreme court answers this question in a future case , congress may desire to clarify â§ 271 ( e ) ( 1 ) 's applicability to research tools .
