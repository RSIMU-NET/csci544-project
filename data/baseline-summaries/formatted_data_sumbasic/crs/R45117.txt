the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .

it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .

in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .

the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .

as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .

annual u.s. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period .

when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .

according to ers , u.s. net farm income is forecast at $66.3 billion in 2018 , down 12% from last year ( table a - 1 ) .

this forecast includes the first round of payments under the trade aid package announced by usda in july 2018 .

under the initial phase of the trade aid package , usda expects to provide about $4.7 billion in direct payments to qualifying agricultural producers .

the forecast decline in 2018 net farm income represents continued agriculture - sector economic weakness since 2013's record high of $123.8 billion .

abundant domestic and international supplies of grains and oilseeds suggest a fourth straight year of relatively weak commodity prices in 2018 ( figure a - 1 through figure a - 4 , and table a - 4 ) .

u.s. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income , especially since 2005 .

as a result , the downturn in those exports that followed 2014's peak of $152.3 billion both coincided with and deepened the downturn in farm income that started in fy2015 .

in general , since reaching $137.4 billion in fy2011 , u.s. agricultural exports have fluctuated between $130 billion and $152 billion ( figure 20 ) .

the u.s. farm income and asset - value situation and outlook suggest a relatively stable financial position heading into 2018 for the agriculture sector as a whole — but with considerable uncertainty regarding the downward outlook for prices and market conditions for the sector and an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses: farm asset values — which reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investments — are projected to be up 1.4% in 2018 to a nominal $3 trillion ( table a - 3 ) .

in inflation - adjusted terms ( using 2017 dollars ) , farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( figure 24 ) .

nominally higher farm asset values are expected in 2018 due to strength in real estate values ( +2.1% ) , which offset a decrease in non - real estate values ( - 4.4% ) .

real estate traditionally accounts for the bulk of the total value of farm sector assets — nearly an 81% share .

crop land values are closely linked to commodity prices .

the leveling off of crop land values in 2017 reflects mixed forecasts for commodity prices ( corn , soybeans , and cotton lower ; wheat , rice , and livestock products higher ) and the uncertainty associated with international commodity markets ( figure 25 ) .

total farm debt is forecast to rise to $409.5 billion in 2018 ( +4.8% ) ( table a - 3 ) .

farm equity ( or net worth , defined as asset value minus debt ) is projected to be up slightly ( +1.0% ) at $2.6 trillion in 2018 ( table a - 3 ) .

the farm debt - to - asset ratio is forecast up in 2018 at 13.5% , the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( figure 26 ) .

farm household wealth is derived from a variety of sources .

a farm can have both an on - farm and an off - farm component to its balance sheet of assets and debt .

thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of other stakeholders in farming — including landlords and contractors — and because farm operator households often have nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy .

average farm household income ( sum of on - and off - farm income ) is projected at $111,321 in 2018 ( table a - 2 ) , down 1.9% from 2017 and well below the record of $134,164 in 2014 .

about 17% ( $18,637 ) of total farm household income is from farm production activities , and the remaining 83% ( $92,684 ) is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) .

the share of farm income derived from off - farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( figure 27 ) .

since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 28 and figure 29 ) .

in 2017 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income of $113,495 was about 27% higher than the average u.s. household income of $89,632 ( table a - 2 ) .

usda monthly farm prices received charts the following set of four charts ( figure a - 1 to figure a - 4 ) presents usda data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commodities — corn , soybeans , wheat , upland cotton , rice , milk , cattle , hogs , and chickens .

the data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons .

usda farm income data tables three tables at the end of this report ( table a - 1 to table a - 3 ) present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of u.s. agriculture .

in addition , table a - 4 presents the annual average farm price received for several major commodities , including the usda forecast for the 2018-2019 marketing year .
