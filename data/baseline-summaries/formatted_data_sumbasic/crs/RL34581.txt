as of february 11 , 2009 , a total of 240 persons have served for 30 years or more in the united states congress as representative or senator .

that number is only 2% of the 11,893 men and women who have represented their states and congressional districts since the first congress convened on march 4 , 1789 .

of the 240 members serving 30 years or more , 139 served only in the house of representatives ; 29 served only in the senate ; and 72 served in both chambers .

four of the 240 members are women , three of whom have served in the house and senate .

over time , the number of members serving 30 years or more has grown .

only two members with over 30 years of service began serving in congress in the 18 th century: nathaniel macon began his service in 1791 ; samuel smith , in 1793 .

seven served entirely during the 19 th century .

by 1967 ( 90 th congress ) , a total of 100 members had served 30 years or more .

as of february 11 , 2009 , ( 111 th congress ) that number had risen to 240 .

among members of the 111 th congress , 16 incumbent senators and 18 incumbent representatives have served 30 years or longer .

table 1 lists members who have served 30 years or longer in descending order of the length of their congressional service , as measured in days .

for each member , the table presents the member's party and state represented ; dates of the member's first and last day of service , by chamber ; days of service in each chamber ; and total days of congressional service .

total service is also presented in years and fractions of years .

calculations of days of service varied according to the pattern of a member's service .

for example â€” clarence a. cannon of missouri served in one continuous period from 3 / 4 / 1923 through 5 / 12 / 1964 .

the elapsed time from one date to the other was 15,045 , but because representative cannon served for each of the elapsed days and on the first day , we add one day to the elapsed time for a total of 15,046 days .

justin morrill served in both the house and the senate , continuously from 3 / 4 / 1855 to 3 / 3 / 1867 in the house ( 4,383 days ) and from 3 / 4 / 1867 to 12 / 28 / 1898 in the senate ( 11,623 days ) .

morrill's total congressional service was the sum of those two periods , 16,006 days .

henry jackson of washington also served continuously in both the house and the senate , but because of a statutory change there is an overlap of one day in his official dates of service .

jackson served in the house from 1 / 3 / 1941 through 1 / 3 / 1953 , but his first day in the senate was also on 1 / 3 / 1953 .

if we simply added his house service ( 4,384 days ) and his senate service ( 11,199 days ) , we would double - count 1 / 3 / 1953 ; so we add the days of service in each chamber ( 15,583 days ) and subtract one day from that sum for jackson's total days of congressional service ( 15,582 days ) .

alternately , we could simply count the days from when his house service started through the date of the day when his senate service ended .

samuel smith served in the house , then in the senate , then again in the house , and then once again in the senate .

his first period of service ( in the house ) did not overlap with the second ( in the senate ) .

there was a break between his first period of senate service and his second period of house service , but there is an overlapping day ( 12 / 17 / 1822 ) when he moved finally from the house again to the senate .

accordingly , we add the days of each period of service and subtract one day from the sum for a total of 14,276 days of congressional service .

 table 1 draws the dates of congressional service from the biographical directory of the united states congress , 1774-present ; the "table of united states senators" in u.s. congress , senate , senate manual , s. doc .

104-1 ; and various editions of the congressional directory ( washington: gpo ) .

when a date in the biographical directory was unclear , crs consulted other sources for clarification , as shown in notes to table 1 .
