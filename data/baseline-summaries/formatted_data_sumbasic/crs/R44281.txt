this report provides information and analysis on the following: background on a "bds" ( boycott , divestment , and sanctions ) movement against israel .

private economic measures and product labeling policies — including those of the united states and european union ( eu ) — that "differentiate" between ( 1 ) israel in general and ( 2 ) entities linked with israeli - developed areas and settlements in the west bank , east jerusalem , and golan heights ( areas that israel has controlled and administered since the 1967 arab - israeli war ) .

anti - bds or antidifferentiation efforts to date , including federal and state legislation and proposals .

legislative considerations arising from existing antiboycott law , first amendment issues , and issues regarding congressional powers over commerce and foreign affairs .

congress and the trump administration currently face a number of policy questions on these issues .

the bds movement exists within a larger context of israel's complex economic and political relations with the world .

for more information , see crs report rl33476 , israel: background and u.s. relations , by [author name scrubbed] .

debates regarding policies that govern the labeling of consumer products imported into the european union and united states from israeli settlements , as well as the broader implications of such policies , have become part of the overall policy discussion regarding bds and differentiation .

for additional analysis of enacted and proposed legislation discussed in this section , see " general antiboycott legislative considerations ," " potential first amendment issues facing laws intended to deter bds activity ," and " federal preemption questions: commerce clause and foreign affairs " below .

the existing u.s. antiboycott regime was largely crafted to address the arab league ( league of arab states ) boycott of israel .

members might consider the extent to which the existing regime could be applied or modified with respect to efforts to address the bds movement .

the arab league boycott has three tiers .

the primary boycott prohibits citizens of an arab league member state from buying from , selling to , or entering into a business contract with either the israeli government or an israeli citizen .

the secondary boycott extends the primary boycott to any entity worldwide that does business in israel .

the tertiary boycott prohibits arab league members and their nationals from doing business with a company that deals with companies that have been blacklisted by the arab league .

in the late 1970s , the united states passed antiboycott legislation establishing a set of civil and criminal penalties to discourage u.s. individuals from cooperating with the arab league boycott .

u.s. antiboycott efforts are targeted at the secondary and tertiary boycotts .

u.s. legislation was enacted to "encourage , and in specified cases , require u.s. firms to refuse to participate in foreign boycotts that the united states does not sanction .

they have the effect of preventing u.s. firms from being used to implement foreign policies of other nations which run counter to u.s .

policy. .

according to the department of commerce , in fy2016 , 549 requests by arab league members to participate in the boycott were reported to u.s. officials .

the majority ( 325 requests ) were from the united arab emirates , followed by qatar ( 73 ) and iraq ( 54 ) .

participating in the bds movement would not appear to place a u.s. organization in violation of existing federal antiboycott legislation , which targets organizations' participation in foreign boycotts .

no foreign state has proclaimed that it participates in the bds movement , and the movement does not have a secondary tier targeting companies that do business in or with israel .

some members of congress have introduced legislation seeking to extend existing antiboycott penalties to bds - related activity .

if enacted , the israel anti - boycott act ( s. 720 , h.r .

1697 — see table 1 ) would amend federal antiboycott legislation to also apply to boycotts fostered by international governmental organizations against israel .

members might also consider legal and regulatory frameworks that congress and the executive branch have used to designate actors of concern under various rubrics having to do with trade and / or national security .

one option would be to create a dual system under which congress could explicitly designate foreign bds "offenders" ( either individuals or entities ) through legislation , while also authorizing executive branch agencies ( including the state , treasury , or commerce departments ) to designate foreign "offenders" via case - by - case determinations based on a number of criteria .

such criteria could include market behavior and its impact or potential impact on israel , evidence of intent , coordination with other parties , etc .

congress could require the executive branch to justify its designations / nondesignations through reports , either as a matter of course or upon congressional or congressional leadership request .

such congressional designation measures , however , could raise bill of attainder concerns under the constitution , as well as definitional concerns in identifying bds participation .

as discussed above , opponents of the bds movement have proposed the enactment of legislation , either at the federal or u.s. state level , that would limit or deter participation in bds - related activities and / or economic "differentiation" ( between israel and israeli settlements ) .

these proposals have taken a number of forms .

for instance , an early iteration of congressional legislation would have restricted the availability of federal funds to entities , including universities , which engaged in bds activity .

more recently , some states have enacted laws that prohibit government contractors from boycotting or discriminating against countries including israel .

other states have taken action to restrict the investment of state funds in entities that engage in bds activity .

under these restrictions , state pension funds , for example , may be required to divest from companies engaged in bds activity .

some scholars and commentators have argued that legislation and other government action designed to deter or eliminate bds activity potentially would raise first amendment concerns , while others have argued that such action would be consistent with the first amendment or would not implicate the first amendment at all .

this section discusses key concepts and precedents that might factor into a reviewing court's analysis of the constitutionality of certain proposed and enacted laws and executive actions related to bds activity .

in sum , the degree to which a restriction on bds activity would implicate the first amendment and whether , even if it did , it would nonetheless be permissible turns on a number of unsettled questions .

the first and most obvious is whether the act of refusing to deal with israel or israeli - affiliated entities is expressive conduct protected by the first amendment .

important to this analysis may be whether those participating in bds activity are attempting to make a political statement or are attempting to gain an economic advantage .

another relevant factor may be whether the government , in enacting the restriction , may be viewed by a reviewing court to be suppressing a disfavored message or , instead , to be regulating discriminatory conduct .

answers to these questions would likely turn on the text of the specific statutes at issue , as well as a number of other factors that may be difficult to predict .

as noted above , some state and local governments have enacted or are considering measures to counteract bds - related or differentiation measures .

state and local economic sanctions meant to influence foreign politics ordinarily raise three related constitutional issues: ( 1 ) whether they are preempted by federal law under the constitution's supremacy clause ; ( 2 ) whether they burden foreign commerce in violation of the dormant foreign commerce clause and , if so , whether they are protected by the market participant exception ; and ( 3 ) whether they impermissibly interfere with the federal government's exclusive power to conduct the nation's foreign affairs .

the constitutionality of any given state or local measure would depend upon the particulars of the legislation at issue .

the supremacy clause of the constitution establishes that federal statutes , treaties , and the constitution itself are "the supreme law of the land. .

accordingly , states can be precluded from taking actions that are otherwise within their authority if federal law is thereby impeded .

the extent to which a federal statute preempts state law in a given area is within the control of congress .

congress may , by clearly stating its intent , choose to preempt all state laws , no state laws , or only those state laws with certain attributes .

when congress enacted the antiboycott provisions of the export administration act ( eaa ) in 1977 , for example , it expressly preempted any state or local measure that "pertains to participation in , compliance with , implementation of , or the furnishing of information regarding restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries. .

even absent an express preemption provision such as that found in the eaa , an act of congress can impliedly preempt state or local action .

where congress has not expressly preempted state and local laws , two types of implied federal preemption may be found: field preemption , in which federal regulation is so pervasive that one can reasonably infer that states or localities have no role to play , and conflict preemption , in which "compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility," or where the state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress. .

the supreme court felled a massachusetts law on the latter ground because the law imposed sanctions on burma ( myanmar ) in such a way that frustrated the implementation of a federal statutory scheme also targeting burma .

in order to preclude implied preemption , congress may sometimes include nonpreemption language in sanctions legislation .

one bill in the 115 th congress has been introduced to preserve state and local anti - bds or antidifferentiation measures .

the combating bds act of 2017 , s. 170 ( see table 1 ) , would permit state and local governments to divest their own assets from or prohibit government contracting with certain entities that they determine engage in bds - related activity , as defined by the bill and subject to its restrictions .

the bill appears to be modeled on section 3 of the sudan accountability and divestment act of 2007 , which provides that certain state and local actions targeting sudan are not preempted by any federal law .

the constitution provides congress with the authority to regulate both interstate and foreign commerce .

in addition to this affirmative grant of constitutional authority , the supreme court has recognized that the commerce clause implies a corresponding restraint on the authority of the states to interfere with commerce , even absent congressional action .

this inferred restriction arising from congressional inaction is generally referred to as the "dormant" commerce clause .

under this established principle , states and localities are prohibited from unreasonably burdening or discriminating against either interstate or foreign commerce unless they are authorized by congress to do so .

in a series of cases involving state taxes , the supreme court has set out criteria for examining whether state measures impermissibly burden foreign commerce where affirmative congressional permission is absent .

in sum , the court has required a closer examination of measures alleged to infringe the foreign commerce clause than is required for those alleged to infringe its interstate counterpart , but has also provided some room for state measures in situations where a federal role is not clearly demanded .

where congress has not clearly immunized a state selective purchasing or divestment law , a state may defend a challenged law by invoking the market participant doctrine , which protects those laws in which the state or local government acts as a buyer or seller of goods rather than as a regulator .

consequently , state and local measures that pertain to the investment of government funds , as well as measures that regulate government procurement , may be defended on the ground that the state or local government is merely making investment or purchasing choices for itself and not regulating other investors or buyers , as the case may be .

the market participant doctrine , however , may not apply where the state seeks to affect behavior beyond the immediate market in which it is operating ; the doctrine does not immunize laws from other constitutional challenges ; and the supreme court has suggested the doctrine may not even apply in foreign commerce clause cases .

"power over external affairs is not shared by the states ; it is vested in the national government exclusively. .

consequently , state or local laws that encroach on the federal government's authority over foreign affairs may be deemed constitutionally impermissible .

in its 1968 decision in zschernig v. miller , the supreme court struck down an oregon law prohibiting nonresident aliens from inheriting property unless they could demonstrate to the oregon state courts that their home countries allowed u.s. nationals to inherit estates on a reciprocal basis and that payments to foreign heirs from the oregon estates would not be confiscated .

although the federal government had not exercised its power in the area , the supreme court nonetheless found that the inquiries required by the oregon statute would result in "an intrusion by the state into the field of foreign affairs which the constitution entrusts to the president and the congress. .

the court distinguished an earlier decision , clark v. allen , which had upheld a similar california statute on the ground that the statute in that case could be implemented through "a routine reading of foreign law" and did not require the particularized inquiries demanded by the oregon statute .

the supreme court reaffirmed zschernig and the dormant foreign affairs power in 2003 when it struck down a california law requiring insurers to report life insurance policies held by holocaust victims because the law interfered with an executive agreement supporting a german initiative to resolve holocaust insurance claims without litigation .

it appears to be an open question whether congress can permit state and local regulations that conflict with federal foreign policy , or whether states and localities that enact such measures can invoke a "market participation" exception to shield them from challenges on foreign policy grounds .

prior to enactment of the sudan accountability and divestment act of 2007 , a federal district court enjoined enforcement of an illinois law that prohibited the deposit of state or municipal funds in any financial institution that does business in or with sudan , on the basis that the law interfered with the federal government's dormant foreign policy power .

it does not appear that any court has yet addressed whether the nonpreemption language in the sudan accountability and divestment act of 2007 would effectively shield similar state laws from legal challenges .
