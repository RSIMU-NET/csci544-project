president trump and various u.s. lawmakers have expressed concerns about u.s. reliance on critical mineral imports and the vulnerability to critical mineral disruptions of supply chains for various end uses , including defense and electronics applications .

chinese export quotas on a type of critical minerals referred to as rare earth elements ( rees ) and china's curtailment of rare earth shipments to japan over a maritime dispute in 2010 represented a wakeup call for the united states on china's near - monopoly control over global ree supply .

the actions of the chinese led to record high prices for rees and , as a result , began to shine a light on the potential supply risks and supply chain vulnerability for rare earths and other raw materials and metals needed for national defense , energy technologies , and the electronics industry , among other end uses .

u.s. legislators have introduced and deliberated on bills that would address the potential supply risk and vulnerability with respect to rare earth supply and bills that would promote domestic rare earth mine development .

after 2010 , decisionmakers were faced with various policy questions , including is a domestic supply chain necessary to address potential supply risk ; and would an rre alternative supply chain outside china among allies provide reliable and less risky access to rres ? .

as events unfolded during the 2010s , it became clear that providing an upstream supply outside china was not enough , and that access to and the reliability of entire supply chains for rare earths and other minerals essential for the economy and national security also were vulnerable .

the concern among many in congress has evolved from rare earths and ree supply chains , to also include other minor minerals or metals that used in small quantities for a variety of economically significant applications .

these minor metals are used in relatively small amounts in everyday applications such as laptops , cell phones and electric vehicles , and renewable energy technologies , in addition to national defense applications .

in december 2017 , the presidential executive order ( e.o. ) .

13817 , "a federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals," tasked the department of the interior ( doi ) to coordinate with other executive branch agencies to publish a list of "critical minerals. .

doi published a final list of 35 critical minerals in may 2018 .

minerals for national security have long been a concern in the united states .

for example , there were concerns over shortages of lead for bullets during the early 1800s .

there were material shortages during wwii and the korean war that contributed to the formation of the national defense stockpile .

the current stockpile of strategic and critical minerals and materials was developed to address national emergencies related to national security and defense issues ; it was not established as an economic stockpile .

in 1939 , after germany invaded poland , the strategic materials act of 1939 ( 50 u.s.c .

â§98 , p.l .

76-117 ) provided the authority for the united states to establish a strategic materials stockpile .

then in 1946 , the strategic and critical materials stockpiling act was enacted so that the united states would be prepared for national military emergencies and to prevent material shortages .

the 1946 act ( p.l .

79-520 ) set a target of $2.1 billion of materials to be spent for the stockpile .

congress increased funding for supplying the stockpile to $4 billion over four years ( 1950-1953 ) .

the defense production act of 1950 ( 50 u.s.c .

â§4501 , p.l.81-774 ) added $8.4 billion to expand supplies of strategic and critical materials .

in 1951 , president truman formed the materials policy commission ( also known as the paley commission ) which recommended a stockpile for strategic materials and the use of lower cost foreign sources of supply .

president eisenhower established long term stockpile goals during a national emergency as a way to prevent the shortages that occurred during world war ii and the korean war .

the initial time frame for the duration of the emergency the stockpile was intended to cover was three years , but later reduced to one year .

however , with the passage of the 1979 strategic and critical minerals stockpiling revision act ( p.l .

96-41 ) , a three - year military contingency was reestablished as a criterion for stockpile goals .

funding for the stockpile was subsequently increased to $20 billion .

during the cold - war era , the national defense stockpile ( nds ) had an inventory of large quantities of strategic and critical materials .

in the early 1990s , after the cold war with the soviet union , the u.s. congress supported an upgrade and modernization of the strategic materials stockpile .

by fy1993 , the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 1993 ( p.l .

102-484 ) authorized a major sell - off of 44 obsolete and excess materials in the stockpile such as aluminum metal , ferrochromium , ferromanganese , cobalt , nickel , silver , tin , and zinc .

the majority of these materials were sold to the private sector .

proceeds of these sales were transferred to other federal or department of defense ( dod ) programs .

materials analysis is a useful tool to better understand various aspects of mineral demand .

for example , such analysis can provide information on how material inputs are used in component parts and how components are used in larger systems such as solar arrays , wind turbines , and automobiles .

using a material analysis , an analyst can obtain information on the material intensity of a unit of production .

this analysis can lead to manufacturing efficiencies ( i.e. , getting the same or better performance using fewer materials ) or show where and how material substitution , if possible , could occur .

manufacturing firms could then make short - term or long - term adjustments to their production processes .

even with materials efficiencies , where less metal is used per unit of output , overall demand growth and lack of short - term supply capacity often drives up mineral prices .

for example , households in some countries are likely to have multiple units of a variety of products such as laptops , flat panel televisions , and cell phones , etc .

and because the materials intensity ( small amounts per unit output ) of critical minerals is relatively low for most end - use applications , low - cost manufactured goods may contain some high - cost materials .

the remainder of this section of the report provides information on the materials content of lithium - ion batteries , solar energy arrays , wind technologies , and permanent magnets , with a more detailed discussion of the material requirements for wind and solar energy systems .

with a supply chain analysis , it is just as important to know where new downstream capacity ( processing , refining , and metals alloying ) is being built or likely to be built in the world as it is to know the likely investors in upstream production capacity for critical minerals .

when looking at the complete supply picture it could be more easily determined where the potential risks are and what mitigation efforts may be available .

below , two illustrative supply chains are described: rare earth elements and tantalum .

this section provides a discussion of selected policy options related to critical minerals that were included in legislation introduced in the 115 th and 116 th congresses .

in addition to weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the various policy options discussed above and below , policymakers have the option of maintaining the status quo of current policies .

the usgs could establish a minerals information administration for information and analysis on the global mineral / metal supply and demand picture .

companies producing minerals on public lands could be required to report production data to the federal agency .

encouragement of greater exploration for critical minerals in the united states , australia , africa , and canada could be part of a broad international strategy .

there are only a few companies in the world that can provide the exploration and development skills and technology for critical mineral development .

these few companies are located primarily in the above four regions and china , and may form joint ventures or other types of alliances for r&d , and for exploration and development of critical mineral deposits worldwide , including those in the united states .

whether there should be restrictions on these cooperative efforts in the united states is a question for congressional deliberations .

other action by congress could include oversight of free trade issues associated with critical mineral supply .

two raw material issues associated with china export restrictions were taken up by the world trade organization ( wto ) .

one case , settled in 2011 , was filed by the united states against china and was related to restrictions on bauxite , magnesium , manganese , silicon metal , and zinc , among others ( using export quotas and export taxes ) .

the other case , resolved in 2012 , was filed by the united states , japan , and the european union on export restrictions of rare earth oxides , tungsten , and molybdenum .

the wto ruled against china in both cases , concluding that china did not show the link between conservation of resources or environmental protection ( and protection of public health ) and the need for export restrictions .

the united states could support more trade missions ; support u.s. commercial delegations to china and other mineral - producing countries ; and assist smaller and less - developed countries in improving their governance capacity .

although there are concerns that trade tariffs with china could impact the prices and availability of critical minerals and downstream metals imported from china , the effects would depend on the specifics of the tariffs as well as the particular mineral and metal involved .

in china and other emerging economies , economic development will continue to have a major impact on the world supply and availability of raw materials and downstream products .

various countries may be faced with making adjustments to secure needed raw materials , metals , and finished goods for national security and economic development .

china , japan , and others are already actively engaged in securing reliable mineral supplies .

many firms have moved to china to gain access to its market , raw materials , or intermediate products , and generally lower - cost minerals production .

at the same time , china is seeking technology transfer from many of these firms to expand its downstream manufacturing capacity .

despite china's current overcapacity and increased exports of some commodities , in the long run it may be in china's interest to use its minerals ( plus imports ) for domestic manufacturing of higher - valued downstream products ( eg , component parts and consumer electronics ) .

higher - cost , inefficient facilities and mines may close , resulting in china seeking more imports as mining industry consolidations are implemented .

the effects on china's dominance in the supply and demand of global raw materials could be addressed in part through consistent development of alternate sources of supply , use of alternative materials when possible , efficiency gains , aggressive r&d in development of new technologies , and comprehensive minerals information to support this effort .

china is likely entering an era of fewer raw material exports which may instigate long - term planning by the private sector and government entities that want to meet u.s. national security , economic , and energy policy interests and challenges .

some stakeholders may seek to have some concerns addressed through the wto .

additional questions that may be deliberated by congress include how long would it take to develop the skill set in the united states for downstream manufacturing activities ? .

would an international educational exchange program with those countries already involved in the refining and recycling of critical minerals be appropriate ? .

more analysis would be useful to investigate u.s. firms' capacity to adjust to supply bottlenecks such as restrictions in other countries' exports , underinvestment in capacity , materials use in other countries and domestically , single source issues , strikes , power outages , natural disasters , political risk , and lack of substitutes .

having such analysis and understanding may inform public policy .

more information could inform deliberations as congress and other policymakers evaluate the available policy options and their effectiveness at minimizing the risk of potential supply interruption of critical and strategic minerals and metals .
