the 116 th congress continues its interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .

the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites , shale gas extraction , and defenses against disease .

in recent years , federal budget caps have driven executive and legislative branch decisions about the prioritization of r&d , both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal r&d portfolio .

the bipartisan budget act of 2019 , among other things , increased the previously established fy2020 and fy2021 discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending .

this act reduced some of the budgetary constraints affecting r&d decisions .

the u.s. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering r&d .

its purposes include addressing national defense , health , safety , the environment , and energy security ; advancing knowledge generally ; developing the scientific and engineering workforce ; and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .

most of the r&d funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies .

the federal r&d budget is an aggregation of the r&d activities of these agencies .

there is no single , centralized source of r&d funds .

agency r&d budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process .

r&d funding may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to r&d or in accounts that also include funding for non - r&d activities .

agency budgets are subjected to review , revision , and approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and become part of the president's annual budget submission to congress .

the federal r&d budget is then calculated by aggregating the r&d activities of each federal agency .

congress plays a central role in defining the nation's r&d priorities as it makes decisions about the level and allocation of r&d fundingâoverall , within agencies , and for specific programs .

in recent years , some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the federal deficit and debt .

other members of congress have expressed support for increased federal spending for r&d as an investment in the nation's future competitiveness .

as congress acts to complete the fy2021 appropriations process , it faces two overarching issues: the amount of the federal budget to be spent on federal r&d and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding .

this report begins with a discussion of the overall level of r&d in president trump's fy2021 budget request , followed by analyses of r&d funding in the request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency r&d initiatives .

the remainder of the report discusses and analyzes the r&d budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that , collectively , account for approximately 98% of total federal r&d funding .

selected terms associated with federal r&d funding are defined in the text box on the next page .

appendix a provides a list of acronyms and abbreviations .

on february 10 , 2020 , president trump released his proposed fy2021 budget .

president trump is proposing $142.2 billion for r&d for fy2021 , a decrease of $13.8 billion ( 8.8% ) below the fy2020 level of $156.0 billion .

adjusted for inflation to fy2021 dollars , the president's fy2021 r&d request represents a constant - dollar decrease of 10.6% from the fy2020 actual level .

the president's request includes continued r&d funding for existing single - agency and multiagency programs and activities , as well as new initiatives .

this report provides government - wide , multiagency , and individual agency analyses of the president's fy2021 request as it relates to r&d and related activities .

additional information and analysis will be included as the house and senate act on the president's budget request through appropriations bills .

it is not yet clear how the national response to the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic will affect administration and congressional priorities for fy2021 r&d funding , or the congressional authorization and appropriations processes for enacting that funding .

federal r&d funding can be analyzed from a variety of perspectives that provide different insights .

the following sections examine the data by agency , by the character of the work supported , and by a combination of these two perspectives .

for many years , presidential budgets have reported on multiagency r&d initiatives .

often , they have also provided details of agency funding for these initiatives .

some of these efforts have a statutory basisâfor example , the networking and information technology research and development ( nitrd ) program , the national nanotechnology initiative ( nni ) , and the u.s .

global change research program ( usgcrp ) .

these programs generally produce annual budget supplements identifying objectives , activities , funding levels , and other information , usually published shortly after the presidential budget release .

other multiagency r&d initiatives have operated at the discretion of the president , without such a basis , and may be eliminated at the discretion of the president .

president trump's fy2021 budget is largely silent on funding levels for these efforts and whether any or all of the nonstatutory initiatives will continue .

some activities related to these initiatives are discussed in agency budget justifications and may be addressed in the agency analyses later in this report .

this section provides available multiagency information on these initiatives and will be updated as additional information becomes available .

the mission of the department of defense is to provide "the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our nation's security. .

congress supports research and development activities at dod primarily through the department's research , development , test , and evaluation ( rdt&e ) funding .

these funds support the development of the nation's future military hardware and software and the science and technology base upon which those products rely .

most of what dod spends on rdt&e is appropriated in title iv of the annual defense appropriations bill .

 ( see table 7 . ) .

title iv rdt&e funds support activities such as r&d performed by academic institutions , dod laboratories , and companies , as well as test and evaluation activities at specialized dod facilities , among other things .

however , rdt&e funds are also appropriated in other parts of the bill .

for example , rdt&e funds are appropriated as part of the defense health program , the chemical agents and munitions destruction program , and the national defense sealift fund .

the defense health program ( dhp ) supports the delivery of health care to dod personnel and their families .

dhp funds ( including the rdt&e funds ) are requested through the defense - wide operations and maintenance appropriations request .

the program's rdt&e funds support congressionally directed research on breast , prostate , and ovarian cancer ; traumatic brain injuries ; orthotics and prosthetics ; and other medical conditions .

congress appropriates funds for this program in title vi ( other department of defense programs ) of the defense appropriations bill .

the chemical agents and munitions destruction program supports activities to destroy the u.s. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage .

funds for this program are requested through the defense - wide procurement appropriations request .

congress appropriates funds for this program also in title vi .

the national defense sealift fund supports the procurement , operation and maintenance , and research and development associated with the nation's naval reserve fleet and supports a u.s. flagged merchant fleet that can serve in time of need .

in some fiscal years , rdt&e funding for this effort is requested in the navy's procurement request and appropriated in title v ( revolving and management funds ) of the appropriations bill .

rdt&e funds also have been requested and appropriated as part of dod's separate funding to support efforts in what the george w. bush administration termed the global war on terror ( gwot ) and what the obama and trump administrations have referred to as overseas contingency operations ( oco ) .

in appropriations bills , the term overseas contingency operations / global war on terror ( oco / gwot ) has been used ; president trump's fy2021 budget uses the term overseas contingency operations .

typically , the rdt&e funds appropriated for oco activities go to specified program elements ( pes ) in title iv .

according to the comptroller of the department of defense , the fy2021 oco request is divided into two requirement categoriesâdirect and enduring war , and oco for base requirements .

for purposes of this report , these categories of oco funding requests are reported collectively .

in addition , oco / gwot - related requests / appropriations have included money for a number of transfer funds .

in the past , these have included the iraqi freedom fund ( iff ) , the iraqi security forces fund , the afghanistan security forces fund , and the pakistan counterinsurgency capability fund .

congress typically has made a single appropriation into each such fund and authorized the secretary of defense to make transfers to other accounts , including rdt&e , at his discretion .

these transfers are eventually reflected in title iv prior - year funding figures .

for fy2021 , the trump administration is requesting $106.555 billion for dod's title iv rdt&e pes ( base plus oco ) , $1.159 billion ( 1.1% ) above the enacted fy2020 level .

 ( see table 7 . ) .

in addition , the fy2021 request includes $562.5 million in rdt&e through the defense health program ( dhp ; down $1.744 billion , 75.6% from fy2020 ) , $782.2 million in rdt&e through the chemical agents and munitions destruction program ( down $93.7 million , 10.7% from fy2020 ) , and $1.1 million for the inspector general for rdt&e - related activities ( down $1.9 million , 63.0% from fy2020 ) .

the fy2021 budget includes no rdt&e funding via the national defense sealift fund , the same as the fy2020 enacted level .

rdt&e funding can be analyzed in different ways .

rdt&e funding can be characterized organizationally .

each military department requests and receives its own rdt&e funding .

so , too , do various dod agencies ( eg , the missile defense agency and the defense advanced research projects agency ) , collectively aggregated within the defense - wide account .

rdt&e funding also can be characterized by budget activity ( i.e. , the type of rdt&e supported ) .

those budget activities designated as 6.1 , 6.2 , and 6.3 ( basic research , applied research , and advanced technology development , respectively ) constitute what is called dod's science and technology ( s&t ) program and represent the more research - oriented part of the rdt&e program .

budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established .

budget activity 6.6 provides management support , including support for test and evaluation facilities .

budget activity 6.7 supports the development of system improvements in existing operational systems .

budget activity 6.8 was added in the fy2021 budget and supports software and digital technology pilot programs .

many congressional policymakers are particularly interested in dod s&t program funding , since these funds support the development of new technologies and the science that underlies them .

some in the defense community see ensuring adequate support for s&t activities as imperative to maintaining u.s. military superiority into the future .

the knowledge generated at this stage of development may also contribute to advances in commercial technologies .

the fy2021 request for title iv s&t funding ( base plus oco ) is $14.070 billion , $1.991 billion ( 12.4% ) below the fy2020 enacted level .

within the s&t program , basic research ( 6.1 ) receives special attention , particularly by the nation's universities , as over half of dod's basic research budget is spent at universities .

the trump administration is requesting $2.319 billion for dod basic research for fy2021 , $284.2 million ( 10.9% ) below the fy2020 enacted level .

while dod is not the largest federal funder of basic research , it is a substantial source of federal funds for university r&d in certain fields , such as aerospace , aeronautical , and astronautical engineering ( 60% ) ; electrical , electronic , and communications engineering ( 58% ) ; industrial and manufacturing engineering ( 48% ) ; mechanical engineering ( 46% ) ; computer and information sciences ( 44% ) ; metallurgical and materials engineering ( 39% ) ; and materials science ( 33% ) .

the mission of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is "to enhance and protect the health and well - being of all americans ... by providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine , public health , and social services. .

this section focuses on hhs research and development funded through the national institutes of health ( nih ) , an hhs agency that accounts for nearly 97% of total hhs r&d funding .

other hhs agencies that support r&d include the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , food and drug administration ( fda ) , agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , and administration for children and families ( acf ) ; additional r&d funding is attributed to departmental management .

the department of energy was established in 1977 by the department of energy organization act ( p.l .

95-91 ) , which combined energy - related programs from a variety of agencies with defense - related nuclear programs that dated back to the manhattan project .

today , doe conducts basic scientific research in fields ranging from nuclear physics to the biological and environmental sciences ; basic and applied r&d relating to energy production and use ; and r&d on nuclear weapons , nuclear nonproliferation , and defense nuclear reactors .

the department has a system of 17 national laboratories around the country , mostly operated by contractors , that together account for about 40% of all doe expenditures .

the administration's fy2021 budget request for doe includes about $13.853 billion for r&d and related activities , including programs in three broad categories: science , national security , and energy .

this request is about 19.1% less than the comparable enacted fy2020 amount of $17.124 billion .

 ( see table 9 for details. ) .

the request for the doe office of science is $5.838 billion , a decrease of 16.6% from the fy2020 appropriation of $7.000 billion .

funding would decrease for five of the office's six major research programs .

in the largest program , basic energy sciences , almost two - thirds of the proposed 16.6% decrease would result from spending less on facility construction .

most of the remainder would result from spending less on existing scientific user facilities , in some cases by reducing hours of operation .

funding for biological and environmental research would decrease by 31.1% , with reductions concentrated in the earth and environmental systems sciences subprogram as proposed in other recent administration budgets .

funding for fusion energy sciences would decrease by 36.6% .

within fusion energy sciences , the u.s. contribution to construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor ( iter ) , a fusion energy demonstration and research facility in france , would be $107 million ( down from $242 million in fy2020 ) .

the one major research program receiving an increase would be advanced scientific computing research ( up 0.8% ) .

within advanced scientific computing research , an increase of $109 million for research would be partly offset by a decrease of $81 million for facilities ; the office of science exascale computing project would receive $169 million , down from $189 million in fy2020 .

the request for doe national security r&d is $5.066 billion , an increase of 6.3% from $4.765 billion in fy2020 .

in weapons activities , the request for stockpile research , technology , and engineering would be an increase of 9.0% above the comparable fy2020 amount .

the bulk of the increase would be for assessment science ( $773 million , up from $595 million in fy2020 ) and weapon technology and manufacturing maturation ( $298 million , up from $222 million in fy2020 ) .

a proposed increase of 7.2% for r&d in the defense nuclear nonproliferation account reflects $40 million requested for a program in national technical nuclear forensics r&d , formerly funded in dhs .

the request for doe energy r&d is $2.949 billion , a decrease of 45.0% from $5.360 billion in fy2020 .

many of the proposed reductions in this category are similar to the administration's fy2019 and fy2020 budget proposals .

funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy r&d would decrease by 70.1% , with reductions in all major research areas and a shift in emphasis toward early - stage r&d rather than later - stage development and deployment .

in the fossil energy r&d account , an increase of $172 million for advanced energy systems would be largely offset by decreases for carbon capture , utilization , and storage ( $123 million , down from $218 million in fy2020 ) , natural gas technologies ( $15 million , down from $51 million ) , and oil technologies ( $17 million , down from $46 million ) .

the request for nuclear fuel cycle r&d is $187 million ( down from $305 million ) , and nuclear energy as a whole would decrease by 20.1% , with no funding requested for the integrated university program ( $5 million in fy2020 ) or the supercritical transformational electric power ( step ) r&d initiative ( $5 million in fy2020 ) .

the advanced research projects agency - energy ( arpa - e ) , which is intended to advance high - impact energy technologies that have too much technical and financial uncertainty to attract near - term private - sector investment , would be terminated .

the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) was created in 1958 by the national aeronautics and space act ( p.l .

85-568 ) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities .

nasa has research programs in planetary science , earth science , heliophysics , astrophysics , and aeronautics , as well as development programs for future human spacecraft and for multipurpose space technology such as advanced propulsion systems .

in addition , nasa operates the international space station ( iss ) as a facility for r&d and other purposes .

the administration has requested about $22.243 billion for nasa r&d in fy2021 .

this would be 14.4% more than the fy2020 level of about $19.439 billion .

for a breakdown of these amounts , see table 10 .

nasa r&d funding comes through five accounts: science ; aeronautics ; space technology ( called exploration technology in the administration's budget request ) ; exploration ( deep space exploration systems in the request ) ; and the iss , commercial crew , and commercial low earth orbit ( leo ) development portions of space operations ( called leo and spaceflight operations in the request ) .

the omb figures presented in table 1 indicate a substantially smaller amount for nasa r&d than the figures presented in this section , and a decrease in the fy2021 request relative to fy2020 rather than an increase .

the main reason for this appears to be that omb treats only about half of the exploration account as r&d ( somewhat more than half in fy2020 , somewhat less than half in fy2021 ) .

as systems being developed under that account move from r&d to testing and ultimately operations , the share of the account spent on r&d may decrease .

in order to allow consistent tracking as congress acts on fy2021 appropriations legislation , this section treats the entirety of the exploration account as r&d .

the fy2021 request for science is $6.307 billion , a decrease of 11.7% from fy2020 .

within this total , funding for earth science would decrease by $204 million ( 10.4% ) and funding for astrophysics would decrease by $475 million ( 36.4% ) .

in earth science , the administration proposes to terminate the pre - aerosol , clouds , and ocean ecosystem ( pace ) and climate absolute radiance and refractivity observatory ( clarreo ) pathfinder missions ( $131 million and $26 million respectively in fy2020 ) .

in astrophysics , it proposes to terminate the wide field infrared space telescope ( wfirst ) and stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) missions ( $511 million and $85 million in fy2020 ) .

pace and clarreo pathfinder were also proposed for termination in the fy2018 through fy2020 budgets , and wfirst was also proposed for termination in the fy2019 and fy2020 budgets , but in each case they were funded by congress .

the planetary science request includes $404 million ( down from $593 million in fy2020 ) for a mission to orbit jupiter's moon europa .

despite direction otherwise in the fy2020 explanatory statement , the europa mission would be launched on a commercial rocket and would not include a lander .

the fy2021 request for aeronautics is $819 million , an increase of 4.5% from $784 million in fy2020 .

as projected in prior budgets , the request includes $79 million for the low boom flight demonstrator program , intended to demonstrate quiet supersonic flight .

the fy2021 request for exploration technology ( currently space technology ) is $1.578 billion , an increase of 43.5% from fy2020 .

the combined restore - l / spider mission to demonstrate in - space satellite servicing and robotic manufacturing would receive $134 million ( down from $227 million in fy2020 ) .

a newly integrated space nuclear technologies portfolio would receive $100 million for development of space nuclear power and propulsion technologies .

the budget justification emphasizes exploration technology's support of nasa's artemis human exploration initiative and its plans for a human lunar landing in 2024 .

in contrast , fy2020 congressional report language emphasized "broad technology development goals â¦ independent of mission - specific needs" ( h.rept .

116-101 ) and technologies that "can serve all nasa mission directorates and are not solely focused on enabling human spaceflight" ( s.rept .

116-127 ) .

the fy2021 request for deep space exploration systems ( currently exploration ) is $8.762 billion , an increase of 45.6% from fy2020 .

within this account , the request for exploration systems development includes $1.401 billion for the orion crew capsule ( down from $1.407 billion in fy2020 ) and $2.257 billion for the space launch system heavy - lift rocket ( sls , down from $2.586 billion in fy2020 ) .

the proposed 228.9% increase for exploration r&d reflects a request for $3.370 billion for development of a human lunar landing system .

exploration r&d funding would also include $739 million ( up from $450 million in fy2020 ) for development of the gateway lunar - orbiting platform , intended to support human and robotic missions to the lunar surface .

in the leo and spaceflight operations account ( currently space operations ) , the request includes $1.401 billion for the iss ; $100 million for the commercial crew program ( down from $102 million in fy2020 ) ; and $150 million for commercial leo development ( up from $15 million in fy2020 ) .

commercial crew activities are transitioning from development to operations ( which is funded separately ) ; following additional test flights to obtain safety certification from nasa , the first post - certification crewed commercial flight to the iss is expected during 2020 .

the commercial leo development program , intended to stimulate a commercial space economy in low earth orbit , was initiated in the fy2019 budget .

the administration has requested $150 million for it each year since then ; congress has so far appropriated a total of $55 million .

the national science foundation supports basic research and education in the nonmedical sciences and engineering .

congress established the foundation as an independent federal agency in 1950 and directed it to "promote the progress of science ; to advance the national health , prosperity , and welfare ; to secure the national defense ; and for other purposes. .

the nsf is a primary source of federal support for u.s. university research , especially in computer science , biology , mathematics and the social and psychological sciences .

it is also responsible for significant shares of the federal science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) education program portfolio and federal stem student aid and support .

nsf has six appropriations accounts: research and related activities ( rra , the main research account ) , education and human resources ( ehr , the main education account ) , major research equipment and facilities construction ( mrefc ) , agency operations and award management ( aoam ) , the national science board ( nsb ) , and the office of inspector general ( oig ) .

appropriations are generally provided at the account level , while program - specific direction may be included in appropriations acts , or accompanying conference reports or explanatory statements .

funding for r&d is included in the rra , ehr , and mrefc accounts .

 ( the rra and ehr accounts also include non - r&d funding. ) .

together , these three accounts comprise over 95% of the total requested funding for nsf .

actual r&d obligations for each account are known after nsf allocates funding appropriations to specific activities and reports those figures .

the budget request specifies r&d funding for the conduct of research , including basic and applied research , and for physical assets , including r&d facilities and major equipment .

funding amounts for fy2019 actual and fy2021 requested levels are reported by account , including amounts for r&d conduct and physical assets where applicable , in table 11 .

funding for nsf for fy2020 was enacted on december 20 , 2019 .

funding details below the account level were not available at the time the fy2021 budget request was prepared .

therefore , at the account level , the fy2021 request amounts are compared to the fy2020 enacted amounts , as well as to the fy2019 actual amounts in this analysis ; below the account level and for r&d totals , the fy2021 request amounts are compared to fy2019 actual amounts .

this section will be updated when fy2020 r&d breakouts and subaccount funding amounts are available for comparison .

fy2019 actual , fy2020 enacted , and fy2021 requested amounts are reported by account in table 11 ; funding for r&d conduct and facilities and equipment is included for fy2021 requested and fy2019 actual amounts .

overall .

the administration is requesting $7.741 billion for the nsf in fy2021 , $537 million ( 6.5% ) less than the fy2020 enacted amount , and $409 million ( 5.0% ) less than the fy2019 actual amount .

the request would decrease budget authority in all three of the r&d accounts relative to the fy2020 enacted level: rra by $524 million ( 7.8% ) , ehr by $9.1 million ( 1.0% ) , and mrefc by $13.5 million ( 5.5% ) .

overall , nsf estimates that , under the fy2021 request , agency - wide funding rates ( i.e. , the percentage of submitted proposals that are successfully awarded funding ) would decrease slightly from 27% to 25% , with 500 fewer new competitive awards , compared to fy2019 .

as a proportion of nsf's total funding , r&d activities account for approximately 80% .

for fy2021 , $6.33 billion is requested for r&d activities , a 4.8% decrease from fy2019 actual funding for r&d of $6.65 billion .

the total request includes $5.80 billion ( 92% ) for the conduct of r&d , and $523 million ( 8% ) for r&d facilities and major equipment .

of funding requested for the conduct of r&d , 86% is requested for basic research , and 14% for applied research .

overall funding for r&d facilities and major equipment supports not only the construction and acquisition phases , funded through mrefc ( $230 million requested ) , but also the planning , design , and postconstruction operations and maintenance , funded through rra ( $293 million requested ) .

research .

the administration seeks $6.21 billion for rra in fy2021 , a $524 million ( 7.8% ) decrease compared to the fy2020 enacted funding , and a $365 million ( 5.6% ) decrease compared to fy2019 actual funding .

compared to the fy2019 actual levels , the fy2021 request includes decreases for 8 of the 10 rra subaccounts .

the largest percentage decrease would go to the office of polar programs ( 14.1% , down $69 million ) .

the computer and information science and engineering ( cise ) subaccount would receive the largest dollar increase ( 7.8% , up $77 million ) .

the fy2021 request also includes $164 million for the rra established program to stimulate competitive research ( epscor ) program , a $12 million ( 6.8% ) decrease compared to fy2019 actual funding .

within the rra account , the fy2021 request includes $5.61 billion for r&d , a decrease of $284 million ( 4.8% ) compared to the fy2019 actual amount .

of this amount , the majority ( $5.32 billion , 95% ) is requested for the conduct of research , including $4.85 billion for basic research and $469 million for applied research .

education .

the fy2021 request for the ehr account is $931 million , $9.1 million ( 1.0% ) less than the fy2020 enacted amount and $3.6 million ( 0.4% ) less than the fy2019 actual level .

by program division , the division of graduate education would receive an increase of $28.7 million ( 11.3% ) over the fy2019 actual level .

the divisions of research on learning in formal and informal settings , and undergraduate education would receive decreases of 2.1% ( $224 million requested ) , and 10.7% ( $237 million requested ) , respectively .

the division on human resource development would receive approximately the same amount of funding ( $189 million requested ) .

ehr programs of particular interest to congressional policymakers include the graduate research fellowship program ( grfp ) and national research traineeship ( nrt ) programs .

the fy2021 request for grfp is $275 million , a reduction of $9.27 million ( 3.3% ) from the fy2019 actual level .

the fy2021 request for nrt is $61.9 million , a $7.78 million increase ( 14.4% ) from fy2019 .

within ehr , requested funding for r&d is $485 million , which is $17.9 million ( 3.8% ) more than the fy2019 actual funding amount and accounts for approximately 7.7% of the agency's total r&d request .

all of the requested funding would support the conduct of r&d , including $167 million for basic research and $318 million for applied research .

construction .

the mrefc account supports large construction projects and scientific instruments , with all of the funding supporting r&d facilities .

the construction phases of such large - scale projects tend to span multiple years ; therefore , nsf provides out - year estimates of funding for major facilities for the duration of the anticipated timeline , which are updated annually .

this section of the analysis includes comparisons to fy2020 estimated funding , based on these projections .

the administration is seeking $230 million for mrefc in fy2021 , $13.5 million ( 5.5% ) less than the fy2020 enacted amount , and $55.5 million ( 19.5% ) less than the fy2019 actual amount .

requested mrefc funding would support continued construction of the vera c. rubin observatory ( $40.8 million requested , down 12.1% from the fy2020 estimate ) âpreviously called the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) âand the antarctic infrastructure modernization for science project ( aims , $90.0 million requested , down 8.1% from fy2020 estimate ) .

the request includes $33.0 million for upgrades to the large hadron collider in switzerland , which would represent the second year of a five - year project .

additionally , $65.0 million is requested for mid - scale research infrastructure projects ( those projects with funding amounts in the $20 million to $70 million range ) ; this was a new funding line - item in the mrefc account as of fy2020 , meant to manage support for upgrades to major facilities and stand - alone projects in this range as a portfolio .

other initiatives .

the fy2021 nsf budget request includes funding for multiple agency - wide investments , including the big ideas and convergence accelerator , as well as three multiagency initiatives .

this funding is included in multiple nsf appropriations accounts , and r&d amounts are not separately provided .

the big ideas , which include six research and three enabling big ideas , first proposed in 2016 , "endeavor to break down the silos of conventional scientific research â¦ to define and push the frontiers of global science and engineering leadership and to invest in fundamental research. .

requested funding amounts for each of the big ideas compared to the fy2019 actual amounts include the following: harnessing the data revolution for 21 st - century science and engineering ( hdr ) : $45 million requested , up $15 million ( 50% ) from fy2019 .

the future of work at the human technology frontier ( fw - htf ) : $45 million requested , up $15 million ( 50% ) from fy2019 .

the quantum leap ( ql ) : leading the next quantum revolution: $50 million requested , up $20 million ( 67% ) from fy2019 .

navigating the new arctic ( nna ) : $30 million requested , equal to fy2019 .

understanding the rules of life ( urol ) : predicting phenotype: $30 million requested , equal to fy2019 .

windows on the universe ( wou ) : the era of multi - messenger astrophysics: $30 million requested , equal to fy2019 .

inclusion across the nation of communities of learners of underrepresented discoverers in engineering and science ( nsf includes ) : $18.9 million requested , down $1.3 million ( 6.3% ) from fy2019 .

growing convergence research at nsf ( gcr ) : $15.2 million requested , down $0.6 million ( 3.8% ) from fy2019 .

mid - scale research infrastructure: $97.7 million requested , up $37.6 million ( 62.7% ) from fy2019 .

the convergence accelerator ( ca ) is an organizational framework that stands separately from the nsf research directorates , with its own budget , staff , and initiatives .

each ca research track will be a time - limited entity focused on specific research topics and themes .

therefore , ca research tracks will evolve over time and will be informed by external stakeholder input .

the ca will reward high - risk , innovative thinking by multidisciplinary teams of researchers who want to accelerate discovery and innovation .

the ca is a way of achieving rapid lab - to - market or research outcomes .

the initial ca research tracks have focused on a subset of the big ideas , though the ca investments "are distinguished from the corresponding big ideas by the nature of the research , the time scale of the activities supported , and the more hands - on , agile approach to project management and support that is envisioned [by the ca program]. .

nsf has requested $70 million for the ca in fy2021 , which is $28.6 million more than the fy2019 actual amount .

the budget request states that nsf anticipates financial contributions from external partners to begin in fy2021 ( amount unspecified ) .

the budget request also includes three multi - agency initiatives .

the national nanotechnology initiative would receive $454 million , $67.2 million ( 12.9% ) less than in fy2019 .

the networking and information technology research and development program would receive $1.57 billion , an increase of $151 million ( 10.7% ) .

the u.s .

global change research program would receive $217 million , $24 million ( 9.8% ) less than in fy2019 .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) was created in 1862 to support agricultural research in an expanding , agriculturally dependent country .

today , usda conducts intramural research at federal facilities with federally employed scientists and supports extramural research at universities and other facilities through competitive grants and capacity ( formula - based ) funding .

the breadth of contemporary usda research spans traditional agricultural production practices , organic and sustainable agriculture , bioenergy , nutritional needs and food composition , food safety , animal and plant health , pest and disease management , economic decisionmaking , and other social sciences affecting consumers , farmers , and rural communities .

the four agencies of usda's research , education , and economics ( ree ) mission area carry out the department's research and education activities .

these agencies are the agricultural research service ( ars ) , the principal intramural research agency ; the national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) , the principal extramural research agency ; the national agricultural statistics service ( nass ) , which undertakes a variety of surveys to capture relevant data ; and the economic research service ( ers ) , which applies economic analysis to a wide range of topics related to food and agriculture .

in addition to the four ree agencies , the office of the chief scientist ( ocs ) , a staff office within the office of the under secretary of ree , coordinates science activities across the department .

the fy2020 enacted appropriations ( p.l .

116-94 ) provide a total of $3,399.5 million in discretionary spending for the ree agencies .

the administration is requesting a total of $3,248.3 million for these agencies in fy2021 , a 4.4% reduction ( $151.2 million ) .

the administration request reflects a reduction of $189.2 million for ars .

the overall reduction also includes proposed decreases in certain activities at nifa , nass , and ers .

the administration is requesting increases for nifa competitive research grants ( $175.0 million ) and nass's census of agriculture ( $1.0 million ) .

usda's fy2020 enacted discretionary appropriations and the administration's fy2021 request for the four research agencies and ocs are discussed below , with funding amounts presented in table 12 .

in addition to discretionary appropriations , agricultural research is funded by state matching contributions and private donations or grants , as well as certain mandatory funding authorized by the 2018 farm bill ( p.l .

115-334 ) .

two agencies of the department of commerce have major r&d programs: the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) .

the department of veterans affairs operates and maintains a national health care delivery system to provide eligible veterans with medical care , benefits , and social support .

as part of the agency's mission , it seeks to advance medical r&d in areas most relevant to the diseases and conditions that affect the health care needs of veterans .

the president is proposing $1.456 billion for va r&d in fy2021 , an increase of $58 million ( 4% ) from fy2020 enacted levels .

 ( see table 15 . ) .

according to the president's request , fy2021 strategic priorities for va r&d include increasing the access of veterans to clinical trials ; increasing the transfer and translation of va r&d ; and the effective use of va data for veterans .

additionally , crosscutting priorities for va r&d include efforts to treat veterans at risk of suicide and research to address chronic pain and opioid addiction , posttraumatic stress disorder , traumatic brain injury , precision oncology , and gulf war illness and military exposures .

va r&d is funded through two accountsâthe medical and prosthetic research account and the medical care support account .

the medical care support account also includes non - r&d funding , and the amount of funding that will be allocated to support r&d through appropriations legislation is unclear unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels from the medical care support account are only known after the va allocates its appropriations to specific activities and reports those figures .

the fy2021 request includes $787 million for va's medical and prosthetic research account , a decrease of $37 million ( 5% ) compared to fy2020 enacted levels .

the request includes $669 million in funding for research supported by the agency's medical care support account , an increase of $21 million ( 3% ) compared to fy2020 .

the medical care support account provides administrative and other support for va researchers and r&d projects , including infrastructure maintenance .

the medical and prosthetics r&d program is an intramural program managed by the veteran health administration's office of research and development ( ord ) and conducted at va medical centers and va - approved sites nationwide .

according to ord , the mission of va r&d is "to improve veterans' health and well - being via basic , translational , clinical , health services , and rehabilitative research and to apply scientific knowledge to develop effective individualized care solutions for veterans. .

ord consists of four main research services , each headed by a director: biomedical laboratory r&d conducts preclinical research to understand life processes at the molecular , genomic , and physiological levels .

clinical science r&d supports clinical trials and other human subjects research to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of new treatments such as drugs , therapies , or devices ; compare existing therapies ; and improve clinical care and practice .

health services r&d conducts studies to identify and promote effective and efficient strategies to improve the quality and accessibility of the va health system and patient outcomes , and to minimize health care costs .

rehabilitation r&d conducts research and develops novel approaches to improving the quality of life of impaired and disabled veterans .

in addition to intramural support , va researchers are eligible to obtain funding for their research from extramural sources , including other federal agencies , private foundations and health organizations , and commercial entities .

according to the president's fy2021 budget request , these additional r&d resources are estimated at $540 million in fy2021 .

however , unlike other federal agencies , such as the national institutes of health and the department of defense , va does not have the authority to support extramural r&d by providing research grants to colleges , universities , or other non - va entities .

table 15 summarizes r&d program funding for va in the medical and prosthetic research and the medical care support accounts .

table 16 details amounts to be spent in designated research areas ( dras ) , which va describes as "areas of importance to our veteran patient population. .

funding for research projects that span multiple areas may be included in several dras ; thus , the amounts in table 16 total to more than the appropriation or request for va r&d .

the department of transportation was established by the department of transportation act ( p.l .

89-670 ) on october 15 , 1966 .

the primary purposes of dot research and development activities as defined by section 6019 of the fixing america's surface transportation act ( p.l .

11 4-94 ) are improving mobility of people and goods ; reducing congestion ; promoting safety ; improving the durability and extending the life of transportation infrastructure ; preserving the environment ; and preserving the existing transportation system .

funding for dot r&d is generally included in appropriations line items that also include non - r&d activities .

the amount of funding provided by appropriations legislation that is allocated to r&d is unclear unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after dot agencies allocate their final appropriations to specific activities and report those figures .

in fy2021 , the administration is requesting a total of $593.8 million for dot r&d activities and facilities at the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) , the federal railroad administration ( fra ) , the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration ( phmsa ) , and the office of the secretary ( ost ) ( see table 17 ) .

the administration is not requesting funding for dot r&d activities and facilities associated with the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) , the federal transit administration ( fta ) , or the federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) , citing the need for surface transportation reauthorization legislation .

in fy2020 , three dot agenciesâfaa , nhtsa , and fhwaâaccounted for nearly 90% of dot r&d funding .

the department of the interior ( doi ) was created to conserve and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage , to provide scientific and other information about those resources , and to uphold "the nation's trust responsibilities or special commitments to american indians , alaska natives , and affiliated island communities to help them prosper. .

doi has a wide range of responsibilities , including , among other things , mapping , geological , hydrological , and biological science ; migratory bird , wildlife , and endangered species conservation ; surface - mined lands protection and restoration ; and historic preservation .

the administration is requesting $12.8 billion in net discretionary funding for doi in fy2021 .

of that amount , $725 million is proposed for r&d , $248 million ( 25% ) below the fy2020 estimated level of $973 million .

the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) is the only doi component that conducts basic research .

funding for doi r&d is generally included in appropriations line items that also include non - r&d activities .

how much of the funding provided in appropriations legislation is allocated to r&d specifically is unclear unless funding is provided at the precise level of the request .

in general , r&d funding levels are known only after doi components allocate their appropriations to specific activities and report those figures .

the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has identified five core missions: to prevent terrorism and enhance security , to secure and manage the borders , to enforce and administer immigration laws , to safeguard and secure cyberspace , and to ensure resilience to disasters .

new technology resulting from research and development can contribute to achieving all these goals .

the directorate of science and technology ( s&t ) has primary responsibility for establishing , administering , and coordinating dhs r&d activities .

other components , such as the countering weapons of mass destruction office , the u.s. coast guard , and the transportation security administration , conduct r&d relating to their specific missions .

the president's fy2021 budget request for dhs includes $439 million for activities identified as r&d .

this would be a reduction of 19.6% from $546 million in fy2020 .

the total includes $340â million for the r&d account in the s&t directorate and smaller amounts for four other dhs components .

see table 19 .

the s&t directorate performs r&d in several laboratories of its own and funds r&d performed by the doe national laboratories , industry , universities , and others .

it also conducts testing and other technology - related activities in support of acquisitions by other dhs components .

the administration's fy2021 request of $340 million for the s&t directorate r&d account would be a decrease of 19.5% from $422 million in fy2020 .

five of the six thrust areas in the s&t directorate's research , development , and innovation budget line would decrease , by amounts ranging from 18.3% ( cyber security / information analysis ) to 32.4% ( chemical , biological , and explosives defense ) , while funding for the sixth thrust area , innovative research and foundational tools , would increase by 35.2% .

funding for university centers of excellence would decrease from $37 million in fy2020 to $18 million in fy2021 ( congress rejected a similar proposal in the fy2020 budget ) .

in addition to its r&d account , the s&t directorate receives funding for laboratory facilities and other r&d - related expenses through two other accounts ( not shown in the table ) .

the total request for the directorate is $644 million , a decrease of 12.7% from $737 million in fy2020 .

the directorate's procurement , construction , and improvements account would receive $19 million in the administration's request ( versus zero in fy2020 ) for closure of the plum island animal disease centerâwhich is being replaced by the national bio and agro - defense facility ( nbaf ) âand for preparation of plum island itself for sale .

the request for r&d in the countering weapons of mass destruction office is $58 million , down from $69 million in fy2019 .

no funding is requested for the national technical nuclear forensics program ( $7 million in fy2020 ) , which the administration is proposing to transfer to the doe national nuclear security administration .

the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) , the federal regulatory agency responsible for administering a number of environmental pollution control laws , funds a broad range of r&d activities to provide scientific tools and knowledge that support decisions relating to preventing , regulating , and abating environmental pollution .

since fy2006 , congress has funded epa through the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations acts .

appropriations for epa r&d are generally included in line - items that also include non - r&d activities .

annual appropriations bills and the accompanying committee reports do not identify precisely how much funding provided in appropriations bills is allocated to epa r&d alone .

epa determines its r&d funding levels in operation through allocating its appropriations to specific activities and reporting those amounts .

the agency's science and technology ( s&t ) appropriations account funds much of epa's scientific research activities , which include r&d conducted by the agency at its own laboratories and facilities , and r&d and related scientific research conducted by universities , foundations , and other nonfederal entities that receive epa grants .

the s&t account receives a base appropriation and a transfer from the hazardous substance superfund ( superfund ) account for research on more effective methods for remediating contaminated sites .

epa's office of research and development ( ord ) is the primary manager of r&d at epa headquarters and laboratories around the country , as well as external r&d .

a large portion of the s&t account funds epa r&d activities managed by ord , including research grants .

programs implemented by other offices within epa also may have a research component , but the research component is not necessarily the primary focus of the program .

as with the president's fy2020 budget request , the fy2021 request proposes reductions and eliminations of funding for fy2021 across a number of epa programs and activities .

the president's fy2021 request includes a total of $6.66 billion for epa ( after rescissions ) , $2.40 billion ( 26.5% ) less than the total $9.06 billion fy2020 enacted appropriations ( no rescissions ) for epa provided in title ii of the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116- 94 ) , and $435.6 million ( 7.0% ) more than the fy2020 request of $6.22 billion for epa ( after rescissions ) .

reductions proposed in the president's fy2021 request are distributed across epa operational functions and activities as well as grants for states , tribes , and local governments .

with the exception of the building and facilities account , the president's fy2021 request proposes funding reductions below fy2020 enacted levels for the nine other epa appropriations accounts , although funding for some program areas within the accounts would remain constant or increase .

some members of congress expressed concerns regarding proposed reductions of funding for epa scientific research programs during hearings on the president's fy2021 budget request .

similar proposed reductions in the fy2020 budget request were generally not included in the fy2020 enacted appropriations .

including a $19.1 million transfer from the superfund account , the president's fy2021 budget request proposes $503.8 million for epa's s&t account , $243.4 million ( 32.6% ) less than the fy2020 enacted $747.2 million for the s&t account provided in p.l .

116-94 , which included a $30.7 million transfer from the superfund .

the fy2021 request would provide an increase of 4.8% for the s&t account compared to the fy2020 request of $480.8 million , which included a $17.8 million transfer from the superfund account .

table 20 at the end of this section includes the president's fy2021 request for program areas and activities within epa's s&t account as presented in epa's fy2021 congressional budget justification compared to the fy2020 enacted appropriations as reported in the explanatory statement accompanying p.l .

116-94 that includes the department of interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations .

house and senate appropriations committee reports and explanatory statements accompanying recent fiscal year epa proposed and enacted appropriations have not specified funding for all subprogram areas reported in epa's budget justifications .

s&t subprogram areas not directly reported in house and senate appropriations committee reports are noted in table 20 as "nr" ( not reported ) .

additionally , the president's fy2018 through fy2021 budget requests and epa's associated congressional budget justifications have modified the titles for some of the program areas relative to previous administrations' budget requests and congressional committee reports' presentations .

the house and senate appropriations committees have generally adopted the modified program area titles as presented in the recent budget requests .

as shown in table 20 , with few exceptions the requested fy2021 amount for individual epa program area and activity line items within the s&t account would be less than the fy2020 enacted appropriations .

the fy2021 request did not propose to completely eliminate funding for the broader program areas ; however , eliminations ( no funding is requested for fy2021 ) are proposed for line - item activities below the program areas as indicated in table 20 .

these program areas include atmospheric protection program ( formerly ghg [greenhouse gas] reporting program and climate protection program ) , indoor air radon program , and reduce risks from indoor air .

for other program areas , proposed reductions in funding included eliminations of certain activities within those program areas .

for example , the proposed reduction in funding for research: air and energy , research: safe and sustainable water resources , research: sustainable and healthy communities , and research: chemical safety and sustainability program areas for fy2021 included the proposed elimination of funding for the science to achieve results ( star ) program .

the fy2020 enacted appropriations for the s&t account included $6.0 million for research: national priorities within the s&t account for fy2020 , an increase compared to $5.0 million included for fy2019 .

as in the previous administration's fiscal year requests , the president's fy2021 budget request did not include funding for research: national priorities .

the size and structure of the epa's workforce has been a topic of debate during congressional committee hearings , particularly in recent fiscal years .

"workforce reshaping" was introduced in the fy2018 request and described as agency - wide organizational restructuring , "reprioritization of agency activities," and reallocation of resources .

workforce reshaping was most recently proposed in the fy2020 request .

as with the fy2018 and fy2019 enacted appropriations , p.l .

116-94 did not fund the president's fy2020 request for epa workforce reshaping for fy2020 .

the fy2021 request does not include similar funding for epa workforce reshaping ; however , according to the epa's fy2021 congressional budget justification , the number of full - time - equivalents ( ftes ) would be reduced from 14,172.0 ftes in fy2020 to 12,610.2 ftes in fy2021 .
