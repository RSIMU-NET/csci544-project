in april 2003 , the department of defense ( dod ) sent a proposal entitled "the defensetransformation for the 21st century act" to congress .

 ( 1 ) changes in the uniformed military personnel and acquisitionsystems were the principal focus of the proposal .

however , it also recommended changes to thestatutory bases for much of dod's civilian personnel system , which covers some 700,000 civilianemployees ( about 26% of federal civilian executive branch personnel worldwide ) .

on june 4 , 2003 , the senate struckall after the enacting clause and substituted the text of s. 1050 in h.r .

1588 .

thesenate then passed h.r .

1588 , amended , by voice vote the same day .

 ( 6 ) h.r .

1588 , aspassed by the senate , included , at title xi , personnel provisions on pay authority for criticalpositions , the experimental personnel program for scientific and technical personnel , and personnelinvestigations that were not included in the house - passed version of the bill or s. 1166 .

senator susan collins , chairman of the senate committee on governmental affairs,introduced s. 1166 , the national security personnel system act , on june 2 , 2003 , andit was referred to the senate governmental affairs committee .

on june 4 , 2003 , the committeeconducted a hearing on the bill .

following the hearing , senators voinovich and thomas carperasked the comptroller general , david walker , to respond to several additional questions .

hisresponse , submitted on july 3 , 2003 , included the following comments .

[i]t is critical that agencies or components have in placethe human capital infrastructure and safeguards before implementing new human capital reforms.this institutional infrastructure includes , at a minimum ( 1 ) a human capital planning process thatintegrates the agency's human capital policies , strategies , and programs with its program mission,goals , and desired outcomes , ( 2 ) the capabilities to develop and implement a new human capitalsystem effectively , and ( 3 ) a modern , effective , credible and , as appropriate , validated performanceappraisal and management system that includes adequate safeguards , such as reasonable transparencyand appropriate accountability mechanisms , to ensure the fair , effective , and nondiscriminatoryimplementation of the system .

although we do not believe that dod should wait forthe full implementation of the new human capital system at the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , ... we do think that there are important lessons that can be learned from how dhs isdeveloping its new personnel system .

for example , dhs has implemented an approach that includesa design team of employees from dhs , the office of personnel management ( opm ) , and majorlabor unions .

to further involve employees , dhs has conducted a series of town hall meetingsaround the country and held focus groups to further learn of employees' views and comments ...dod ... needs to ensure that employees are involved in order to obtain their ideas and gain adequate"buy - in" for any related transformational efforts .

[w]e suggest that dod also be required to link itsperformance management system to program and performance goals and desired outcomes.... [this]helps the organization ensure that its efforts are properly aligned and reinforces the line of sightbetween individual performance and organizational success so that an individual can see how her / hisdaily responsibilities contribute to results and outcomes .

in our view , it would be preferable to employ agovernmentwide approach to address certain flexibilities that have broad - based application andserious potential implications for the civil service system .... broad banding , pay for performance,reemployment , and pension offset waivers .

in these situations , it may be prudent and preferable forcongress to provide such authorities on a governmentwide basis and in a manner that assures thata sufficient personnel infrastructure and appropriate safeguards are in place before an agencyimplements the new authorities .

based on our experience , while dod's leadership hasthe intent and the ability to transform the department , the needed institutional infrastructure is notin place in a vast majority of dod organizations... .

in the absence of the right institutionalinfrastructure , granting additional human capital authorities will provide little advantage and couldactually end up doing damage if the authorities are not implemented properly by the respectivedepartment or agency .

 ( 7 ) the senate governmental affairs committee marked up the bill on june 17 , 2003 , and , onthe same day , ordered s. 1166 to be reported to the senate , amended , on a 10 to 1 rollcall vote .

during the mark - up , the committee agreed to an amendment offered by senator josephlieberman to clarify the intent of the bill's provisions on collective bargaining and an amendmentoffered by senator george voinovich to exclude 10 dod laboratories from the nsps .

bothamendments were agreed to by voice vote .

on september 5 , 2003 , the committee reported s.1166 to the senate with amendments and without a written report .

senator collins , a conferee on the conference committee for h.r .

1588 , alongwith senators voinovich and carl levin ( an h.r .

1588 conferee ) , among others , expressedthe hope that the provisions of s. 1166 , as amended , would be seriously considered bythe conference as an alternative to the provisions in h.r .

1588 on the nsps .

on july 14,2003 , senators collins , voinovich , stevens , and sununu wrote a letter to their senate colleaguesexpressing their support for , and sharing their views on , the personnel provisions of s.1166 .

they stated that , "[a]s a template for future governmentwide civilian personnelreform , the personnel provisions in the defense bill must strike the right balance between promotinga flexible system and protecting the rights of our constituents who serve in the federal civil service"and that "[w]e believe that our proposal strikes such a balance. .

 ( 8 ) several provisions that werethe same or similar to s. 1166 were added to h.r .

1588 in conference .

on november 7 , 2003 , the house agreed to the conference report ( h.rept .

the timetable for implementing the nsps has changed several times .

discussions onimplementation began in january 2004 .

 ( 10 ) initially , dod planned to publish details of the new system byapril 2004 , and cover 300,000 civilian dod employees under the nsps by october 1 , 2004 .

inearly february 2004 , secretary of defense donald rumsfeld named then - navy secretary andnow - deputy secretary of defense gordon england as the dod official responsible for negotiatingwith labor organizations on the personnel reform effort .

 ( 11 ) on april 14 , 2004 , secretary england announced thatimplementation of the nsps would be phased in over several years so that all employees would becovered by the nsps by october 1 , 2006 .

more specific implementation steps and a revised timetable were announced by secretaryengland on december 15 , 2004 , as follows .

 ( 12 ) civilian dod employees being converted to the nsps were tobe grouped into three "spirals. .

upwards of 300,000 general schedule employees from the army,navy , marine corps , air force , office of the secretary of defense , and other dod offices who arebased in the united states were to comprise spiral one .

spiral two was to consist of all remainingeligible employees and spiral three was to cover employees of the dod laboratories if currentlegislative restrictions covering laboratory employees had been eliminated .

the new system was tobe implemented in phases .

spiral one was scheduled to be implemented in three phases over 18months beginning around july 2005 and covering some 60,000 employees .

spiral two wasscheduled to begin after the department had assessed spiral one and after the secretary of defensecertified dod's performance management system .

full implementation of the new system wasanticipated anywhere from july 2007 through january 2008 .

implementation of the labor relationscomponent of the new system was anticipated by summer 2005 .

on october 26 , 2005 , dod announced a further revised implementation schedule for thensps .

key implementation steps were to occur as follows: in early fy2006 , the labor relations system was to be implemented acrossdod for employees who are currently covered by 5 u.s.c .

chapter 71 , and training in performancemanagement was to begin for employees , managers and supervisors , and human resourcespractitioners .

in early calendar year 2006 , spiral 1.1 was to be implemented and cover some65,000 employees .

in spring 2006 , spiral 1.2 was to be implemented and cover some 48,000employees .

in fall 2006 , spiral 1.3 was to be implemented and cover some 160,000employees and the performance cycle was to end for employees in spirals 1.1 and1.2 .

in early calendar year 2007 , employees in spirals 1.1 and 1.2 were to receivetheir first pay - for - performance payout .

in early calendar year 2008 , employees in spiral 1.3 were to receive their firstpay - for - performance payout .

 ( 13 ) another revision to the nsps implementation schedule was announced by dod on january17 , 2006 , and updated on february 13 , 2006 , and march 3 , 2006 .

beginning in late april 2006 , theclassification , performance management , compensation , staffing , and workforce shaping provisionsof the new system will be implemented .

under the revised schedule , the following was established: spiral 1.1 will include the first employees to be covered by the nsps , some11,000 workers in department - wide , army , navy , and air force activities .

 ( 14 ) the performance ratingcycle for these employees will extend through october 2006 , and the first performance payout willoccur in january 2007 .

spiral 1.2 will begin in october 2006 , and spiral 1.3 will begin in january2007 .

performance payouts will occur in january 2008 .

the dod agencies that will participate inthese spirals are still to be determined .

spirals 2 and 3 will be formed and commence following certification of theperformance management system .

 ( 15 ) proposed regulations to implement the system were jointly published in the federal register by dod and opm on february 14 , 2005 .

 ( 16 ) dod and opm conducted a joint briefing on the proposedregulations on february 10 , 2005 .

 ( 17 ) according to the defense department , more than 58,000comments were submitted on the proposed regulations .

dod and opm jointly published the finalregulations in the federal register on november 1 , 2005 .

 ( 18 ) the regulations generallyexpress concepts for the new system rather than details about how it will operate .

the regulationsstate that "issuances" to implement the regulations will be prepared by dod .

on november 23,2005 , dod released the drafts of the "issuances" and , as of the date of the report , are still underreview by the department and labor organizations .

revised drafts of the "issuances" on performancemanagement and pay pools were released on february 28 , 2006 , and , likewise , are subject tocontinuing collaboration between dod and the unions .

the process for designing the new personnel system involved program executive officeworking groups , which began a nearly two - month process to develop and evaluate options for thensps in late july 2004 .

focus groups and town hall meetings and discussions with union leaderswere employed by the working groups to gather input from employees and stakeholders .

 ( 19 ) other specificimplementation steps are noted below under relevant sections of the law .

dod has established awebsite to monitor implementation of the nsps .

 ( 20 ) prior to the enactment of the provisions authorizing the department of defense to create anew human resources management system , dod civilians were covered by the personnel lawscodified in title 5 united states code on government organization and employees .

under theauthority granted by title xi of p.l .

108-136 , some 700,000 civilian employees are expected to becovered by the new national security personnel system .

the nsps policies ( especially in the areasof pay , performance management , adverse actions and appeals , and labor management relations ) aremore flexible than those under title 5 .

during debate prior to the enactment of p.l .

108-136 andin discussions that have continued since , several members of congress stated that implementationof the nsps ( along with the department of homeland security's new hrm system currently beingcreated ) should be monitored as a possible model for amending title 5 and extending thoseprovisions to the rest of the federal government's civilian workforce .

reflecting the importance of carefully crafting the nsps , senators susan collins , carl levin,ted stevens , john sununu , and george voinovich reportedly sent a letter to secretary england onmarch 3 , 2004 , which stated that [t]he involvement of the civilian work force in thedesign of the new national security personnel system is critical to its ultimate acceptance andsuccessful implementation .

full collaboration with the office of personnel management and thefederal employee unions will assist the department in meeting this critical challenge .

 ( 21 ) a march 12 , 2004 , letter sent by senator daniel akaka to secretary of defense donaldrumsfeld urged dod to issue all proposals on the nsps in the federal register and not as internalregulations , for reasons of "openness , transparency , public comment , and scrutiny of thedetails. .

 ( 22 ) senatoredward kennedy , in a december 10 , 2004 , press release , also emphasized development of the newsystem "in the most transparent way possible. .

according to the senator: congress gave the department of defense the authorityto make major personnel changes affecting 700,000 defense employees , but only with theunderstanding that those changes would be made in consultation with representatives of theemployees .

it's appalling that the bush administration is ignoring that understanding bystonewalling the representatives and refusing to let them review personnel changes before they arepublished.... ( 23 ) government executive reported that senator kennedy wrote to defense secretary donaldrumsfeld and opm director kay coles james on november 19 , 2004 , to voice opposition to theirrefusal to share the details of the new personnel system with officials of the unions representingdod employees in advance of the publication of the regulations in the federal register .

reportedly , dod believes that do to so would "depart from the intent of the administrativeprocedures act. .

 ( 24 ) in a press release issued on february 10 , 2005 , senator lieberman expressed his deepdisappointment with the personnel rules , stating: "the proposal imposes excessive limits oncollective bargaining ... changes the appeals process to interfere with employees' rights to dueprocess ... and ... contains unduly vague and untested pay and performance provisions. .

 ( 25 ) .

p.l .

108-136 provides the following .

 ( 26 ) section 1101 ( a ) ( 1 ) of p.l .

108-136 amends part iii , subpart i,of title 5 united states code by adding a new chapter 99 entitled department of defense ( dod ) national security personnel system .

the new system covers some 700,000 dod civilianemployees .

the provisions at subtitle c of title xi of p.l .

108-136 apply to federal civilian employeesgovernment - wide .
