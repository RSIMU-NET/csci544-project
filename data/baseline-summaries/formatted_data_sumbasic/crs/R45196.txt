the present structure of congressional oversight of the intelligence community ( ic ) largely resulted from investigations by two congressional committees in the 1970sâin the senate , chaired by idaho senator frank church , and in the house , chaired by representative otis pikeâthat suggested a need for permanent committees in each chamber: today's senate select committee on intelligence ( ssci ) and the house permanent select committee on intelligence ( hpsci ) .

it is important to note , however , that oversight of intelligence is a function of more than just the two congressional intelligence committees .

ten other committeesâthe armed services , foreign affairs / foreign relations , homeland security , judiciary , and appropriations committees of both chambersâexercise oversight responsibility to varying degrees over intelligence programs or ic elements that fall under their jurisdiction .

the church and pike committees' oversight focused primarily on two themes: investigation of past abuses and ic organizational reform .

over the succeeding years those efforts have been both beneficial and occasionally burdensome .

in protecting against the ic's abuse of its authorities , congress has helped ensure intelligence activities were legal , ethical and consistent with american values .

congress's influence in ic organizational reform has resulted in improved performance and accountability .

on other occasions , however , congressional oversight has tended toward micromanagement resulting in strains in the relationship with the ic .

this report posits a potential framework for congressional oversight of intelligence - related programs and activities using the existing committee structure and notification standards for the most sensitive intelligence activities: covert action and clandestine intelligence collection .

the framework may assist congress in assessing the premises justifying each of these activities , their impact on national security , operational viability , funding requirements , and possible long - term or unintended consequences .

unlike areas with a broad public following , such as health care , veterans' services , and agriculture , intelligence programs and activities are generally classified , receive little public exposure , and have no natural public constituency .

highly classified covert action and clandestine intelligence programs do not often have visibility outside of congress .

congressional oversight , therefore , provides one of the few meaningful checks on the president's execution of intelligence policy and programs that may have significant bearing on u.s. foreign relations and national security .

among the recommendations of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( the "9 / 11 commission" ) were those aimed at strengthening intelligence oversight .

since the church and pike committees of the 1970s , congress occasionally has been able to refine its oversight of the ic .

however , it has not been able to sustain its early momentum .

as the final report of the 9 / 11 commission put it , "...the oversight function of the congressâ¦diminished over time .

in recent years , traditional review of the administration of programs and implementation of laws has been replaced by 'a focus on personal investigations , possible scandals , and issues designed to generate media attention. .

the unglamorous but essential work of oversight has been neglected , and few members past or present believe it is performed well....[t]he executive branch needed help from congress in addressing the questions of counterterrorism strategy and policy , looking past day - to - day concerns....congress...often missed the big questionsâas did the executive branch. .

since 9 / 11 , the senate especially has made progress toward following through with organizational reform of the oversight process , following through on several of the 9 / 11 commission's recommendations .

s.res .

445 ( 108 th congress ) amended senate rules governing intelligence oversight ( s.res .

400 ) aimed at increasing the authority of the ssci relative to the standing committees , promoting bipartisanship , and building expertise .

however , a number of factors have complicated congress's efforts to improve oversight .

this poses risks to national security when involving the most sensitive aspects of intelligenceâcovert action and clandestine activitiesâdue to their potential impact on u.s. foreign relations .

moreover , greater integration of military operations and intelligence activities has resulted in some confusion over the proper congressional jurisdiction for exercising oversight on capitol hill .

congress has expressed concern that the department of defense's ( dod ) overuse of terms that are not defined in statute , such as operational preparation of the environment ( ope ) , to describe operations that may resemble intelligence activities allows dod to circumvent the more stringent oversight requirements of the congressional intelligence committees .

despite these challenges , congressional oversight remains an important check on policy and decisions of the executive branch , to insure intelligence programs and activities are ethical , legal and properly aligned with u.s. national security and foreign policy objectives .

congressional oversight of covert action can be organized around a framework of five issue areas: ( 1 ) the activity's statutory parameters , ( 2 ) u.s. national security interests , ( 3 ) u.s. foreign policy objectives , ( 4 ) funding and implementation , and ( 5 ) risk assessment .

these categories enable congress to analyze and assess the specific elements of each activity from a strategic point of view .

by extension , congressional oversight of anticipated clandestine intelligence activities that might also shape the political , economic or military environment abroad can apply the same framework and , as with oversight of covert action , address the risk of compromise , unintended consequences , and loss of life .

a conceptual framework for congressional oversight of covert action begins with its statutory definition: covert action is codified as "an activity or activities of the united states government to influence political , economic , or military conditions abroad , where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly. .

there are a number of exceptions in the statutory definition of covert action ; these include some activities that could use clandestine methodology .

exceptions include activities primarily intended to collect intelligence ; traditional counterintelligence activities ; traditional military activities , or support to traditional military activities ; traditional law enforcement activities , or routine support to law enforcement ; and traditional diplomatic activities .

how these exceptions are defined and applied to actual practice is not always straightforward and can complicate congressional oversight .

for example , congress has expressed concern that dod too frequently applies the term traditional military activities to describe operations that in many respects resemble covert action .

this is important insofar as it results in different committees being informed of the activity and different standards for the timeliness of notification .

oversight also requires a solid grasp of the u.s. national security interests and foreign policy objectives that each administration details its national security strategy , national defense strategy , and other strategy and policy documents .

covert action statutorily must support "identifiable foreign policy interests of the united states. .

although not required by statute , it would be logical for clandestine intelligence ( and military ) activities that do not constitute covert action but have in common a high risk of compromise of sources and methods , a high impact on u.s. foreign relations , and a potential for the loss of life also to support identifiable ( clearly articulated , documented ) foreign policy objectives expressly .

moreover , congressional overseers may wish to identify or have expressly identified for them , the executive branch's assumptions about the international environment since these assumptions influence policy that in turn , influences decisions on covert action and clandestine activities .

although congress has no statutory prerogative to veto covert action when informed through a presidential finding , it can influence conduct of an operation through the exercise of congressional constitutional authority and responsibilities to authorize war , legislate , appropriate funds , and otherwise interact with the executive branch .

as former cia inspector general l. britt snider wrote , if the committees do not support a particular operation or have concerns about aspects of it , an administration would have to think twice about proceeding with it as planned .

if it is disclosed or ends in disaster , the administration will want to have had congress on board .

if it is going to last more than a year , the committees' support will be needed for continued funding .

the committees are also likely to be better indicators of how the public would react if the program were disclosed than the administration's in - house pundits .

as congressional oversight committees assess each impending covert action from a strategic point of view , congress may wish to organize its review using the following five issue areas: 1. the activity's statutory parameters ; 2 .

u.s. national security interests ; 3 .

u.s. foreign policy objectives ; 4. funding and implementation ; and 5. risk of compromise , failure , loss of life , and unintended consequences .

by extension , oversight of anticipated clandestine intelligence activities that might also shape the political , economic , or military environment abroad can apply the same framework , and , like oversight of covert action , address the risk of compromise , unintended consequences , and loss of life .

statute requires the president update congress with notifications of changes in conditions from those described in the original notification of a covert action .

congressional oversight consequently extends to periodically reviewing changes in the operational environment on the ground that may suggest a different outcome , a change in strategy , a shift in u.s. interests , or the development of unintended consequences .

along these lines , â§3093 ( d ) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of title 50 u. s. code includes the following provision: the president shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees , or , if applicable , [the gang of eight] , are notified in writing of any significant change in a previously approved covert action , or any significant undertaking pursuant to a previously approved finding , in the same manner as findings are reported pursuant to subsection ( c ) .

in determining whether an activity constitutes a significant undertaking for these purposes , the president shall consider whether the activity - involves significant risk of loss of life ; requires an expansion of existing authorities , including authorities relating to research , development , or operations ; results in the expenditure of significant funds or other resources ; requires notification ; gives rise to a significant risk of disclosing intelligence sources or methods ; or presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of serious damage to the diplomatic relations of the united states if such activity were disclosed without authorization .

former cia inspector general l. britt snider has suggested that congress , in carrying out its oversight responsibility , might be vulnerable to failure to review the premises and conditions for the covert action that may have changed , perhaps significantly , subsequent to the initial notification .

the risk , as articulated by snider is that "if members are satisfied with what they hear from administration witnesses [during the initial notification] , not only will they acquiesce in the implementation of the operation , they are apt to devote less attention to it down the road. .

to guard against this outcome , this provision of the covert action statute underscores the importance of being alert to the possible tactical , political , and environment changes that warrant continued oversight to ensure the activity continues to be in the u.s. national interest .

do the original premises or environmental conditions justifying the activity remain valid ? .

have there been any outcomes to suggest the intelligence activity is achieving its intended result ? .

does the activity continue to have the funding necessary to be effective ? .

have there been any changes in conditions on the ground that might influence a significant change in how the activity is executed ? .

is there an increase in the risk of premature or unauthorized disclosure ? .

do american citizens face a greater threat of exposure ? .

does the risk involved remain acceptable ? .

does the activity still conform to the statutory guidelines on the conduct of covert action or significant clandestine intelligence activities ? .
