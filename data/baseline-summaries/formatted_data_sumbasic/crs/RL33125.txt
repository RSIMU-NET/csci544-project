since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , policymakers have linked the issue of immigration , particularly unauthorized immigration , to homeland security .

this linkage was cemented with the passage of the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l .

107-296 ) , which shifted primary responsibility for immigration policy from the former immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) to a new department of homeland security ( dhs ) .

as in the past several years , security concerns have figured prominently in the development of and debate on immigration legislation in the 109 th congress .

in may 2005 , the real id act became law as division b of the fy2005 emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense , the global war on terror , and tsunami relief ( p.l .

109-13 ) .

it contains a number of immigration and identification document - related provisions intended to improve homeland security .

the security - related issue of immigration enforcement continues to be on the congressional agenda .

various bills have been introduced that address enforcement - related issues , including border security ; the roles of the u.s. military , civilian patrols , and state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement ; smuggling ; detention ; and the enforcement of prohibitions on employing unauthorized workers .

among these bills are the border protection , antiterrorism , and illegal immigration control act of 2005 ( h.r .

4437 ) , which was passed by the house on december 16 , 2005 , and the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 ( s. 2611 ) , which was passed by the senate on may 25 , 2006 .

fencing provisions similar to those in h.r .

4437 have been enacted in p.l .

109-367 .

the fy2007 department of homeland security appropriations act ( p.l .

109-295 ) contains several security - related provisions , including border tunnel provisions like those in s. 2611 .

in addition , the house has passed a number of other enforcement - related measures , among them h.r .

6094 , h.r .

6095 , h.r .

6160 , and h.r .

6162 .

in addition to its enforcement provisions , s. 2611 contains provisions on temporary and permanent immigration , unauthorized aliens in the united states , and other issues .

in march 2006 , the senate judiciary committee amended and approved an s. 2611 predecessor proposal drafted by committee chairman specter , known as the chairman's mark .

this bill contained provisions on border enforcement , interior enforcement , and unlawful employment of aliens , as well as on guest workers , legal permanent immigration reform , unauthorized aliens in the united states , and other issues .

prior to the completion of the mark - up , senator frist introduced a separate bill , securing america's borders act ( s. 2454 ) , containing selected titles of the chairman's mark , with some modifications .

these titles address border enforcement , interior enforcement , unlawful employment , permanent legal immigration reform , and other topics .

s. 2454 does not contain provisions on guest workers or on the future status of unauthorized aliens in the united states .

during senate floor debate on s. 2454 in late march , senator specter proposed a substitute amendment based on the judiciary committee - approved bill ( s.amdt .

3192 ) .

on april 6 , 2006 , the senate rejected a motion , by a vote of 39 to 60 , to invoke cloture ( and thereby initiate post - cloture procedures to eventually move to a vote ) on the specter substitute .

the following day , the senate rejected two other cloture motions: it rejected , on a 38 to 60 vote , a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to recommit s. 2454 to the senate judiciary committee with instructions that it be reported back with the hagel amendment ( hagel - martinez compromise ) ; and it rejected , on a 36 to 62 vote , a motion to invoke cloture on s. 2454 .

the hagel - martinez compromise , with some modifications , was subsequently introduced in the senate as the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 ( s. 2611 / s. 2612 ) .

while major immigration reform proposals remain pending , congress has enacted limited provisions on temporary and permanent employment - based immigration as part of p.l .

109-13 and p.l .

109-364 .

it also has enacted legislation concerning alien victims of domestic violence , trafficking in persons , and refugees .

this report discusses these and other immigration - related issues that have seen legislative action or are of significant congressional interest .

dhs appropriations and immigration legislation related to hurricane katrina are addressed in other products and are not covered here .

the final section of the report lists enacted legislation and selected bills receiving action .

during the 108 th congress , a number of proposals concerning immigration and identification - document security were introduced , some of which were enacted as part of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-458 ) .

at the time that law was adopted , some congressional leaders reportedly agreed to revisit certain immigration and document - security issues in the 109 th congress that had been dropped from the final version of the legislation .

the real id act ( p.l .

109-13 , division b ) contains a number of the dropped provisions , along with some new proposals .

this discussion focuses on titles i , ii , and iii of the real id act .

titles iv and v , which deal with nonimmigrant and immigrant workers , are covered respectively in the temporary and permanent immigration sections of this report .

dhs is charged with protecting our nation's borders from weapons of mass destruction , terrorists , smugglers , and unauthorized aliens .

border security involves securing the many means by which people and things can enter the country .

operationally , this means controlling the official ports of entry ( poe ) through which legitimate travelers and commerce enter the country , and patrolling the nation's land and maritime borders to safeguard against and interdict illegal entries .

border security has been a key immigration issue for the 109 th congress .

enactment of border security provisions as part of the real id act , as discussed above , has been followed by congressional consideration of a variety of other related measures .

there has been much debate in the 109 th congress about whether dhs has sufficient resources to fulfill its border security mission , and some bills would add resources to the border , including personnel , infrastructure , and technology or institute new programs within the department .

other bills propose to expand various programs already being implemented by dhs at the border .

h.r .

4437 , as passed by the house , and s. 2611 , as passed by the senate , contain provisions of both types .

some border security provisions in h.r .

4437 and s. 2611 have been enacted in the fy2007 dhs appropriations act ( p.l .

109-295 ) and in the secure fence act of 2006 ( p.l .

109-367 ) .

other border security - related measures , including h.r .

4830 , h.r .

6160 , and h.r .

6162 , also have been passed by the house .

p.l .

109-295 makes the construction and financing of tunnels crossing the u.s. international border crimes subject to a fine and up to 20 years of imprisonment , and doubles the applicable criminal penalties for individuals who use tunnels to enter the country illegally or to smuggle people or goods into the country .

these tunnel provisions also appear in s. 2611 , as passed by the senate , and h.r .

4830 , as passed by the house .

another border - security related provision in p.l .

109-295 requires the dhs inspector general to review all contracts relating to the department's secure border initiative ( sbi ) worth more than $20 million .

this provision was included in h.r .

4437 , s. 2611 , and house - passed h.r .

6162 .

p.l .

109-295 also includes $1.2 billion in funding for border fencing , infrastructure , and technology , but does not specify what mix of resources should be implemented or to what locations on the border these resources should be allocated , instead leaving these decisions to dhs's discretion .

p.l .

109-367 directs dhs to construct border fencing along five different stretches of the southern border that total roughly 850 miles .

this language is identical to that in h.r .

4437 , but includes later construction deadlines .

p.l .

109-367 also calls for a study on the feasibility of constructing border security infrastructure along the northern border .

s. 2611 , as amended , would direct dhs to replace current border fencing in the border patrol's tucson and yuma sectors and to construct additional border fencing totaling 370 miles and additional vehicle barriers totaling 700 miles .

h.r .

4437 , as passed by the house , and s. 2611 , as passed by the senate , contain a number of other border - security related provisions .

both bills would require the secretary of dhs to submit a national strategy for border security outlining a comprehensive strategy for securing the border , including a surveillance plan and a time line for implementation .

both would add personnel , technology , and infrastructure resources at and between poe and would direct dhs to work with the department of defense ( dod ) to formulate a plan for increasing the availability and use of military equipment to assist with the surveillance of the border .

both bills would require dhs to expand the u.s .

visitor and immigrant status technology ( us - visit ) program to collect 10 fingerprints from aliens currently required to register with the program as they enter the country , and would require dhs to submit a time line for deploying and enabling the exit component of us - visit at land poe .

both bills would also require dhs to enhance the connectivity of its biometric fingerprint database with the federal bureau of investigation's database and develop and implement a plan to ensure clear two - way communications for dhs agents working along the border .

while the border security provisions in s. 2611 and h.r .

4437 are largely similar , there are some substantive differences between the two bills .

among the major differences , house - passed h.r .

4437 would direct dhs to improve coordination and communication among its component agencies by creating task forces and other mechanisms to enhance information and intelligence sharing , and would require dhs to design and carry out a border security exercise involving officials from federal , state , local , tribal , and international governments as well as representatives from the private sector within one year of the bill's enactment .

it would allow homeland security grant funding to be used for reimbursing state and local governments for costs associated with detecting and responding to the unlawful entry of aliens .

h.r .

4437 would also remove air and marine operations ( amo ) from dhs's customs and border protection ( cbp ) and establish a stand - alone amo office within dhs .

for its part , s. 2611 includes three separate provisions that would direct dhs to acquire and deploy various kinds of surveillance assets in order to establish a "virtual fence" along the southwest border .

s. 2611 would also establish criminal penalties for attempting to evade inspection at poe or for disregarding orders given by cbp officers , border patrol agents , or immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) investigators .

h.r .

6160 , as passed by the house , would give recruitment and retention bonuses to border patrol agents .

since the attacks of september 11 , many have called on state and local law enforcement agencies to play a larger role in the enforcement of federal immigration laws .

some question , however , whether state and local law enforcement officers possess adequate authority to enforce all immigration laws — that is , both civil violations ( eg , lack of legal status , which may lead to removal through an administrative system ) and criminal punishments ( eg , alien smuggling , which is prosecuted in the courts ) .

historically , the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law has been construed to be limited to the criminal provisions of the ina ; by contrast , the enforcement of the civil provisions has been viewed strictly as a federal responsibility , with states playing an incidental supporting role .

some posit , nonetheless , that states and localities , as sovereign entities , retain certain police powers under the constitution , and consequently , possess inherent authority to enforce civil as well as criminal violations of federal immigration law .

multiple bills in congress would address these possible authority issues and enhance the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of immigration law .

h.r .

4437 ( §220 ) and h.r .

6095 ( §101 ) , both of which have been passed by the house , would "reaffirm" the existing inherent authority of states , as sovereign entities ( including their law enforcement personnel ) , to investigate , identify , apprehend , arrest , detain , or transfer into federal custody aliens in the united states for the purpose of assisting in the enforcement of the immigration laws .

similar to h.r .

4437 and h.r .

6095 , the department of homeland security authorization act for fy2006 ( h.r .

1817 ) , as passed by the house , would authorize state and local law enforcement personnel to apprehend , detain , or remove aliens in the united states in the course of carrying out routine duties ( §520 ) .

likewise , h.r .

1817 would "reaffirm" the existing general authority for state and local law enforcement personnel to carry out the above mentioned activities .

s. 2454 ( §229 ) and senate - passed s. 2611 ( §229 ) would also "reaffirm" a state's inherent authority to investigate , identify , apprehend , arrest , detain , or transfer into federal custody aliens in the united states , but would limit such practices to the enforcement of the criminal provisions of the ina .

among its other provisions , h.r .

4437 would require the secretary of dhs to create a training manual to aid state and local law enforcement officers in carrying out immigration - related enforcement duties ( §221 ) .

it would authorize the secretary to make grants to state and local police agencies for the procurement of equipment , technology , facilities , and other products that are directly related to the enforcement of immigration law ( §222 ) .

h.r .

4437 would allow a state to reimburse itself with certain dhs grants for activities related to the enforcement of federal laws aimed at preventing the unlawful entry of persons or things into the united states that are carried out under agreement with the federal government ( §305 ) .

the bill would further require designated sheriffs within 25 miles of the southern international border of the united states to be reimbursed or provided an advance for costs associated with the transfer of aliens detained or in the custody of the sheriff ( §607 ) .

in the senate , s. 2611 would create a border relief grant program for eligible law enforcement agencies to address criminal activity that occurs near the border ( §153 ) .

under the program , the secretary of dhs would be authorized to provide grants to law enforcement agencies located within 100 miles of the northern or southern border or to agencies outside 100 miles that are located in areas certified as "high impact areas" by the secretary .

two - thirds of the funds would be allocated to the six states with the largest number of unauthorized alien apprehensions , and one - third would be set aside for high impact areas .

title ix of the senate - passed version of h.r .

5441 , the fy2007 department of homeland security appropriations act , would have created the same program .

the house - passed version of h.r .

5441 did not contain such a grant program , and it is not included in the enacted measure ( p.l .

109-295 ) .

s. 2454 ( §§220 , 229 ) and s. 2611 ( §§224 , 229 ) would also authorize dhs to reimburse state and local authorities for certain training , transportation , and equipment costs related to immigration enforcement , and certain costs associated with processing criminal illegal aliens through the criminal justice system .

under the ina , it is unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire , recruit or refer for a fee , or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be so employed .

employers are required to participate in a paper - based employment eligibility verification system , commonly referred to as the i - 9 system , in which they examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility , and complete and retain i - 9 verification forms .

in addition , employers may elect to participate in an electronic employment eligibility verification system , established under a 1996 law .

participants in the basic pilot program electronically verify new hires' employment authorization through social security administration ( ssa ) and , if necessary , dhs databases .

employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil and / or criminal penalties .

enforcement of these provisions is termed worksite enforcement .

employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement are current areas of congressional interest .

chief among the reasons for this is the large and growing number of unauthorized aliens in the united states , the majority of whom are in the labor force .

according to estimates by the pew hispanic center , in 2005 , the unauthorized alien population totaled about 11.1 million and the unauthorized alien working population totaled about 7.2 million .

particularly since the 2001 terrorist attacks , many have raised security concerns about having such a large unauthorized population .

in addition , the issue of worksite enforcement has gained attention recently in connection with guest worker proposals .

president bush has expressed support for a new temporary worker program and has called for increased worksite enforcement as part of the program .

immigration reform bills containing guest worker and worksite enforcement - related provisions have been introduced in the 109 th congress .

a number of bills related to employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement are before the 109 th congress .

title vii of h.r .

4437 , as passed by the house , would direct dhs to establish an employment eligibility verification system ( modeled on the basic pilot program ) , which would be mandatory for all employers .

employers would be required to query the system to verify the identity and employment eligibility of an individual after hiring or , in a change from basic pilot program requirements , before commencing recruitment or referral .

these verification requirements would take effect two years after enactment .

the current i - 9 system would remain in place with some modifications .

h.r .

4437 also would require employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of previously hired workers by six years after enactment .

in addition , h.r .

4437 would increase existing monetary penalties for employer violations .

at the same time , it would provide for the reduction of civil monetary penalties for employers with 250 or fewer employees .

like h.r .

4437 , title iii of s. 2454 would direct dhs to establish an employment eligibility verification system ( modeled on the basic pilot program ) , which would be mandatory for all employers .

employers would be required to query the system to verify the identity and employment eligibility of an individual after hiring or recruiting or referring for a fee .

these verification requirements would be phased in for different groups of employers over a period of up to five years .

under s. 2454 , some , but not all , employers would be required to verify the identity and employment eligibility of previously hired workers .

employers subject to this requirement , which would be effective 180 days after enactment , would be those who are part of the critical infrastructure of the united states or who are directly related to u.s. national or homeland security .

s. 2454 also would increase existing monetary penalties for employer violations , although to a lesser extent than h.r .

4437 .

in addition , the senate bill would establish a new penalty for employees who falsely represent on the i - 9 form that they are authorized to work .

title iii of s. 2611 , as passed by the senate , like h.r .

4437 and s. 2454 , would direct dhs to implement an employment eligibility verification system ( modeled on the basic pilot program ) , which would be mandatory for all employers .

employers would be required to participate in the system with respect to all employees hired on or after the date that is 18 months after at least $400 million is appropriated and made available for implementation .

under s. 2611 , employers would be required to query the system to verify the identity and employment eligibility of an individual after hiring or recruiting or referring for a fee .

in addition , dhs could require any employer or class of employers to participate in the system with respect to individuals employed as of the date of enactment or hired after the date of enactment , if dhs designates such employer or class as a critical employer based on homeland security or national security needs or if dhs has reasonable cause to believe that the employer has materially violated the prohibitions on unauthorized employment .

under s. 2611 , individuals who are terminated from employment based on a determination by the verification system that they are not work eligible could obtain administrative and judicial review .

if they are determined to , in fact , be work eligible and prevail , they would be entitled to compensation for lost wages .

the current i - 9 system would remain in place with some modifications .

in addition , s. 2611 would increase monetary penalties for employer violations , and , like s. 2454 , would establish a new penalty for employees who falsely represent on the i - 9 form that they are authorized to work .

other pending bills , a selection of which are discussed below , would similarly require all employers to conduct employment eligibility verification through the basic pilot program or a similar system .

as detailed in the following paragraphs , some would maintain the basic pilot program's separation of the dhs and ssa databases as part of the verification system ; others call for the creation of a new unified database by dhs or ssa .

most of the measures would increase existing monetary penalties for employer violations .

among their other provisions , the bills variously would authorize appropriations at such sums as necessary to implement their provisions , and subject to the availability of appropriations , would authorize an increase in personnel to conduct worksite enforcement .

h.r .

98 , which was the subject of a may 2005 hearing by the house judiciary committee's subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims , would require social security cards to include an encrypted machine - readable electronic identification strip unique to the bearer and a digitized photograph .

under the bill , new hires would have to present a social security card of this type to their employers , who would use them to verify the worker's identity and work authorization .

employment eligibility verification would be conducted by accessing a database to be established by dhs that would contain dhs and ssa data .

h.r .

98 would raise maximum penalties for employers who violate prohibitions on unlawful employment .

section 402 of s. 1033 / h.r .

2330 would direct ssa to establish a new employment eligibility confirmation system through which employers would verify new hires' identity and work authorization .

the new system is to utilize machine - readable documents containing encrypted electronic information as a central feature .

ssa also would be tasked with designing and maintaining an employment eligibility database , which would include specified information about work - authorized noncitizens .

as described below in the section on guest workers , s. 1033 / h.r .

2330 would establish a new h - 5a temporary worker visa .

employers of these workers would be required to verify their identity and work authorization through the new database .

s. 1033 / h.r .

2330 would further direct ssa to develop a plan to phase out the current i - 9 system and place all workers into the new database .

title iii of s. 1438 would make various changes to current verification requirements .

it would require ssa to issue machine - readable , tamper - resistant social security cards .

these cards would become the only acceptable documents for evidencing employment authorization .

to establish identity , an individual would have to provide either a u.s. government - issued identification document containing a biometric identifier or a state - issued driver's license or identification document that conforms with real id act guidelines .

under s. 1438 , participation in the basic pilot program , which would be renamed , would be mandatory , and there would be sanctions for noncompliance .

in addition , s. 1438 would increase monetary penalties for employer violations .

s. 1917 would rename the basic pilot program and make participation mandatory .

participants in the verification system would be deemed to be in compliance with the i - 9 requirements .

s. 1917 would direct dhs to fully integrate all databases and data systems used in the verification system .

under the bill , the only acceptable documents for evidencing employment authorization would be a social security card or a machine - readable , tamper resistant card issued by the u.s. government that explicitly authorizes employment .

among its other provisions , s. 1917 would increase monetary penalties for employer violations .

h.r .

3333 would rename the basic pilot program and make participation mandatory , and sanction employers for noncompliance .

as under house - passed h.r .

4437 , employers would be required to verify that current employees , as well as new hires , are authorized to work .

h.r .

3333 would increase monetary penalties for employer violations .

in addition , it contains a number of provisions related to social security accounts and cards .

h.r .

3938 would rename the basic pilot program , make participation mandatory , and sanction employers for noncompliance .

at the same time , it proposes to create a new employment eligibility verification system , essentially identical to that proposed in h.r .

98 , to replace the renamed basic pilot program .

the new verification system would be based on an employment eligibility database , to be established by dhs , containing dhs and ssa data .

as explained in the above discussion of h.r .

98 , individuals commencing new employment would be required to present a social security card with an encrypted machine - readable electronic identification strip and a digitized photograph , which the employer would use to verify identity and work authorization through the new database .

h.r .

3938 also would increase monetary penalties for employer violations .

many contend that the smuggling of aliens into the united states constitutes a significant risk to national security and public safety .

since smugglers facilitate the illegal entry of persons into the united states , some maintain that terrorists may use existing smuggling routes and organizations to enter undetected .

in addition to generating billions of dollars in revenues for criminal enterprises , alien smuggling can lead to collateral crimes including kidnaping , homicide , assault , rape , robbery , auto theft , high speed flight , vehicle accidents , identity theft , and the manufacturing and distribution of fraudulent documents .

the main alien smuggling statute ( ina §274 ) delineates the criminal penalties , asset seizure rules , and prima facie evidentiary requirements for smuggling offenses .

several bills in the 109 th congress have provisions concerning alien smuggling .

among them is h.r .

2744 , the fy2006 agriculture appropriations bill , which was signed into law as p.l .

109-97 .

section 796 of this law specifies circumstances under which religious organizations are exempt from criminal penalties related to the smuggling and harboring of certain aliens , and states that it is not a violation of ina §274 for a bona fide , nonprofit , religious organization to encourage or allow an unauthorized alien to work for the religious organization as a volunteer minister or missionary .

under the provision , the alien must have been a member of the religious denomination for at least one year and may not be compensated as an employee , but may be provided room , board , travel , medical assistance , and other basic living expenses .

h.r .

4437 , as passed by the house , and s. 2611 , as passed by the senate , would rewrite ina §274 .

although the bills are similar , they are not identical in language or in scope .

both bills would broaden the types of acts that are considered alien smuggling .

for example , they would make it a smuggling offense to transport a person outside the united states knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the person is in unlawful transit from one country to another , or on the high - seas , and is seeking to illegally enter the united states .

s. 2611 would also provide new exemptions from criminal liability for persons or organizations providing assistance to unauthorized aliens on humanitarian grounds ( such exemptions are not contained in current law ) .

h.r .

4437 , in contrast , contains no such exemptions , and would also remove the current exemption contained in p.l .

109-97 for religious organizations that encourage certain unauthorized aliens to work for the organizations as volunteer ministers or missionaries .

in addition , h.r .

4437 and s. 2611 would establish mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of alien smuggling , and would enhance penalties for persons carrying firearms during smuggling offenses .

furthermore , as recommended in a recent government accountability office ( gao ) report on alien smuggling , both proposals would amend the law to allow for the seizure and forfeiture of any property used to commit or facilitate alien smuggling .

other pending bills would variously increase penalties or establish minimum penalties for alien smuggling ( h.r .

255 , h.r .

688 , h.r .

1320 , h.r .

3938 , s. 1916 , s. 2061 ) ; increase the personnel devoted solely to combating alien smuggling ( h.r .

688 ) ; and grant s visas to aliens outside the united states who have information on alien smuggling operations ( h.r .

255 , h.r .

2092 ) .

under the ina , there is broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination about whether the aliens should be removed from the united states .

the law mandates that certain categories of aliens be subject to mandatory detention ( i.e. , the aliens must be detained ) .

aliens subject to mandatory detention include those arriving without documentation or with fraudulent documentation , those who are inadmissible or deportable on criminal or national security grounds , those certified as terrorist suspects , and those who have final orders of deportation .

aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained , paroled , or released on bond .

the priorities for detention of these aliens are specified in statute and regulations .

there are many policy issues surrounding the detention of aliens .

among them are concerns about the number of aliens subject to mandatory detention and the justness of mandatory detention , especially as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation .

some have raised concerns about the length of time spent in detention by aliens who have been ordered removed .

additionally , the amount of detention space available to house dhs detainees is a constant issue , especially since many nondetained aliens fail to appear for their removal hearings or to depart from the united states after receiving final orders of deportation .

several bills in the 109 th congress , including house - passed h.r .

4437 and h.r .

6094 and senate - passed s. 2611 , contain provisions concerning the detention of aliens in the united states .

h.r .

4437 , h.r .

6094 , and s. 2611 would codify and modify the regulations governing the review of post - removal order detention cases for aliens who were lawfully admitted .

in addition , h.r .

4437 would require that as of october 1 , 2006 , all aliens attempting to illegally enter the united states who do not withdraw their applications for admission and depart immediately or who are not granted parole , be subject to mandatory detention until the alien is either removed or granted admission ; s. 2611 contains similar provisions .

h.r .

4437 also would authorize and establish the selection criteria for the secretary of dhs to contract with private entities to provide transportation to detention facilities and other locations for aliens apprehended along the border by cbp , and would require mandatory detention for aliens of street gangs .

 ( h.r .

6094 , as passed by the house , would also require the mandatory detention of aliens who are street gang members. ) .

s. 2611 would direct dhs to acquire or construct 20 additional detention facilities for aliens with a combined capacity of at least 10,000 aliens at any time , and would direct dhs to consider utilizing military installations approved for closure for this purpose .

a detention - related provision added as a senate floor amendment to s. 2611 would give the border patrol exclusive administrative and operational control over all assets utilized in carrying out its mission , which would include detention space .

h.r .

4437 , as passed by the house , and s. 2611 , as passed by the senate , would variously build on past legislative efforts , most recently the real id act , to tighten current law in the areas of illegal presence and illegal entry ; alien voluntary departure and removal from the united states ; alien exclusion from , or inadmissibility to , the united states ; and judicial review .

some h.r .

4437 - or s. 2611 - like provisions in these areas have been passed by one or both houses in other bills .

the ina provides for the temporary admission of various categories of foreign nationals , who are known as nonimmigrants .

nonimmigrants are admitted for a temporary period of time and a specific purpose .

they include a wide range of visitors , including tourists , foreign students , diplomats , and temporary workers .

the latter group is the subject of major legislation and considerable interest in the 109 th congress .

the main nonimmigrant category for temporary workers is the h visa .

among the visa classifications in the h visa category are the h - 1b visa for professional specialty workers , the h - 2a visa for agricultural workers , and the h - 2b visa for nonagricultural workers .

foreign nationals also may be temporarily admitted to the united states for work - or business - related purposes under other nonimmigrant categories , including the b - 1 visa for business visitors , the e visa for treaty traders and investors , and the l - 1 visa for intracompany transfers .

in addition to the admission of temporary workers and other temporary visitors , the ina provides for the admission of foreign nationals to the united states as lprs .

four elements underlie u.s. policy on permanent immigration: the reunification of families , the admission of immigrants with needed skills , the protection of refugees , and the diversity of admissions by country of origin .

various measures to revise permanent admissions have been introduced , but only one has been enacted thus far in the 109 th congress .

some , such as the enacted measure on visas for nurses , are narrowly targeted at particular aspects of the permanent immigration system .

others , including s. 2611 , s. 1033 / h.r .

2330 , s. 1438 , s. 2454 , and h.r .

3700 would broadly change permanent admissions .

some immigration reform bills before the 109 th congress contain highly controversial provisions to enable certain unauthorized aliens in the united states to adjust to lpr status .

in the case of s. 1033 / h.r .

2330 , as discussed in the section on guest workers above , a separate guest worker visa would be established for unauthorized aliens , who would then be able to adjust to lpr status through the permanent employment - based immigration system .

other bills , such as senate - passed s. 2611 , would establish legalization mechanisms separate from guest worker programs .

under title vi , subtitle a of s. 2611 , the secretary of dhs would adjust the status of an alien and the alien's spouse and minor children to lpr status if the alien meets specified requirements .

the alien would have to establish that he or she was physically present in the united states on or before april 5 , 2001 ; did not depart during the april 5 , 2001-april 5 , 2006 period except for brief departures ; and was not legally present as a nonimmigrant on april 5 , 2006 .

among the other requirements , the alien would have to establish employment for at least three years during the april 5 , 2001-april 5 , 2006 period and for at least six years after enactment , and would have to establish payment of income taxes during that required employment period .

such adjustments of status would not be subject to numerical limits .

also under title vi , subtitle a of s. 2611 , aliens who are unable to meet the presence and employment requirements for adjustment to lpr status but who have been present and employed in the united states since january 7 , 2004 , and meet other requirements , could apply to dhs for deferred mandatory departure ( dmd ) status .

eligible aliens would be granted dmd status for up to three years .

an alien in dmd status could apply for immigrant or nonimmigrant status while in the united states , but would have to depart the country in order to be admitted under such status .

the alien could exit the united states and immediately re - enter at certain land points of entry .

aliens granted dmd status who are subsequently admitted to the country as h - 2c aliens could apply to adjust to lpr status , as described above in the " guest workers " section .

title vi , subtitles b and c of s. 2611 contain additional provisions that would enable certain unauthorized aliens in the united states to apply for lpr status .

subtitle b would establish a "blue card" program for certain agricultural workers in the united states .

under the program , aliens who had performed requisite agricultural employment and meet other requirements would be able to obtain "blue card" status .

not more than 1.5 million blue cards could be issued during the five years beginning on the date of enactment .

after meeting additional requirements , blue card holders would be able to adjust to lpr status outside the ina's numerical limits .

subtitle c , known as the dream act , would enable aliens who first entered the united states before age 16 , have a high school diploma or the equivalent or have been admitted to an institution of higher education , and meet other requirement to apply for lpr status .

individuals who qualify would be granted lpr status on a conditional basis .

no numerical limitations would apply .

the conditional lpr status would be valid for six years , after which the alien could apply to have the condition removed subject to specified requirements .

during senate consideration of s. 2611 , several amendments to eliminate or modify legalization provisions in the bill were debated .

these included two unsuccessful amendments to delete the subtitle a and subtitle b legalization provisions for aliens who had been in the united states since april 5 , 2001 , and for agricultural workers ( s.amdt .

3963 ) , and to expand the subtitle a legalization program for those in the united states since april 5 , 2001 , to cover aliens in the country since january 1 , 2006 ( s.amdt .

4087 ) .

house - passed h.r .

4437 does not contain provisions to legalize the status of unauthorized aliens in the united states .

the ina includes a variety of provisions to assist aliens who have been victims of specified types of illegal activities , including domestic violence and trafficking .

many of these provisions were enacted as part of the ( 1 ) violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 ( p.l .

103-322 ) , which included the original violence against women act ( vawa ) ; ( 2 ) victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 ( vtvpa ; p.l .

106-386 ) , which included vawa 2000 ; and ( 3 ) trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of 2003 ( p.l .
