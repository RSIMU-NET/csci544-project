the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act , 1999 ( p.l .

105-277 , h.r .

4328 ) was signed into law on october 21 , 1998 .

contained within the measure was $55.9 billion in regular fy1999appropriations for the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and related agencies and an additional $5.9 billioninemergency supplemental spending for farm economic and disaster assistance .

usda appropriations were foldedinto theomnibus bill after the president vetoed the conference agreement ( h.r .

4101 ) on fy1999 funding for usdaand related agencies on october 7 , because the emergency spending provisions in the bill did not include an increaseinloan rates ( price guarantees ) for farmers .

p.l .

105-277 does not provide for an increase in loan rates , but the $5.9inemergency assistance provided is $1.7 billion above the amount provided in the vetoed bill .

the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) carries out its widely varied responsibilities through approximately30separate internal agencies staffed by some 100,000 employees .

usda is responsible for many activities outsideof theagriculture budget function .

hence , spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farmers .

usda net outlays ( after adjustment for offsetting receipts ) for the most recently completed fiscal year ( fy1997 ) were$52.5 billion .

by far the largest outlay within the department , $35.9 billion ( 67% ) of total outlays in fy1997 , wasfor itsfood and nutrition programs , primarily the food stamp program ( the costliest of all usda programs ) , various childnutrition programs , and the women , infants and children ( wic ) program .

total fy1997 outlays also included $8.9billion ( 17% ) for farm and foreign agricultural services .

within this mission area of usda are the programs fundedthrough thecommodity credit corporation ( eg , commodity support payments , the conservation reserve program , and certaintradeprograms ) , crop insurance , farm loans , and foreign food aid programs .

another $4.2 billion ( 8% ) was spent on anarray ofnatural resource and environment programs , nearly three - fourths of which funds the forest service ( which is fundedthrough the interior appropriations bill , not the agriculture appropriations bill ) , and the balance for a number ofconservation programs for farm producers .

usda programs for research and education ( $1.8 billion in outlays for fy1997 ) , rural development ( $1.35 billion ) ,marketing and regulatory activities , $708 million ) , meat and poultry inspection ( $574 million ) , and departmentalactivities ( $309 million ) accounted for the balance of usda spending .

congressional action on fy1999 appropriations for the u.s. department ofagriculture and related agencies *the conference report on h.r .

4101 was vetoed by the president on october 7 , 1998 .

fy1999 appropriationsfor usda and related agencies were ultimately included in the omnibus consolidated and emergencyappropriations act,1999 ( p.l .

105-277 , h.r .

4328 ) , which was approved by the house on 10 / 20 / 98 by a 333-95 vote , by thesenate on 10 / 21 / 98 by a vote of 65-29 , and signed into law on october 21 , 1998 .

the conference agreement on the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill ( p.l .

105-277 / h.r .

4328 ) wassignedinto law on october 21 , 1998 .

the measure contains $55.9 billion in regular fy1999 appropriations for usdaand relatedagencies and $5.9 billion in emergency funding to help farmers recover from natural disasters and low crop prices .

the house and senate earlier had approved a separate conference agreement for fy1999 usda appropriations ( h.r .

4101 ) on october 2 and october 6 , 1998 , respectively .

however , the president vetoed the measure onoctober 7 , because the emergency spending provisions in the bill did not include a senate democraticleadership - supportedincrease in loan rates ( price guarantees ) for farmers .

the vetoed measure included $55.9 billion in new budgetauthority , and $4.2 billion in emergency assistance .

republican leadership opposed any increase in loan rates , but instead agreed to an increase in the amount of emergencyfarm assistance provided from $4.2 billion in the vetoed bill ( h.r .

4101 ) to $5.9 billion in p.l .

105-277 .

abudget emergency was declared for this amount , which by definition requires no budgetary offsets for the newspending .

 ( see "emergency supplemental farm assistance" below for details .

the $55.9 billion in regular ( non - emergency ) fy1999 appropriations for usda and related agencies in p.l .

105-277 isabout equal to the house - passed level of h.r .

4101 , $1.3 billion below the senate - passed level ( s. 2159 ) , and nearly $3 billion below the administration request .

of this amount , $42.25 billion is formandatory programs and $13.69 billion for discretionary spending .

with only a few exceptions , the $55.9 billion provided to usda and related agencies in p.l .

105-277 is nearly identical to amounts provided in the vetoed conference agreement on h.r .

4101 .

the major differences are that p.l.105-277 provides $23.3 million more for the president's food safety initiative spread out among fda and severalusdaagencies , and $15 million more for rural empowerment zones and enterprise communities programs within usda'sruraldevelopment programs .

total non - emergency budget authority in p.l .

105-277 for usda and related agencies is significantly higher than the$49.55 billion appropriated in fy1998 , which is mainly attributable to a change in the formula for determining howmuchis required to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for its net realized losses .

 ( see "farm commodityprograms"below for details. ) .

a significant portion of the $1.1 billion difference between the total amounts provided in h.r .

4101 and s. 2159 is in the amount provided for food stamps .

the house based itsprojections on more recent economic forecasts that show lower average participation and benefits than previouslywereprojected .

the following is a review of the major usda and related agencies provisions of p.l .

105-277 , the house - and senate - passed bills ( h.r .

4101 and s. 2159 ) , and the administration request for fy1999 funding .

 ( see table 3 at the end of this report for a program - by - program comparison of p.l .

105-277 with the house andsenatebills , the fy1999 request , and actual fy1998 appropriations. ) .

the food and drug administration ( fda ) is funded through both congressional appropriations and user feeswhose totallevel of collections is set each year by the appropriations committees .

the most contentious provisions are in thefundinglevels for salaries and expenses ( s&e ) and in one user fee program .

the omnibus fy1999 appropriations act ( p.l.105-277 ) increases fda's s&e program level to $970.9 million , a 13% increase over fy1998 , and allows$132.3 millionfor prescription drug user fee act ( pdufa ) collections , also a 13% increase over fy1998 .

the total programlevel ( s&eplus user fees ) for fy1999 is $1.117 billion .

included for the first time in the s&e account is $83 million for rental payments to be paid to the general servicesadministration ( gsa ) .

the act includes a provision that will allow $5.428 million of pdufa funds to betransferred andmerged in the s&e account and used for payment of gsa rentals .

thus , a total of $88 million will be madeavailable forrental payments in the s&e account .

separately , p.l .

105-277 provides $11.35 million for fda buildings andfacilities .

p.l .

105-277 maintains the fy1998 appropriation level of $34 million to fund tobacco outreach and enforcement activities,and also continues support for the president's food safety initiative ( fsi ) .

the president had requested an additional$50million in direct appropriations for fda for fsi activities .

the act appropriates a $25 million increase .

theconfereesexpect fda to use $24.5 million of this total amount for increased food inspections , and $500,000 for research bythenational center for toxicological research .

the fy1999 appropriations act also includes $250,000 for the office of seafood inspection .

within this amount,$200,000 is to be used to continue the grant to the interstate shellfish sanitation committee .

it also directs fdato use$500,000 to develop the system and regulations necessary to implement a new food packaging materials notificationprogram by may 1999 .

the conferees strongly urge fda to finalize a rule within one year after receiving a citizen'spetition on the use of "and / or" in the labeling of types of fish contained in surimi .

conferees increased theappropriation by$2.5 million for the cosmetic and color regulatory program .

conferees also expect fda to publish by june 1 , 1999 , a proposed rule concerning the use of foreign marketingdata in thereview of new sun - screen active ingredients in the over - the - counter drug monograph on sun - screen products .

alsoincludedin the bill is $3 million in construction funds for the third phase of construction of fda arkansas regionallaboratory ( arl ) in jefferson , arkansas .

the project will need approximately $13.3 million to be completed .

p.l .

105-277 prohibits fda from closing or relocating its division of drug analysis in st louis , mo , appropriates $1million for the office of generic drugs , and appropriates $700,000 for competitive grants under the clinicalpharmacologyprogram .

p.l .

105-277 urges fda to issue new regulations and guidance for the generic drug industry manufacturers who file anabbreviated new drug application ( anda ) which relies on the fda's previous determination that the drug is safeandeffective , thus avoiding submitting new safety and effectiveness studies .

the act also refines the definition ofantibacterialingredients to exempt a certain class in animal drugs .

not included in p.l .

105-277 is senate bill language on metered - dose inhalers ( mdis ) , which are used to treat asthma andother chronic lung diseases .

under the montreal protocol , the fda is required to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ) in mdis and approve new devices that use a less environmentally damaging propellent compound .

thesenatedirected fda to gather information on safe and effective non - cfc mdis , which meet patients needs , before phasingoutcfc devices .

another senate provision that was not included in the final act is a requirement for country of origin labeling for freshproduce .

instead , the bill directs the general accounting office ( gao ) to study the potential effects of mandatorycountryof origin labeling of fresh produce and submit a report to congress no later than 6 months after enactment of thisact .

regulatory jurisdiction over derivative financial contracts - - contracts whose value depends on changes in theprice ofsome underlying commodity or financial instrument - - has been a contentious issue for several years .

thecommodityfutures trading commission ( cftc ) has jurisdiction over derivative contracts ( futures contracts and some options ) tradedon the futures exchanges .

however , several other forms of derivatives ( eg , certain contracts based on foreigncurrenciesor u.s. treasury securities ) are exempted by law from cftc regulation .

currently , attention focuses on swapcontracts,which are the basis of a booming international market in off - exchange , or over - the - counter , derivatives .

swapsresemblefutures in their economic function , but the major dealers - - banks and affiliates of securities firms - - are notinstitutionsthat have traditionally been regulated by the cftc .

no agency has overall regulatory jurisdiction , and there is someconcern that the present fragmented regulatory structure might have difficulty responding to a crisis in the swapsmarket,which might have wide repercussions throughout the international financial system .

in may 1998 , the cftc published a "concept release" announcing its intention to evaluate current regulation of swaps andto consider whether they should be subject to some or all of the requirements of the commodity exchange act,whichgoverns exchange - traded futures .

the securities and exchange commission and the banking regulators objectedto thiscftc initiative , stating that 1 ) existing regulation of over - the - counter derivatives was adequate , and 2 ) that if newregulation was necessary , it should be formulated by the various financial regulators as a group , rather than byunilateralaction of a single agency .

the swaps industry argued that even raising the possibility of cftc regulation might castdoubtover the legal enforceability of swaps contracts and drive the business offshore .

in response to these concerns , the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act ( p.l .

105-277 ) imposes a "restraint period" on thecftc , directing it not to issue or propose any new rule or regulation affecting swaps or "hybrid" financialinstrumentsbefore march 30 , 1999 .
