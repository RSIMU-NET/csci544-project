the ryan white hiv / aids program makes federal funds available to metropolitan areas and states to provide a number of health care services for hiv / aids patients including medical care , drug treatments , dental care , home health care , and outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment .

the program currently serves more than half a million low - income people with hiv / aids in the united states ; 29% of those served are uninsured , and an additional 56% are underinsured .

the ryan white program was established in law in 1990 ( p.l .

101-381 ) and reauthorized and amended in 1996 ( p.l .

104-146 ) , 2000 ( p.l .

106-345 ) , 2006 ( p.l .

109-415 ) , and 2009 ( p.l .

111-87 ) .

it was enacted as title xxvi of the public health service ( phs ) act and codified as parts a , b , c , d , e , f , and g under 42 u.s.c .

§ 300ff - 11 et seq .

the program is administered by the hrsa hiv / aids bureau .

most ryan white funding is distributed to eligible entities based on formulas that take into account living cases of hiv / aids .

funding for the individual grant programs ( parts a , b , c , d , and f ) is shown in figure 1 and in table 1 at the end of this report .

ryan white funding , fy2012total = $2.4 billionsource: hrsa , fy2013 justification of estimates for appropriations committees , p. 238-271 .

p.l .

111-87 provided specific authorization levels for parts a , b , c , d , and f for each fiscal year through fy2013 , resulting in a four - year reauthorization for the ryan white program .

p.l .

111-87 required that the secretary establish a national hiv / aids testing goal of 5 million tests annually through programs administered by hrsa and cdc .

the secretary is required to submit an annual report to congress on the progress made in achieving the testing goal , including any barriers to meeting the goal , the amount of funding necessary to meet the goal , and the most cost - effective strategies for identifying individuals who are unaware of their hiv status .

the secretary is also required to review each of the programs and activities conducted by cdc as part of the domestic hiv / aids prevention activities .

the other provisions of p.l .

111-87 are discussed below in the sections of this report on the various parts of the ryan white program .

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 ( aca , p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance and which , therefore , should increase coverage for people living with hiv / aids .

they include prohibitions on the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition , elimination of lifetime caps on insurance benefits and annual limits on coverage , and eligibility for tax subsidies to assist low - and middle - income individuals in the purchase of coverage from health insurance exchanges .

in addition , at state option , medicaid eligibility will be broadened to include single adults , and aca phases out the medicare part d so - called doughnut hole for hiv / aids individuals who are medicare eligible .

the long - range impact of the health care law on hrsa's ryan white program ( meaning the replacement of health and treatment services provided under ryan white with access to such services through health coverage via aca ) remains to be determined .

as mentioned previously , aca ( p.l .

111-148 , as amended ) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance for the u.s. population as well as coverage for people living with hiv / aids .

obtaining private health insurance has been difficult for individuals with hiv / aids and others living with serious preexisting medical conditions .

a 2011 institute of medicine ( iom ) report estimated that in urban areas , only about 13% of hiv patients in 2010 had private health insurance ; most hiv patients were covered by medicaid ( 36% ) , medicare ( 12% ) , or a combination of these two programs ( 6% ) .

the remaining individuals were either uninsured and obtained their coverage through the ryan white program ( 24% ) , or their insurance coverage information was missing or unknown ( 8% ) .

p.l .

111-87 provided authority for ryan white parts a , b , c , d , and f through fy2013 .

in addition , section 2 ( a ) of p.l .

111-87 removed the sunset provision that had been included in the 2006 reauthorization ( §703 of p.l .

109-415 ) .

if reauthorization of the ryan white program does not occur before october 1 , 2013 , it may continue to operate under general authority ( title iii ) of the phs act .

the long - range impact of aca on the ryan white program — meaning the replacement of health and treatment services provided under ryan white with access to such services through health coverage via aca — remains to be determined .

if aca remains intact moving forward , some states may decide not to participate in the medicaid expansion .

in those states , the need for the full range of services under ryan white would remain .

however , even if all states decide to cover the new medicaid eligible group provided under aca , there will be gaps that the ryan white program could continue to fill , such as coverage of those individuals with hiv / aids who are undocumented immigrants or legal immigrants within the five - year medicaid ban .

in addition , ryan white provides dental care and support services , such as transportation , that may not be provided under medicaid or private health insurance .

following full implementation of aca , there are concerns about whether there will be enough physicians to care for individuals who were previously uninsured .

there may also be shortages in particular geographical areas or certain specialists , such as primary care or those who are knowledgeable about hiv / aids .

during the month of july 2012 , hrsa conducted a series of four listening sessions to allow stakeholders , including ryan white grantees , advocacy organizations , state and local administrators , and others to provide comments on all aspects of the ryan white program in preparation for reauthorization .

for fy2012 , the obama administration requested a total of $2.376 billion for the ryan white program , an increase of $88 million compared with fy2010 ; most of the increase ( $82 million ) would go to adap .

the increase in adap funding would provide hiv medications for an estimated 13,000 additional patients .

hrsa would use $60 million for a new supplemental grant program for state adap programs with waiting lists or other cost containment measures .

in a speech on december 1 , 2011 , world aids day , president obama indicated that that his administration would commit an additional $35 million for adap and an additional $15 million for the ryan white program .

the senate appropriations committee reported s. 1599 , the fy2012 labor / hhs / education bill , on september 22 , 2011 ( s.rept .

112-84 ) .

the senate bill would provide $2.327 billion to hrsa for the ryan white program .

the house appropriations committee did not report a labor / hhs bill for fy2012 , but the chairman of the subcommittee introduced h.r .

3070 on september 29 , 2011 , accompanied by a detailed funding table ; the amount for the ryan white program was $2.312 billion .

congress provided temporary funding for ryan white under several continuing resolutions while it completed final action on fy2012 appropriations: p.l .

112-33 provided funding through october 4 , 2011 ; p.l .

112-36 provided funding through november 18 , 2011 ; p.l .

112-55 provided funding through december 16 , 2011 ; h.j.res .

94 provided funding through december 17 , 2011 ; and h.j.res .

95 provided funding through december 23 , 2011 .

h.r .

2055 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2012 , provided , in division f , $2.327 billion for the ryan white program .

however , section 527 of division f also contained an across - the - board rescission of 0.189% .

the bill passed the house on december 16 , the senate on december 17 , and was signed by the president on december 23 , 2011 .

for fy2013 , the obama administration requested a total of $2.447 billion for the ryan white program , an increase of $79.594 million compared with fy2012 ; most of the increase ( $66.701 million ) would go to adap .

the fy2013 request would also provide an increase of $20.478 million for part c grants and a decrease of $7.585 million for part d grants .

the senate appropriations committee reported s. 3295 , the fy2013 labor / hhs / education bill , on june 14 , 2012 ( s.rept .

112-176 ) .

the senate bill would provide $2.397 billion to hrsa for the ryan white program .

the house appropriations committee did not report a labor / hhs bill for fy2013 .

congress provided temporary funding , through march 27 , 2013 , for the ryan white program in p.l .

112-175 , the continuing appropriations resolution , 2013 .

funding is at the fy2012 rate plus a very slight increase ( less than 1% ) .

under the budget control act of 2011 ( bca , p.l .

112-25 ) , a sequestration ( automatic across - the - board spending cuts ) is scheduled to occur on january 2 , 2013 , unless congress enacts legislation modifying the bca .

on september 14 , 2013 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) released a report providing preliminary estimates on the potential impact of the sequestration .

the omb report indicates that hrsa discretionary programs , such as ryan white , could receive an 8.2% cut due to the sequestration in fy2013 .
