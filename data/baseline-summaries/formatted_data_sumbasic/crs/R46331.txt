this report describes selected health care - related provisions that are scheduled to expire during the second session of the 116 th congress ( i.e. , during calendar year [cy] 2020 ) .

for purposes of this report , expiring provisions are defined as portions of law that are time - limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached , absent further legislative action .

the expiring provisions included in this report are those related to medicare , medicaid , the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and private health insurance programs and activities .

the report also includes health care - related provisions enacted in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 ) or extended under the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act ; p.l .

116-136 ) .

this report describes health care - related provisions within the same scope that expired during the first session of the 116 th congress ( i.e. , during cy2019 ) .

although the congressional research service ( crs ) has attempted to be comprehensive , it cannot guarantee that every relevant provision is included here .

the two types of provisions discussed in this report generally are enacted in the context of authorization laws and thus are typically within the purview of congressional authorizing committees .

the duration that a provision is in effect usually is regarded as creating a timeline for legislative decisionmaking .

in choosing this timeline , congress navigates tradeoffs between the frequency of congressional review and the stability of funding or other legal requirements that pertain to the program .

the first type of provision in this report provides or controls mandatory spending , meaning it provides temporary funding , temporary increases or decreases in funding ( eg , medicare provider bonus payments ) , or temporary special protections that may result in changes in funding levels ( eg , medicare funding provisions that establish a floor ) .

the second type of provision defines the authority of government agencies or other entities to act , usually by authorizing a policy , project , or activity .

such provisions also may temporarily delay the implementation of a regulation , requirement , or deadline , or establish a moratorium on a particular activity .

expiring health care provisions that are predominantly associated with discretionary spending activitiesâsuch as discretionary authorizations of appropriations and authorities for discretionary user feesâare excluded from this report .

certain types of provisions with expiration dates that otherwise would meet the criteria set forth above are also excluded from this report .

some of these provisions are excluded , because they are transitional or routine in nature or have been superseded by congressional action that otherwise modifies the intent of the expiring provision .

for example , statutorily required medicare payment rate reductions and payment rate re - basings that are implemented over a specified period are not considered to require legislative attention and are excluded .

the report is organized as follows: table 1 lists the relevant provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2020 .

table 2 lists the relevant provisions that expired during 2019 .

the provisions in each table are organized by expiration date and applicable health care - related program .

the report then describes each listed provision , including a legislative history .

the summaries are grouped by provisions scheduled to expire in 2020 followed by those that expired in 2019 .

appendix a lists demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2020 or that expired in 2019 and are related to medicare , medicaid , chip , and private health insurance programs and activities or other health care - related provisions that were enacted in the aca or last extended under the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) .

appendix b lists the status of provisions included in crs report r45781 , health care - related expiring provisions of the 116th congress , first session , that did not apply within the scope of this report .

appendix c lists all laws that created , modified , or extended the health care - related expiring provisions described in this report .

appendix d lists abbreviations used in the report .

the pregnancy assistance fund ( paf ) program focuses on meeting the educational , social service , and health needs of vulnerable expectant and parenting individuals and their families during pregnancy and the postnatal period .

the program identifies eligible populations as expectant and parenting teens , college students , and women of any age who experience domestic violence , sexual violence , sexual assault , or stalking .

hhs administers the paf program , and funding is awarded competitively to the 50 states , dc , u.s. territories , and tribal entities ( hereinafter , grantees ) that apply successfully .

grantees may use funds ( 1 ) to establish , operate , or maintain pregnancy or parenting services at institutions of higher education ( ihes ) , high schools , or community service providers ; ( 2 ) to provide , in partnership with the state attorney general's office , certain legal and supportive services for women who experience domestic violence , sexual violence , sexual assault , or stalking while they are pregnant or parenting an infant ; and ( 3 ) to support , either directly or through a subgrantee , public awareness about paf services for the expectant and parenting population that is eligible for the program .

aca , section 10212 , established paf and provided $25 million annually from fy2010 through fy2019 .

funding authorized under the aca expired after september 30 , 2019 .

section 101 of macra made fundamental changes to the way medicare payments to physicians are determined and how they are updated .

to implement the payment modifications in section 101 of macra , the law authorized the transfer of $80 million from the smi trust fund for each fiscal year beginning with fy2015 and ending with fy2019 .

the amounts transferred are to be available until expended .

macra , section 101 , provided for the transfer of $80 million , for each of fy2015 through fy2019 , from the medicare smi trust fund .

appropriated funds to support the activities under this subsection have not been enacted for fy2020 or subsequent fiscal years .

ssa section 1848 ( s ) required the hhs secretary to develop a plan for the development of quality measures for use in the mips program , which is to be updated as needed .

the subsection also requires the secretary to enter into contracts or other arrangements to develop , improve , update , or expand quality measures , in accordance with the plan .

in entering into contracts , the secretary must give priority to developing measures of outcomes , patient experience of care , and care coordination , among other things .

the hhs secretary , through cms , annually reports on the progress made in developing quality measures under this subsection .

macra , section 102 , provided for the transfer of $15 million , for each of fy2015 through fy2019 , from the medicare smi trust fund .

appropriated funds to support the activities under this subsection have not been enacted for fy2020 or subsequent fiscal years .

however , funds appropriated prior to fy2020 are available for obligation through the end of fy2022 .

medicare pays ltchs for certain inpatient hospital care under the ltch prospective payment system ( ltch pps ) , which is typically higher than payments for inpatient hospital care under the inpatient prospective payment system ( ipps ) .

psra amended the law so that the ltch pps payment is no longer available for all ltch discharges but instead is available only for those ltch discharges that met specific clinical criteria .

specifically , ltchs are paid under the ltch pps if a medicare beneficiary either ( 1 ) had a prior three - day intensive - care - unit stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay or ( 2 ) is assigned to an ltch pps case - mix group that is based on the receipt of ventilator services for at least 96 hours and had a prior hospital stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay .

discharges involving patients who have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or rehabilitation do not qualify for the ltch pps rate .

subsequent legislation provided for other criteria to temporarily receive payment under the ltch pps .

see section " temporary exception for certain spinal cord conditions from application of the medicare ltch site neutral payment for certain ltchs ( ssaâ â§1886 ( m ) ( 6 ) ( f ) ; 42â u.s.c.â â§1395ww ( m ) ( 6 ) ( f ) ) . .

for ltch discharges that did not qualify for the ltch pps based on these clinical criteria , a "site neutral payment rate" similar to the pps for inpatient acute care hospitals ( ipps ) was to be phased - in .

the site neutral rate is defined as the lower of an "ipps - comparable" per diem amount , as defined in regulations , or the estimated cost of the services involved .

psra , section 1206 ( a ) , established patient criteria for payment under the ltch pps and a site neutral payment rate for ltch patients who do not meet these criteria .

during a phase - in period for discharges in cost - reporting periods beginning in fy2016 and fy2017 , ltchs received a blended payment amount based on 50% of what the ltch would have been reimbursed under the ltch pps rate and 50% of the site neutral payment rate .

for cost - reporting periods beginning in fy2018 and subsequent years , the ltch was to receive the site neutral payment rate .

bba 2018 , section 51005 , extended the transition period to site neutral medicare payments for ltch patients who do not meet the patient criteria for an additional two years , to include discharges in cost - reporting periods beginning during fy2018 and fy2019 .

during this period , ltchs continue to receive the 50 / 50 blended payment for discharges that do not meet certain ltch pps criteria .

the extended transition period to site neutral payments during which ltchs receive a blended payment for discharges that do not meet the patient criteria expired for discharges occurring in cost - reporting periods beginning during fy2020 and subsequent years .

medicare pays ltchs for inpatient hospital care under the ltch pps , which is typically higher than payments for inpatient hospital care under the ipps .

effective for cost - reporting periods beginning in fy2016 , ltchs are paid the ltch pps rate for patients that meet one of the following two criteria: ( 1 ) had a prior three - day intensive - care - unit stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay or ( 2 ) is assigned to an ltch pps case - mix group that is based on the receipt of ventilator services for at least 96 hours and had a prior hospital stay at a hospital paid under the ipps immediately preceding the ltch stay .

discharges involving patients who have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or rehabilitation do not qualify for the ltch pps rate .

for ltch discharges that did not qualify for the ltch pps based on these criteria , a site neutral payment rate is being phased - in for cost - reporting periods beginning fy2016 through fy2019 .

subsequent legislation provided for other criteria to temporarily receive payment under the ltch pps .

see section " temporary extension of long - term care hospital ( ltch ) site neutral payment policy transition period ( ssaâ â§1886 ( m ) ( 6 ) ( b ) ( i ) ; 42â u.s.c.â â§1395ww ( m ) ( 6 ) ( b ) ( i ) ) " for details related to site neutral payment .

the 21 st century cures act ( cures act ; p.l .

114-255 ) , division c , section 15009 , established an additional temporary criterion for payment under the ltch pps related to certain spinal cord conditions for discharges occurring in cost - reporting periods fy2018 and fy2019 .

specifically , the ltch pps rate would apply to an ltch discharge if all of the following are met: ( 1 ) the ltch was a not - for - profit on june 1 , 2014 ; ( 2 ) at least 50% of the ltch's cy2013 ltch pps - paid discharges were classified under ltch diagnosis related groups ( drgs ) associated with catastrophic spinal cord injuries , acquired brain injury , or other paralyzing neuromuscular conditions ; and ( 3 ) the ltch during fy2014 discharged patients ( including medicare beneficiaries and others ) who had been admitted from at least 20 of the 50 states , as determined by the hhs secretary based on a patient's state of residency .

the authority for the temporary criterion related to certain spinal cord conditions to receive payment under the ltch pps expired for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods during fy2020 and for subsequent years .

currently , medicare payments for services of physicians and certain non - physician practitioners , including radiation therapy services , are made on the basis of a fee schedule .

to set payment rates under the mpfs , relative values units ( rvus ) are assigned to each of more than 7,000 service codes that reflect physician work ( i.e. , the time , skill , and intensity it takes to provide the service ) , practice expenses , and malpractice costs .

the relative value for a service compares the relative work and other inputs involved in performing one service with the inputs involved in providing other physicians' services .

the relative values are adjusted for geographic variation in input costs .

the adjusted relative values are then converted into a dollar payment amount by a conversion factor .

cms , which is responsible for maintaining and updating the fee schedule , continually modifies and refines the methodology for estimating rvus .

cms is required to review the rvus no less than every five years ; the aca added the requirement that the hhs secretary periodically identify physician services as being potentially misvalued , and make appropriate adjustments to the relative values of such services under the medicare physician fee schedule .

in determining adjustments to rvus used as the basis for calculating medicare physician reimbursement under the fee schedule , the hhs secretary has authority , under previously existing law and as augmented by the aca , to adjust the number of rvus for any service code to take into account changes in medical practice , coding changes , new data on relative value components , or the addition of new procedures .

under the potentially misvalued codes authority , certain radiation therapy codes were identified as being potentially misvalued in 2015 .

however , because of concerns that the existing code set did not accurately reflect the radiation therapy treatments identified , cms created several new codes during the transition toward an episodic alternative payment model .

patient access and medicare protection act ( pampa ; p.l .

114-115 ) , required cms to apply the same code definitions , work rvus , and direct inputs for the practice expense rvus in cy2017 and cy2018 as applied in 2016 for these transition codes , effectively keeping the payments for these services unchanged , subject to the annual update factor .

pampa exempted these radiation therapy and related imaging services from being considered as potentially misvalued services under cms's misvalued codes initiative for cy2017 and cy2018 .

pampa also instructed the hhs secretary to report to congress on the development of an episodic alternative payment model under the medicare program for radiation therapy services furnished in non - facility settings .

bba 2018 section 51009 , extended the restrictions through cy2019 .

the payment restrictions expired after december 31 , 2019 .

appendix a .

demonstration projects and pilotâ programs this appendix lists selected health care - related demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire during the second session of the 116 th congress ( i.e. , during calendar year [cy] 2020 ) .

the expiring demonstration projects and pilot programs listed below have portions of law that are time - limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached , absent further legislative action .

the expiring demonstration projects and pilot programs included here are those related to medicare , medicaid , the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and private health insurance programs and activities .

this appendix also includes health care - related demonstration projects and pilot programs that were enacted in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 ) or extended in the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security act ( cares act ; p.l .

116-136 ) .

no relevant demonstration projects and pilot programs within the same scope expired during the first session of the 116 th congress ( i.e. , during cy2019 ) .

although crs has attempted to be comprehensive , it cannot guarantee that every relevant demonstration project and pilot program is included here .

table a - 1 lists the relevant demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2020 .

appendix b .

provisions included in the previous crs health care - related expiring provisionsâ report this appendix provides information on the provisions that were included in the previous crs report on health care - related expiring provisions ( crs report r45781 , health care - related expiring provisions of the 116th congress , first session ) henceforth referred to as "r45781," but were not detailed in the body of this report .

as does the current report , r45781 included expiring provisions ( of the same two types discussed herein ) related to medicare , medicaid , state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and private health insurance programs and activities as well as selected other health care - related provisions .

r45781 included health care - related provisions that were enacted in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .

111-148 ) or , at the time of publication , had been extended under the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l .

115-123 ) .

r45781 also described health care - related provisions that , at the time of publication , were set to expire during the first session of the 116 th congress ( i.e. , during calendar year [cy] 2019 ) or had expired during the 115 th congress ( i.e. , during cy2017 or cy2018 ) .

some of the provisions detailed in r45781 fell within the scope of this report .

such provisions expired in cy2019 or were extended and are set to expire in cy2020 .

table b - 1 includes the provisions detailed in r45781 that remain expired or were extended to dates beyond the 116 th congress ( i.e. , after cy2020 ) .

the third column in table b - 1 provides each provision's expiration date as it was in r45781 .

the fourth column reflects updated information , indicating whether the expiration date remains "unchanged" by law or providing the current expiration date for provisions extended pursuant to congressional modification .

two private health insurance provisions were included in r45781 that did not meet the report criteria but were set to expire in 2019 .

these provisions modified fees and taxes established by the aca to help fund aca activities , including those related to private health insurance .

as reflected in table b - 1 , those fee and tax provisions were permanently repealed in the further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) .

unlike the other provisions that were included in r45781 and were extended past cy2020 , the extension for the patient - centered outcomes research trust fund ( pcortf ) was legislatively undertaken in a manner that resulted in significant revisions to the program and / or funding mechanisms detailed in r45781 .

because of this , this appendix includes an updated provision summary below table b - 1 .

see , "patient - centered outcomes research trust fund ( irc â§9511 and â§â§4375-4377 , ssa â§1183 ; 26 u.s.c .

â§9511 ; 26 u.s.c .

â§â§4375-4377 ; 42 u.s.c .

â§1320e - 2 ) . .

for more detailed background information on the other provisions included in table b - 1 , see crs report r45781 , health care - related expiring provisions of the 116th congress , first session .

table b - 1 does not include demonstration projects or pilot programs .

the only project or program in appendix a of r45781 that was not included in this report is the demonstration program to increase access to dental health care service .

the demonstration program expired after march 23 , 2017 .

â§9511 ; 26 u.s.c .

â§â§4375-4377 ; 42 u.s.c .

â§1320e - 2 ) background ssa section 1181 establishes the patient - centered outcomes research institute ( pcori ) , which is responsible for coordinating and supporting comparative clinical effectiveness research .

pcori has entered into contracts with federal agencies , as well as with academic and private sector research entities for both the management of funding and conduct of research .

phsa section 937 requires the agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) to broadly disseminate research findings that are published by pcori and other government - funded comparative effectiveness research entities .

irc section 9511 establishes the patient - centered outcomes research trust fund to support the activities of pcori and to fund activities under phsa section 937 .

it provides annual funding to the pcortf over the period fy2010-fy2019 from the following three sources: ( 1 ) annual appropriations , ( 2 ) fees on health insurance policies and self - insured plans , and ( 3 ) transfers from the medicare hi and smi trust funds .

ssa section 1183 provides for the transfer of the required funds from the medicare trust funds .

transfers to pcortf from the medicare hi and smi trust funds are calculated based on the number of individuals entitled to benefits under medicare part a or enrolled in medicare part b. irc sections 4375-4377 impose the referenced fees on applicable health insurance policies and self - insured health plans and describe the method for their calculation .

for each of fy2011 through fy2019 , irc section 9511 requires 80% of the pcortf funds to be made available to pcori , and the remaining 20% of funds to be transferred to the hhs secretary for carrying out phsa section 937 .

of the total amount transferred to hhs , 80% is to be distributed to ahrq , with the remainder going to the office of the secretary ( os ) / hhs .

relevant legislation aca , section 6301 , provided the following amounts to the pcortf: ( 1 ) $10 million for fy2010 , ( 2 ) $50 million for fy2011 , and ( 3 ) $150 million for each of fy2012 through fy2019 .

in addition , for each of fy2013 through fy2019 , the section provided an amount equivalent to the net revenues from a new fee that the law imposed on health insurance policies and self - insured plans .

for policy / plan years ending during fy2013 , the fee equals $1 multiplied by the average number of covered lives .

for policy / plan years ending during each subsequent fiscal year through fy2019 , the fee equals $2 multiplied by the average number of covered lives .

finally , the section ( in addition to aca section 6301 ( d ) ) provided for transfers to pcortf from the medicare part a and part b trust funds ; these are generally calculated by multiplying the average number of individuals entitled to benefits under medicare part a , or enrolled in medicare part b , by $1 ( for fy2013 ) or by $2 ( for each of fy2014 through fy2019 ) .

under this provision , pcortf was to terminate on september 30 , 2019 .

continu ing appropriations act , 2020 , and health extenders act of 2019 ( p.l .

116-59 ) , section 1403 , extended the termination date of pcortf through november 21 , 2019 .

further continuing appropriations act , 2020 , and further health extenders act of 2019 ( p.l .

116-69 ) , section 1403 , further extended the termination date of pcortf through december 20 , 2019 .

further consolidated appropriations act , 2020 ( p.l .

116-94 ) , division n , section 104 , extends funding for pcortf through fy2029 by appropriating both the amount equivalent to the net revenues received from the fees on health insurance policies and self - insured plans and providing a direct appropriation in a specified amount ( the "applicable amount" ) for each of fiscal years 2020 through 2029 .

the transfers from the medicare hi and smi trust funds were not extended .

the section extends the termination date of pctorf through fy2029 ; extends the termination dates of the fees on health insurance policies and self - insured plans through fy2029 ; and extends the requirement that 20% of pcortf funds be transferred to the hhs secretary for carrying out phsa section 937 for each fiscal year through fy2029 .

the section also makes modifications to the authorizing language for pcori relating to the composition of its board ; appointments to its methodology committee ; and the identification of research priorities , among others .

current status appropriated funds to pcortf expire after september 30 , 2029 .

funds transferred to the hhs secretary under irc section 9511 remain available until expended .

no amounts shall be available for expenditure from the pcortf after september 30 , 2029 , and any amounts in the trust fund after such date shall be transferred to the general fund of the treasury .
