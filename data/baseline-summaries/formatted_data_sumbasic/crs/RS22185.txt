most federal and state programs of financial assistance to poor and low - income families either increase income or subsidize the purchase of goods and services to help them meet their basic , immediate consumption needs .

the exceptions are education and training programs , that seek to build "human capital. .

more recently , individual development accounts ( idas ) have been developed to help low - income families build financial capital .

ida programs are operated by community - based organizations ( including faith - based organizations ) , as well as state and local governments in partnership with community - based organizations .

from the participant's viewpoint , idas operate much like retirement 401 ( k ) plans: the participant makes contributions , which are matched ( at varying rates ) by the program .

withdrawals from idas are restricted .

funds can be withdrawn to finance specific activities and purchases â€” generally , education , the purchase of a home , and to start a business .

an individual's contributions may also be withdrawn for other purposes , but this leads to the loss of matching funds .

in addition to providing matching funds for accounts , ida programs also provide financial literacy education , case management , and supportive services to participants .

this report describes ida programs funded by two major federal grants: the assets for independence ( afi ) act of 1998 and the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) program created in the 1996 welfare reform law .

other federal initiatives that provide for more targeted idas ( eg , for refugees and for families in assisted housing ) are not discussed in this report .

the assets for independence act ( afi , p.l .

105-285 ) authorized up to $25 million per year for fy1999 to 2003 for competitively awarded ida demonstration programs .

congress has continued the afi program absent an authorization .

the department of health and human service ( hhs ) administers the afi program .

table 1 provides a funding history for idas under the afi program .

afi is funded at $19 million for fy2014 .

afi grantees must raise nonfederal funds to operate afi idas .

the afi federal grant to an individual grantee cannot exceed the lesser of ( 1 ) the amount of nonfederal resources raised for the program , or ( 2 ) $1 million .

temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) is a federal block grant that gives states broad flexibility in the use of its funds in aiding needy families with children .

generally , tanf funds ( and required state monies spent under its "maintenance of effort" requirement ) can be used to further any of its statutory goals .

in addition , tanf provides specific authority and rules for states to operate ida programs .

states may use tanf and state maintenance of effort funds for idas either as an activity that furthers the statute's broad goals , in which case it must conform only to general tanf rules , or under tanf's specific authority to use funds for idas , in which case it must follow tanf's specific ida rules .
