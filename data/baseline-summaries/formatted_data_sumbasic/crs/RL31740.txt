cubanofficials maintained that the u.s. decision was irresponsible and that it was prepared to discuss allof the issues raised by the united states .

 ( see migration issues below ) .

although cuba has undertaken some limited economic reforms in recent years , politicallythe country remains a hard - line communist state .

fidel castro , who turned 78 on august 13 , 2004,has ruled since the 1959 cuban revolution , which ousted the corrupt government of fulgenciobatista from power .

castro soon laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime by consolidatingpower and forcing moderates out of the government .

in april 1961 , castro admitted that the cubanrevolution was socialist , and in december 1961 , he proclaimed himself to be a marxist - leninist .

from 1959 until 1976 , castro ruled by decree .

a constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the communist party as the leading forcein the state and in society ( with power centered in a politburo headed by fidel castro ) .

theconstitution also outlined national , provincial , and local governmental structures .

executive poweris vested in a council of ministers , headed by fidel castro as president .

legislative authority isvested in a national assembly of people's power , currently with 609 members , that meets twiceannually for brief periods .

while assembly members were directly elected for the first time infebruary 1993 , only a single slate of candidates was offered .

in october 1997 , the cubancommunist party held its 5th congress ( the prior one was held in 1991 ) in which the party reaffirmedits commitment to a single party state and reelected fidel and raul castro as the party's first andsecond secretaries .

direct elections for the national assembly were again held in january 1998 andjanuary 2003 , but voters again were not offered a choice of candidates .

in response to the challenge posed by the varela project , a human rights initiative that calledfor changes to the constitution ( see below ) , the cuban government orchestrated a nationalreferendum in late june 2002 , signed by 8.1 million people , that declared that cuba's socialist systemcould not be changed .

subsequently the national assembly on june 26 , 2002 , approved amendmentsto the constitution stating that "socialism and the revolutionary political and social system in theconstitution.....are irrevocable ; and cuba will never again return to capitalism. .

with the cutoff of assistance from the former soviet union , cuba experienced severeeconomic deterioration from 1989-1993 , although there has been improvement since 1994 .

estimates of economic decline in the 1989-93 period range from 35-50% .

from 1994-2000,however , economic growth averaged 3.7% annually , with a low of 0.4% in 1994 and a high of 7.8%in 1996 .

growth rates since 2001 have slowed , averaging almost 2.4% ( 3% in 2001 , 1.5% in 2002,and an estimated 2.6% in 2003 ) , although the forecast for 2004 is for 3.5% .

 ( 11 ) growth in 2001 and 2002slowed in the aftermath of the effects of hurricane michelle and the september 11 , 2001 terroristattacks in the united states .

the terrorist attacks severely affected cuba's tourist industry , withreports of some hotels closing and restaurants being empty .

hurricane michelle damaged some45,000 homes and severely hurt the agricultural sector .

low world prices for sugar and nickel andvenezuela's april - september 2002 suspension of oil shipments to cuba because of cuba's slowpayment also contributed to the economic slowdown .

 ( 12 ) economic growth in 2004 could be affected by a drought ineastern cuba , the worst in 40 years , that has severely damaged agricultural crops , as well as byhurricanes charley and ivan that caused significant damage and flooding in western cuba .

socialist cuba has expressed pride for the nation's accomplishments in health and education .

the world bank estimates that in 2000 , the adult literacy rate was 97% , life expectancy was 76years , and the under - 5 years of age mortality rate was 9 per 1,000 , the lowest rate in latin americaand comparable to the rate of the united states .

nevertheless , the country's economic decline hasreduced living standards considerably and resulted in shortages in medicines and medical supplies .

when cuba's economic slide began in 1989 , the government showed little willingness toadopt any significant market - oriented economic reforms , but in 1993 , faced with unprecedentedeconomic decline , cuba began to change policy direction .

since 1993 , cubans have been allowedto own and use u.s. dollars and to shop at dollar - only shops previously limited to tourists anddiplomats .

self - employment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993 , most in theservice sector , and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations .

other cubaneconomic reforms included breaking up large state farms into smaller , more autonomous , agriculturalcooperatives ( basic units of cooperative production , ubpcs ) in 1993 ; opening agricultural marketsin september 1994 where farmers could sell part of their produce on the open market ; openingartisan markets in october 1994 for the sale of handicrafts ; allowing private food catering , includinghome restaurants ( paladares ) in june 1995 ( in effect legalizing activities that were already takingplace ) ; approving a new foreign investment law in september 1995 that allows fully ownedinvestments by foreigners in all sectors of the economy with the exception of defense , health , andeducation ; and authorizing the establishment of free trade zones with tariff reductions typical of suchzones in june 1996 .

in may 1997 , the government enacted legislation to reform the banking systemand established a new central bank ( bcc ) to operate as an autonomous and independent entity .

despite these measures , the quality of life for many cubans remains difficult - - characterizedby low wages , high prices for many basic goods , shortages of medicines , and power outages - - andsome analysts fear that the government has begun to backtrack on its reform efforts .

regulationsand new taxes have made it extremely difficult for many of the nation's self - employed .

some homerestaurants have been forced to close because of the regulations .

some foreign investors in cubahave also begun to complain that the government has backed out of deals or forced them out ofbusiness .

in april 2004 , the cuban government limited the use of dollars by state companies forany services or products not considered part of their core business ; some analysts viewed themeasure as an effort to turn back the clock on economic reform measures .

 ( 13 ) on october 25 , 2004 , fidel castro announced that u.s. dollars no longer would be used inentities that currently accept dollars ( such as stores , restaurants , and hotels ) .

instead , cubans wouldneed to exchange their dollars for "convertible pesos," with a 10% surcharge for the exchange .

cubans could exchange their dollars or deposit them in banks with the surcharge until november14 .

dollar bank accounts will still be allowed , but cubans will not be able to deposit new dollarsinto the accounts .

in the early 1960s , u.s. - cuban relations deteriorated sharply when fidel castro began tobuild a repressive communist dictatorship and moved his country toward close relations with thesoviet union .

the often tense and hostile nature of the u.s. - cuban relationship is illustrated by suchevents and actions as: u.s. covert operations to overthrow the castro government culminating in theill - fated april 1961 bay of pigs invasion ; the october 1962 missile crisis in which the united statesconfronted the soviet union over its attempt to place offensive nuclear missiles in cuba ; cubansupport for guerrilla insurgencies and military support for revolutionary governments in africa andthe western hemisphere ; the 1980 exodus of around 125,000 cubans to the united states in theso - called mariel boatlift ; the 1994 exodus of more than 30,000 cubans who were interdicted andhoused at u.s. facilities in guantanamo and panama ; and the february 1996 shootdown by cubanfighter jets of two u.s. civilian planes , resulting in the death of four u.s. crew members .

since the early 1960s , u.s. policy toward cuba has consisted largely of isolating the islandnation through comprehensive economic sanctions .

these sanctions were made stronger with thecuban democracy act ( cda ) of 1992 ( p.l.102-484 , title xvii ) and with the cuban liberty anddemocratic solidarity act of 1996 ( p.l .

104-114 ) , often referred to as the helms / burton legislation .

the cda prohibits u.s. subsidiaries from engaging in trade with cuba and prohibits entry into theunited states for any vessel to load or unload freight if it has engaged in trade with cuba within thelast 180 days .

the helms / burton legislation - - enacted in the aftermath of cuba's shooting down oftwo u.s. civilian planes in february 1996 - - combines a variety of measures to increase pressure oncuba and provides for a plan to assist cuba once it begins the transition to democracy .

among thelaw's sanctions is a provision in title iii that holds any person or government that traffics in u.s.property confiscated by the cuban government liable for monetary damages in u.s. federal court .

acting under provisions of the law , however , both president clinton and president bush havesuspended the implementation of title iii at six - month intervals .

another component of u.s. policy consists of support measures for the cuban people , aso - called second track of u.s. policy .

this includes u.s. private humanitarian donations , medicalexports to cuba under the terms of the cuban democracy act of 1992 , u.s. government support fordemocracy - building efforts , and u.s. - sponsored radio and television broadcasting to cuba .

inaddition , the 106th congress approved the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of2000 ( p.l .

106-387 , title ix ) that allows for agricultural exports to cuba , albeit with restrictions onfinancing such exports .

the clinton administration made several changes to u.s. policy in the aftermath of thepope's january 1998 visit to cuba , which were intended to bolster u.s. support for the cuban people.these included the resumption of direct flights to cuba ( which had been curtailed after the february1996 shootdown of two u.s. civilian planes ) , the resumption of cash remittances for the support ofclose relatives in cuba ( which had been curtailed in august 1994 in response to the migration crisiswith cuba ) , and the streamlining of procedures for the commercial sale of medicines and medicalsupplies and equipment to cuba .

in january 1999 , president clinton announced several additionalmeasures to support the cuban people .

these included a broadening of cash remittances to cuba,so that all u.s. residents ( not just those with close relatives in cuba ) could send remittances to cuba ; an expansion of direct passenger charter flights to cuba from additional u.s. cities other than miami ( direct flights later in the year began from los angeles and new york ) ; and an expansion ofpeople - to - people contact by loosening restrictions on travel to cuba for certain categories oftravelers , such as professional researchers and those involved in a wide range of educational,religious , and sports competition .
