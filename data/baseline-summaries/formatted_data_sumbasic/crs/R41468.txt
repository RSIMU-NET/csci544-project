the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) has often been described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 .

it provides broad nondiscrimination protection in employment , public services , public accommodations , and services operated by private entities , transportation , and telecommunications for individuals with disabilities .

as stated in the act , its purpose is "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. .

the ada and its regulations require reasonable accommodation or modifications in policies , practices , or procedures when such modifications are necessary to render the goods , services , facilities , privileges , advantages , or accommodations accessible to individuals with disabilities .

this concept is found in title i , regarding employment , title ii , regarding public entities , and title iii , regarding public accommodations .

the reasonable accommodation or modification requirement has been interpreted to allow the use of service animals , even in places where animals are generally not permitted .

recently , the department of justice ( doj ) promulgated regulations containing specific details about service animals , including when they may be denied access , and defining service animals as trained dogs .

this report focuses on these regulatory requirements .

generally , a public entity ( title ii ) or a place of public accommodation ( title iii ) must modify its policies , practices , and procedures to allow an individual with a disability to use a service animal .

more specifically , individuals with disabilities must be permitted to be accompanied by their service animal in areas where other members of the public , or participants in programs or activities are allowed .

a public entity or place of public accommodation may not ask or require a surcharge for a service animal , even if people with pets must pay an additional fee .

however , there are certain limitations on these requirements , and , as noted previously , these limitations also apply to miniature horses .

the animal must be under its handler's control and the public entity or place of public accommodation is not responsible for the care or supervision of the animal .

the regulations specifically allow a public entity or a place of public accommodation to ask an individual with a disability to remove a service animal from the premises when the animal is out of control and its handler does not take effective action to control it , or the animal is not housebroken .

in its discussion of these exceptions , doj observes that an animal may misbehave when provoked or injured .

if there is reason to suspect this has occurred , a public entity or a place of public accommodation should determine the facts and , if provocation or injury has occurred , take steps to prevent any similar actions .

when the service animal is properly excluded , the public entity or a place of public accommodation must give the individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in the service , program , or activity without the animal .

a public entity or place of public accommodation may not ask about the nature or extent of an individual's disability but may ask two questions to determine if the animal is a service animal , when it is not readily apparent .

these two questions are if the animal is required because of a disability , and what work or task the animal is trained to do .

although the doj title ii and iii regulations provide significant guidance regarding service animals , there are still some issues remaining .

for example , the exact interaction between the ada's requirements and those of other statutes , such as the fair housing act , is somewhat uncertain .

when a facility has a mixed use — such as a hotel which allows both residential and short - term stays but does not allocate space for these different uses in separate , discrete units — both the ada and the fair housing act may apply to the facility .

exactly how the differing service animal requirements would apply in this situation is unclear and will most likely await judicial determinations .

similarly , doj regulations do not address the issues involved when an individual with allergies to dogs and an individual with a disability using a service animal both attempt to use a place of public accommodation .

this situation , which may occur more often given the more expansive definition of disability provided in ada amendments act , was at issue in lockett v. catalina channel express , inc .

in lockett , catalina channel express ( cce ) , which operates a ferry between long beach and catalina island , instituted a policy of excluding animals from part of the ferry because of a request by a frequent passenger for an area free of animal dander .

when an individual with a visual impairment and a guide dog attempted to buy a ticket for this part of the ferry , the cce refused , although it changed its policy two weeks later .

the court of appeals found that the cce had made a "one - time reasonable judgment … while it investigated the competing interests" and emphasized the narrowness of its holding .

thus , there is considerable ambiguity concerning how potentially conflicting claims for accommodations relating to service animals should be addressed .
