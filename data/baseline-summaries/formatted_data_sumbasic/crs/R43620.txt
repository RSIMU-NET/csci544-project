a central american nation with a population of about 3.8 million , panama has made notable political and economic progress since the december 1989 u.s. military intervention that ousted the military regime of general manuel antonio noriega from power .

the intervention was the culmination of two and a half years of strong u.s. pressure against the de facto political rule of noriega , commander of the panama defense forces .

since that time , the country has had five successive elected civilian governments , and a sixth is scheduled to assume power on july 1 , 2014 with the inauguration of current vice president juan carlos varela as president .

current president ricardo martinelli , elected in 2009 , remained generally popular during his presidency despite criticism at various junctures for his combative style of governing .

panama's largely services - based economy has been booming in recent years , spurred on by the panama canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is expected to be completed in early 2016 .

the endurance of elected civilian democracy in panama for almost 25 years is a significant departure from the country's previous 21-year history of military rule .

this included the populist rule of general omar torrijos ( 1968-1981 ) , who initially governed as a social reformer , and the increasingly repressive rule of general noriega ( 1983-1989 ) .

in the aftermath of the ouster of the noriega regime , the duly elected winner of the 1989 presidential election , guillermo endara ( 1989-1994 ) , took office ; his coalition government made significant progress in restoring functioning democratic political institutions , although the demilitarization process was difficult at times .

the center - left government of president ernesto pérez balladares ( 1994-1999 ) of the former pro - noriega democratic revolutionary party ( prd ) implemented an economic reform program that included trade liberalization and privatization of state - owned enterprises .

pérez balladares sought to amend the constitution to allow for presidential reelection , but panamanians rejected the proposal by a large margin in a national referendum .

the center - right arnulfista party government of president mireya moscoso ( 1999-2004 ) , panama's first female president , partially reversed the trade liberalization efforts of her predecessor .

the center - left prd government of president martín torrijos ( 2004-2009 ) , the son of the former military ruler , initiated the panama canal expansion project , negotiated a free trade agreement with the united states , and enacted judicial , penal , and anti - corruption reforms .

current president ricardo martinelli , a businessman and former government minister from the small center - right democratic change ( cd ) party , defeated the prd candidate by a landslide in the may 2009 presidential election .

his electoral alliance , known as the alliance for change , also won a majority of seats in the national assembly .

until september 2011 , president martinelli governed in a coalition with the center - right panameñista party ( ppa , previously known as the arnulfista party ) , but the coalition fell apart in august 2011 after a rupture in relations between martinelli and vice president juan carlos varela of the ppa .

varela was sacked as foreign minister , but continued in his elected position as vice president , albeit as a strong critic of president martinelli .

in the last year of his term , president martinelli remained broadly popular in large part because of the strong performance of the panamanian economy under his government buoyed by the ongoing canal expansion and other large infrastructure projects ( see " economic situation " below ) .

yet over the course of his tenure , martinelli's public approval ratings had dropped several times after strong public opposition and protests over some of his policy proposals related to labor issues , mining , and the sale of land in the colón free zone ( the world's second largest duty free zone after hong kong ) .

he was also criticized by civil society groups and political opponents for taking a heavy - handed approach toward governing and for not being more consultative .

u.s. relations with panama date to the country's independence from colombia in 1903 .

while historically there were strains in relations at various times over the operation of the panama canal , the panama canal treaties negotiated in 1977 reduced tensions in the relationship and set a path for panama's assumption of full jurisdiction over the canal by the end of the century .

relations deteriorated significantly in the 1987-1989 period under the de facto political rule of general manuel noriega .

since the december 1989 u.s military intervention , however , and panama's return to elected civilian democratic rule , u.s. relations with panama have been close .

bilateral relations were strengthened with the approval of a bilateral free trade agreement that entered into force in october 2012 .

according to the state department , the country's central location in the hemisphere , the panama canal , its transportation infrastructure , and its financial sector make it an important hub for global trade and a key u.s. strategic partner , but these same characteristics make panama vulnerable to drug trafficking , money laundering , and organized criminal activity .

upon juan carlos varela's election in may 2014 , secretary of state john kerry commented that "our longstanding cooperation and commitment to panama and the panamanian people will endure with the next administration. .

in terms of foreign policy , panama has been a strong u.s. ally in the region .

while many other latin american countries had a timid response to the venezuelan government's suppression of protests beginning in february 2014 , panama spoke out and called for a special meeting of the oas and even made a venezuelan opposition legislator a temporary member of its oas delegation .

in july 2013 , panama detained a north korean freighter , which had made stops in cuba , as it prepared to enter the panama canal due to suspicion that the ship was carrying illicit narcotics ; instead , the ship was found to be carrying military weapons .

the u.n. security council's panel of experts for north korea visited panama and concluded in a report issued by the security council in march 2014 that the military shipment destined for north korea constituted a violation of u.n. sanctions violation .

during a trip to panama in november 2013 , vice president biden lauded panama for stepping up and taking on that international responsibility and contribution to global security .

looking ahead , panama is scheduled to host the next seventh summit of the americas in 2015 .

at issue is a possible invitation to cuba to participate in the summit ; panama's minister of foreign affairs reportedly has suggested extending an invitation to cuba .

several latin american nations have vowed not to attend the summit unless cuba is allowed to participate .

the united states and canada opposed cuba's attendance at the 2012 summit because it was not a democracy , and ultimately cuba was not invited .

panama's political and economic outlook appears promising .

the country is now approaching 25 years of elected civilian democratic rule , and its services - based economy remains strong .

the panama canal expansion project , other infrastructure projects , and the country's large financial sector position panama to continue to play a significant role in international and regional trade .

the government's challenges include efforts to combat poverty and inequality and to continue to make headway in combating threats from drug trafficking , money laundering , and organized crime .

u.s. relations with panama under the incoming government of juan carlos varela are expected to continue to be strong , with extensive cooperation on drug trafficking and other security issues and robust trade and investment linkages .

panama is scheduled to host the seventh summit of the americas in 2015 .

several latin american nations have vowed not to attend unless cuba is invited to participate .
