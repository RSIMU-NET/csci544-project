potential oversight questions for congress include the following: how much consideration is the navy giving in the cg ( x ) aoa to design options other than those based on the ddg - 1000 ? .

are other basic options being treated in the aoa simply as straw men ? .

what are the relative costs and capabilities of the options discussed above ? .

what is the potential tradeoff between unit capability ( and unit procurement cost ) on the one hand , and potential numbers procured on the other ? .

in assessing basic cg ( x ) design options , is the navy assigning too much value , not enough value , or about the right amount of value to the sunk costs of designing the ddg - 1000 hull and to cg ( x ) production economies that can result from the ddg - 1000 learning curve ? .

section 1012 of the house - reported version of the fy2008 defense authorization bill ( h.r .

1585 ) would make it u.s. policy to build cruisers and certain other large navy ships with nuclear power unless the secretary of defense notifies congress that nuclear power for a given class of ship would not be in the national interest .

the provision is discussed on page 387 of the house armed services committee's report on h.r .

1585 ( h.rept .

110-146 of may 11 , 2007 ) .
