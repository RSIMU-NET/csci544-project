between fy1998 and fy2007 , the annual budget of the department of defense ( dod ) science and technology ( s&t ) program grew from $7.7 billion to $12.8 billion .

in constant fy2009 dollars , the cumulative increase was $22.5 billion .

the purpose of this report is to aid congressional oversight of dod's s&t program by analyzing this budget increase by department and agency , by budget activity , and by program element .

specifically , the report examines whether the budget increase benefitted all programs or focused on certain priority areas .

in a period of higher budget deficits , as sustaining current levels of military spending becomes more of a fiscal challenge , and as the nation continues to position itself to engage effectively in a changing strategic environment , policymakers may scrutinize the allocation of s&t resources more closely .

this report focuses on the growth in the base s&t budgets between fy1998 and fy2007 .

this period of time is interesting to policymakers for several reasons .

it includes the transition in fy2000 to a period of significant and historic growth in the s&t budget .

it includes a change in administration , as well as the historic strategic transition from the post - cold war era to the war - on - terror era .

picking fy1998 as the baseline year is somewhat arbitrary , but because s&t funding for the three years prior to fy1998 was relatively stable , it would appear to represent a valid starting point .

also , declines in overall defense spending , beginning in fy1986 , bottomed out in fy1998 , representing the end of the post - cold war draw - down .

the period of analysis ends in fy2007 , the latest budget year for which "actual" s&t funding data exist ( see below ) .

the increase in s&t funding over the 10 years from fy1998 to fy2007 was distributed broadly across the s&t program .

each department ( army , navy , and air force ) and the defense agencies as a whole shared roughly equally in dollar terms .

in percentage terms , the defense agencies' increase , taken as a whole , was noticeably less .

although the total increase in s&t funding , in dollar terms , was distributed between departments in roughly equal shares , the increases were distributed variably across their budget activities .

applied research ( budget activity 6.3 ) of each of the departments increased the most and by roughly the same amount when taken as a percentage .

across all of dod , basic research increased the least in dollar terms , although in percentage terms this varied considerably between departments and agencies .

of the pes that were in existence throughout the 10-year period , 73% exceeded their baseline funding .

the increases varied from pe to pe , but the pes that increased the most represented a relatively small share of the total increase .

it is difficult to discern any clear "winners" over these 10 years in terms of particular mission , disciplines , or sub - systems .

a possible exception may be a growing emphasis on countering weapons of mass destruction .

this could reflect a shift away from traditional force - on - force conflict toward a more unconventional post - cold war threat .

congress has three basic approaches to consider when funding s&t going forward â€” continue increasing s&t funding , reduce s&t funding , or keep s&t funding flat in inflation - adjusted dollars .

within each option , congress may also decide to adjust the allocation of resources or keep it more or less the same .

for example , the director of defense engineering and research has advocated more basic research .

in an expanding program , congress may be able to accommodate an increase in basic research ( or elsewhere within the s&t program ) without having to make other major allocation adjustments .

however , in a flat or declining budget , growth in a particular department , agency , program , or budget activity would have to be accompanied by decreases somewhere else .

any such decrease could come from those programs that experienced the greatest increases over the last ten years , arguing that the past growth has been sufficient to meet perceived needs .

if , however , these areas of past growth are deemed to require yet more growth , decreases would have to come from elsewhere within the program .

in this situation , the relatively few programs that have already experienced decreases could be further reduced , indicating their lower priority .

however , any such further reductions could render the program inefficient in trying to meet its goals .

alternatively , decreases could be spread evenly over all other programs , reducing the impact on any particular program areas .
