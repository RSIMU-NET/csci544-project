status of district of columbia appropriations: fy200 .

the creation of a needle exchange program funded with federal or district funds is one of the key policy issues debated during house consideration of the district'sappropriations bills for fy2000 .

the controversy surrounding creation of a needleexchange program touched on issues of home rule , public health policy , andgovernment sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs .

proponents of aneedle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hivamong illegal drug users by reducing the incidents of shared needles .

opponents ofsuch efforts contend that such programs amount to government sanctioning of illegaldrugs by supplying drug addicted persons with the tools to use them .

they content that public health concerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through sharedcontaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitationprograms .

another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and thecity's ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressionalactions .

the conference committee versions of h.r .

2587 and h.r .

3064 , which was vetoed by the president on november 3 , 1999,would have prohibited the use of federal and district funds to finance a needleexchange program .

the senate during consideration of its version of h.r .

2587 , the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 , didnot include a provision prohibiting the creation of such a program .

the housedistrict of columbia appropriations subcommittee also did not include funding forsuch a program in the bill forwarded to the full appropriations committee .

for itspart the house appropriations committee reported a bill , h.r .

2587 ,that included a provision prohibiting the use of federal funds for a needle exchangeprogram .

the bill passed by the house on july 29 , 1999 , would have left intactlanguage contained the district's appropriations act for fy1999 , prohibiting the useof federal or local funds for a needle exchange program .

the conference committee version of h.r .

3064 continued the prohibition against the public funding of a needle exchange program .

congressagreed on a compromise that would have allowed the private funding of a needleexchange program , but would continue to prohibit the use of federal and districtfunds for such a program .

presently , only one entity , prevention works , a privatenon - profit aids awareness and education program , operates a privately fundedneedle exchange program .

the house version of h.r .

3194 included a provision that would prohibit any organization that receives federal or district funds from funding a needleexchange program with private funds .

this was a reversal of language contained in h.r .

3064 , which prohibited organizations from using public funds forneedle exchange activities , but did not prevent or prohibit an organization thatreceives public funds from operating a privately funded needle exchange program .

p.l .

106-113 and the senate version of h.r .

3194 included the languageof h.r .

3064 , allowing organizations to continue to receive public fundsfor other activities while using private funds to finance needle exchange programs .

the medical marijuana initiative provision in the district of columbia appropriations bills is yet another issue that engenders controversy .

last yearcongress included a provision that prohibited the city from counting ballots of aninitiative that would allow the medical use of marijuana to assist persons sufferingdebilitating health conditions and diseases including cancer and hiv infection .

thedistrict of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 , p.l .

106-113 , and h.r .

3064 , as vetoed by the president , prohibit the implementation ofthe medical marijuana initiative known as initiative 59 .

a house appropriations committee version of h.r .

2587 , the first version of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 , included aprovision that would have prohibited the use of federal funds to tally the results ofthe ballot initiative , but would have allowed the city to use local funds to determinethe outcome of the initiative .

the district of columbia board of elections estimatedthe cost of tallying the results as approximately $1.36 .

the house provision of h.r .

2587 , was later changed to include a prohibition on the use federaland district funds to implement any law legalizing the use of marijuana , even formedical purposes .

the conference committee version of h.r .

2587 ,which was vetoed by the president , would have allowed the tallying of the votes castfor and against the medical use of marijuana , but would have kept in place allpenalties for the use , distribution , or possession of schedule 1 control substances,which would include marijuana .

opponents of the conference committee provisioncontent that such actions undercuts the concept of home rule .

the provision'sproponents argue that the provision allows the people's voice to be heard , but keepsin place federal sanctions .

last year , the congress' power prohibiting the counting of a medical marijuana ballot initiative was challenged in a suit filed by the d.c. chapter of the americancivil liberties union ( aclu ) .

on september 17 , 1999 , district court judgerichard roberts ruled that congress , despite its unique legislative responsibility forthe district under article i , sec .

8 of the constitution , did not possess the power tostifle or prevent political speech , which included the ballot initiative .

judge robertsruling allowed the city to tally the votes on the november 1998 ballot initiative .

toprevent the implementation of the initiative , congress had 30 days to pass aresolution of disapproval from the date the medical marijuana ballot initiative ( initiative 59 ) is certified by the board of elections and ethics .

language prohibitingthe implementation of the initiative was included in p.l .

106-113 ; the conferenceversion of h.r .

3064 , which was vetoed by the president ; and in thehouse , senate , and conference versions of h.r .

3194 .

during house and senate hearings on the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 , district officials unsuccessfully sought the removal of a provisioncontained in the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 .

theprovision required the district to establish a $150 million reserve fund in futurebudgets starting in fy2000 .

the city contends that such a reserve fund is not needed given the city's surpluses of the last two years and project surpluses in the coming years .

p.l.106-113 , consistent with earlier house and senate appropriation bills for fy2000 , requires the city to maintain the reserve fund .

the house version of h.r .

2587 would have directed the city to use any general fund surplusabove $250 million to cover seasonal cash shortfalls in lieu of short - term borrowing,then to accelerate the repayment of funds borrowed from the water and sewer fund,and finally to repay down long - term debt .

the senate's original version of h.r .

2587 required the city to use any surplus above 4% of the generalfund balance for one - time expenses and debt reduction .

p.l .

106-113 and the vetoed h.r .

3064 adopted the senate language that was first included in h.r .

2587 .

p.l .

3064 and h.r .

the act alsoprovides assistance to eligible students seeking admissions to private institutions .

onnovember 1 , 1999 , congress completed action on the tuition assistance program ( h.r .

974 ) , the required enabling legislation that had to be signed by thepresident before the $17 million could be made available .

a college access bill wasintroduced in the senate , s. 856 .

on september 9 , 1999 , the senatecommittee on governmental affairs , amended h.r .

974 by substitutingthe language contained in s. 856 and reported the bill to the senateaccompanied by s.rept .

on november 1 , 1999 , the house recededto the senate amendment to h.r .

974 , and passed the measure by voicevote .

the president signed the bill into law , p.l .

106-98 , on november 12 , 1999 .

congress has become increasingly concerned about the management of the district's court system .

the house committee report ( h.rept .

106-249 ) accompanying the house version of h.r .

2587 , criticized the courtsmanagement , and accused court administrators of playing shell games with fundsappropriated for payment of lawyers representing abused children .

the house reportincluded language recommending that the proposed pay raise for court employees bedelayed .

the conference committee - approved version of h.r .

2587 , h.r .

3064 , h.r .

3194 included provisions calling for agao report on the operation of the district's justice system including the courts .

inaddition , the conference committee - approved bills included a provision that transfers$33.3 million in funds for lawyers representing abused and neglected children andindigent persons to a separate account .

the provision is intended to ensure that thecourt administrators do not misspend dedicated funds .

p.l .

106-113 includes thesame provisions .

in a related matter , on october 4 , 1999 , superior court administrator ulysses hammond announced his resignation effective february 18 , 2000 .

hammond hadbeen under increasing scrutiny and criticism over concerns surrounding themismanagement of court operations and budget shortfalls .

the public funding of abortion services for district of columbia residents is a perennial issue debated by congress during its annual deliberations on the districtof columbia appropriations .

p.l .

106-113 , includes a provision that prohibits the useof federal or district funds for abortion services except in cases where the life of themother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .

this prohibitionhas been in place since 1995 , when congress approved the district of columbia actfor fy1996 , p.l .

104-134 .

since 1979 , with the passage of the district of columbia appropriations act of 1980 , p.l .

96-93 , congress has placed some limitation or prohibition on the use ofpublic funds for abortion services for district residents .

from 1979 to 1988,congress restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services to cases where themother's life would be endangered or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest .

the district was free to use district funds for abortion services .

when congress passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1989 , p.l .

100-462 , it restricted the use of district and federal funds for abortionservices to cases where the mother's life would be endangered if the pregnancy wastaken to term .

the inclusion of district funds , and the elimination of rape or incestas qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services , was pushed for bypresident reagan , who threatened to veto the district's appropriations act if theabortion provision was not modified .

in 1989 , president bush twice vetoed thedistrict's fy1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue .

he signed p.l.101-168 .

after insisting that congress include language prohibiting the use of districtrevenues to pay for abortion services except in cases where the mother's life wasendangered .

the district successfully fought for the removal of the provision limiting district funding of abortion services , when congress considered and passed thedistrict of columbia appropriations act for fy1994 , p.l .

103-127 .

the fy1994 actalso reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances allowing for the publicfunding of abortion services .

the district's success was short lived .

the district ofcolumbia appropriations act for fy1996 , p.l .

104-134 , and subsequent district ofcolumbia appropriations acts , limited the use of district and federal funds forabortion services to cases where the mother's life is endangered or cases where thepregnancy was the result of rape or incest .

district officials , when urging president clinton to veto the fy2000 appropriations act , h.r .

2587 , cited the prohibition on the use ofdistrict funds as just another example of congressional intrusion into local matters .

district officials had hoped that clinton's veto would lead to the removal ormodification of the abortion provision and other social provisions they feel intrudeon home rule .

the abortion prohibition was unchanged during conferenceconsideration of h.r .

3064 .

the prohibition also is included in p.l .

106-113 .
