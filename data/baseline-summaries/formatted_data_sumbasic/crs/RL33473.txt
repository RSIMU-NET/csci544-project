two recent events heightened congressional concern about the state of judicial security: the murders of the husband and mother of united states district judge joan lefkow by a disgruntled litigant and the murders of judge rowland barton , his court reporter , a deputy sheriff , and a federal officer in atlanta , georgia .

the 109 th congress responded by introducing a number of bills .

some pieces of legislation addressed issues of courthouse security and physical security for judges and court personnel , whereas other legislation went beyond courthouse security and physical security for judges and court personnel and addressed issues concerning the integrity of the judicial system in the united states .

legislation has been introduced in the 110 th congress that addresses many of the same issues that were addressed by legislation in the 109 th congress .

this report discusses the state of judicial security in the united states , as well as legislation introduced in the 110 th congress that would enhance judicial security .

this report also provides a brief overview of legislation introduced in 109 th congress that would have addressed judicial security .

this report , however , does not discuss the agencies involved in providing security for the federal judiciary .

similar legislation was introduced in the 110 th congress .
