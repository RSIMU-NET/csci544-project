appendix a .

past ssn force - level goals this appendix summarizes attack submarine force - level goals since the reagan administration ( 1981-1989 ) .

the reagan - era plan for a 600-ship navy included an objective of achieving and maintaining a force of 100 ssns .

the george h. w. bush administration's proposed base force plan of 1991-1992 originally called for a navy of more than 400 ships , including 80 ssns .

in 1992 , however , the ssn goal was reduced to about 55 boats as a result of a 1992 joint staff force - level requirement study ( updated in 1993 ) that called for a force of 51 to 67 ssns , including 10 to 12 with seawolf - level acoustic quieting , by the year 2012 .

the clinton administration , as part of its 1993 bottom - up review ( bur ) of u.s. defense policy , established a goal of maintaining a navy of about 346 ships , including 45 to 55 ssns .

the clinton administration's 1997 qdr supported a requirement for a navy of about 305 ships and established a tentative ssn force - level goal of 50 boats , "contingent on a reevaluation of peacetime operational requirements. .

the clinton administration later amended the ssn figure to 55 boats ( and therefore a total of about 310 ships ) .

the reevaluation called for in the 1997 qdr was carried out as part of a joint chiefs of staff ( jcs ) study on future requirements for ssns that was completed in december 1999 .

the study had three main conclusions: "that a force structure below 55 ssns in the 2015 [time frame] and 62 [ssns] in the 2025 time frame would leave the cinc's [the regional military commanders - in - chief] with insufficient capability to respond to urgent crucial demands without gapping other requirements of higher national interest .

additionally , this force structure [55 ssns in 2015 and 62 in 2025] would be sufficient to meet the modeled war fighting requirements" ; "that to counter the technologically pacing threat would require 18 virginia class ssns in the 2015 time frame" ; and "that 68 ssns in the 2015 [time frame] and 76 [ssns] in the 2025 time frame would meet all of the cincs' and national intelligence community's highest operational and collection requirements. .

the conclusions of the 1999 jcs study were mentioned in discussions of required ssn force levels , but the figures of 68 and 76 submarines were not translated into official dod force - level goals .

the george w. bush administration's report on the 2001 qdr revalidated the amended requirement from the 1997 qdr for a fleet of about 310 ships , including 55 ssns .

in revalidating this and other u.s. military force - structure goals , the report cautioned that as dod's "transformation effort matures — and as it produces significantly higher output of military value from each element of the force — dod will explore additional opportunities to restructure and reorganize the armed forces. .

dod and the navy conducted studies on undersea warfare requirements in 2003-2004 .

one of the navy studies — an internal navy study done in 2004 — reportedly recommended reducing the attack submarine force level requirement to as few as 37 boats .

the study reportedly recommended homeporting a total of nine attack submarines at guam and using satellites and unmanned underwater vehicles ( uuvs ) to perform isr missions now performed by attack submarines .

in march 2005 , the navy submitted to congress a report projecting navy force levels out to fy2035 .

the report presented two alternatives for fy2035 — a 260-ship fleet including 37 ssns and 4 ssgns , and a 325-ship fleet including 41 ssns and 4 ssgns .

in may 2005 , it was reported that a newly completed dod study on attack submarine requirements called for maintaining a force of 45 to 50 boats .

in february 2006 , the navy proposed to maintain in coming years a fleet of 313 ships , including 48 ssns .

although the navy's ship force - level goals have changed repeatedly in subsequent years , the figure of 48 ssns remained unchanged until december 2016 , when the navy released a force - level objective for achieving and maintaining a force of 355 ships , including 66 ssns .

appendix b .

options for funding ssns this appendix presents information on some alternative profiles for funding the procurement of ssns .

these alternatives include but are not necessarily limited to the following: two years of advance procurement ( ap ) funding followed by full funding — the traditional approach , under which there are two years of ap funding for the ssn's long - leadtime components , followed by the remainder of the boat's procurement funding in the year of procurement ; one year of ap funding followed by full funding — one year of ap funding for the ssn's long - leadtime components , followed by the remainder of the boat's procurement funding in the year of procurement ; full funding with no ap funding ( single - year full funding , aka point - blank full funding ) — full funding of the ssn in the year of procurement , with no ap funding in prior years ; incremental funding — partial funding of the ssn in the year of procurement , followed by one or more years of additional funding increments needed to complete the procurement cost of the ship ; and advance appropriations — a form of full funding that can be viewed as a legislatively locked in form of incremental funding .

navy testimony to congress in early 2007 , when congress was considering the fy2008 budget , suggested that two years of ap funding are required to fund the procurement of an ssn , and consequently that additional ssns could not be procured until fy2010 at the earliest .

this testimony understated congress's options regarding the procurement of additional ssns in the near term .

although ssns are normally procured with two years of ap funding ( which is used primarily for financing long - leadtime nuclear propulsion components ) , congress can procure an ssn without prior - year ap funding , or with only one year of ap funding .

consequently , congress at that time had the option of procuring an additional ssn in fy2009 and / or fy2010 .

single - year full funding has been used in the past by congress to procure nuclear - powered ships for which no prior - year ap funding had been provided .

specifically , congress used single - year full funding in fy1980 to procure the nuclear - powered aircraft carrier cvn - 71 , and again in fy1988 to procure the cvns 74 and 75 .

in the case of the fy1988 procurement , under the administration's proposed fy1988 budget , cvns 74 and 75 were to be procured in fy1990 and fy1993 , respectively , and the fy1988 budget was to make the initial ap payment for cvn - 74 .

congress , in acting on the fy1988 budget , decided to accelerate the procurement of both ships to fy1988 , and fully funded the two ships that year at a combined cost of $6.325 billion .

the ships entered service in 1995 and 1998 , respectively .

the existence in both fy1980 and fy1988 of a spare set of nimitz - class reactor components was not what made it possible for congress to fund cvns 71 , 74 , and 75 with single - year full funding ; it simply permitted the ships to be built more quickly .

what made it possible for congress to fund the carriers with single - year full funding was congress's constitutional authority to appropriate funding for that purpose .

procuring an ssn with one year of ap funding or no ap funding would not materially change the way the ssn would be built — the process would still encompass two or three years of advance work on long - leadtime components , and an additional five or six years or so of construction work on the ship itself .

the outlay rate for the ssn could be slower , as outlays for construction of the ship itself would begin one or two years later than normal , and the interval between the recorded year of full funding and the year that the ship enters service would be longer than normal .

congress in the past has procured certain ships in the knowledge that those ships would not begin construction for some time and consequently would take longer to enter service than a ship of that kind would normally require .

when congress procured two nuclear - powered aircraft carriers ( cvns 72 and 73 ) in fy1983 , and another two ( cvns 74 and 75 ) in fy1988 , it did so in both cases in the knowledge that the second ship in each case would not begin construction until some time after the first .

appendix c. 2006 navy study on options for mitigating projected valley in ssn force level this appendix presents background information on a study initiated by the navy in 2006 for mitigating the valley in the ssn force levels projected for the 2020s and 2030s .

the study was completed in early 2007 and briefed to crs and cbo on may 22 , 2007 .

at the time of the study , the ssn force was projected to bottom out at 40 boats and then recover to 48 boats by the early 2030s .

principal points in the navy study ( which cite ssn force - level projections as understood at that time ) include the following: the day - to - day requirement for deployed ssns is 10.0 , meaning that , on average , a total of 10 ssns are to be deployed on a day - to - day basis .

the peak projected wartime demand is about 35 ssns deployed within a certain amount of time .

this figure includes both the 10.0 ssns that are to be deployed on a day - to - day basis and 25 additional ssns surged from the united states within a certain amount of time .

reducing virginia - class shipyard construction time to 60 months — something that the navy already plans to do as part of its strategy for meeting the virginia - class cost - reduction goal ( see earlier discussion on cost - reduction goal ) — will increase the size of the ssn force by two boats , so that the force would bottom out at 42 boats rather than 40 .

if , in addition to reducing virginia - class shipyard construction time to 60 months , the navy also lengthens the service lives of 16 existing ssns by periods ranging from 3 months to 24 months ( with many falling in the range of 9 to 15 months ) , this would increase the size of the ssn force by another two boats , so that the force would bottom out at 44 boats rather than 40 boats .

the total cost of extending the lives of the 16 boats would be roughly $500 million in constant fy2005 dollars .

the resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could meet the 10.0 requirement for day - to - day deployed ssns throughout the 2020-2033 period if , as an additional option , about 40 ssn deployments occurring in the eight - year period 2025-2032 were lengthened from six months to seven months .

these 40 or so lengthened deployments would represent about one - quarter of all the ssn deployments that would take place during the eight - year period .

the resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could not meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within a certain amount of time .

the force could generate a total deployment of 32 ssns within the time in question — 3 boats ( or about 8.6% ) less than the 35-boat figure .

lengthening ssn deployments from six months to seven months would not improve the force's ability to meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within a certain amount of time .

to meet the 35-boat figure , an additional four ssns beyond those planned by the navy would need to be procured .

procuring four additional ssns would permit the resulting 48-boat force to surge an additional three ssns within the time in question , so that the force could meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within a certain amount of time .

procuring one to four additional ssns could also reduce the number of seven - month deployments that would be required to meet the 10.0 requirement for day - to - day deployed ssns during the period 2025-2032 .

procuring one additional ssn would reduce the number of seven - month deployments during this period to about 29 ; procuring two additional ssns would reduce it to about 17 , procuring three additional ssns would reduce it to about 7 , and procuring four additional ssns would reduce it to 2 .

the navy added a number of caveats to these results , including but not limited to the following: the requirement for 10.0 ssns deployed on a day - to - day basis is a current requirement that could change in the future .

the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within a certain amount of time is an internal navy figure that reflects recent analyses of potential future wartime requirements for ssns .

subsequent analyses of this issue could result in a different figure .

the identification of 19 ssns as candidates for service life extension reflects current evaluations of the material condition of these boats and projected use rates for their nuclear fuel cores .

if the material condition of these boats years from now turns out to be worse than the navy currently projects , some of them might no longer be suitable for service life extension .

in addition , if world conditions over the next several years require these submarines to use up their nuclear fuel cores more quickly than the navy now projects , then the amounts of time that their service lives might be extended could be reduced partially , to zero , or to less than zero ( i.e. , the service lives of the boats , rather than being extended , might need to be shortened ) .

the analysis does not take into account potential rare events , such as accidents , that might force the removal of an ssn from service before the end of its expected service life .

seven - month deployments might affect retention rates for submarine personnel .
