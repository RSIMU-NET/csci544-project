agriculture - based renewable energy can take several forms , including biofuels such as corn - based ethanol or soy - based biodiesel , wind - driven turbines located on farmland or in rural areas , anaerobic digesters that convert animal waste into methane and electric power , or biomass harvested for burning as a processing fuel or to generate heat as part of an industrial activity .

since the late 1970s , u.s. policymakers at both the federal and state levels have adopted a variety of incentives , regulations , and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculture - based renewable energy ( mostly biofuels ) .

in particular , the two most widely used biofuels — ethanol produced primarily from corn starch and biodiesel produced primarily from soybean oil — have received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives , loans and grants , and regulatory programs .

by early 2008 , just prior to the 2008 farm bill ( the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ; p.l .

110-246 ) , total direct federal biofuels subsidies were estimated at nearly $5.5 billion per year .

by 2010 , federal biofuels subsidies surpassed $7 billion .

motivations cited for these legislative initiatives included energy security concerns , reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , and raising domestic demand for u.s. - produced farm products .

this report focuses both on those policies contained in the 2008 farm bill — and as extended by §701 of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( atra ; p.l .

112-240 ) — that support agriculture - based renewable energy , especially biofuels , and on the outlook for bioenergy programs in the next farm bill .

the introductory sections of this report briefly describe how usda bioenergy policies evolved and how they fit into the larger context of u.s. biofuels policy .

then , each of the bioenergy provisions of the 2008 farm bill are defined in terms of their function , goals , administration , funding , and implementation status .

finally , a section reviews the outlook for bioenergy programs in the next farm bill , as well as the major emerging issues related to u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) energy programs .

two tables at the end of this report present data on 2008 farm bill energy provision funding — the budgetary authority ( table 1 ) , and the funding authority with the actual funding available for fy2008 through fy2012 ( table 2 ) .

a third table ( table 3 ) presents proposed bioenergy program funding for fy2014-fy2018 under farm bill legislation of the 113 th congress — the senate - passed s. 954 and the house - passed h.r .

2642 .

renewable energy production plays a key role not just in agricultural policy , but also in energy , tax , and environmental policy .

as a result , many of the federal programs that support renewable energy production in general , and agriculture - based energy production in particular , are outside the purview of usda and have origins outside of omnibus farm bill legislation .

for example , the three principal federal biofuels policies of the past decade were all established outside of farm bills as follows .

the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) mandates an increasing volume of biofuels use and has its origins in the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .

109-58 ) .

the rfs was expanded in the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa ; p.l .

110-140 ) and divided into four distinct , but nested categories — biodiesel , cellulosic , advanced , and total — each with its own mandated volume .

the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit ( veetc ) , originally established in the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l .

108-357 ) , provided a tax credit that varied in value over the years , but was last at $0.45 per gallon of pure ethanol blended with gasoline when it expired on december 31 , 2011 .

the ethanol import tariff ( a most - favored - nation duty of $0.54 per gallon ) was intended to offset the blending tax credit and was originally established by the omnibus reconciliation act of 1980 ( p.l .

96-499 ) .

the ethanol import tariff also expired on december 31 , 2011 .

in addition to the rfs , veetc , and import tariff , several other tax credits that originated outside of farm bills were available for biodiesel production as well as for small producers ( less than 60 million gallons per year per plant ) of ethanol and biodiesel .

a substantial number of federal programs also support renewable energy sources other than biofuels .

in addition to federal programs , many states offer additional support to biofuels producers , blenders , and consumers .

an awareness of the non - usda federal programs is important for appreciating the role envisioned for the energy title of the 2008 farm bill , which is designed to provide incentives for the research and development of new agriculture - based renewable fuels , especially second - generation biofuels ( based on non - food crop biomass such as cellulose and algae ) , and to expand their distribution and use .

like the 2002 farm bill , the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .

110-246 ) contained a distinct energy title ( title ix ) that significantly expanded the number and type of programs available to support biofuels production and use — including corn starch - based ethanol , cellulosic ethanol , and biodiesel .

the enacted 2008 farm bill's title ix served as a substitute amendment to the 2002 farm bill title ix and consisted of three sections .

the first section , 9001 , contained 13 new provisions that effectively replaced the provisions of the 2002 bill .

sections 9002 and 9003 directed studies and reports on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer , respectively .

research provisions relating to renewable energy were in title vii and tax and trade provisions were in title xv .

in addition , title vi ( rural development ) included several programs to facilitate rural renewable energy production and development .

relevant changes to any bioenergy provisions of the 2008 farm bill made under atra ( p.l .

112-240 ) are included .

the 112 th congress spent substantial time and effort during 2012 reviewing existing farm programs , consulting with stakeholders , and preparing new legislation to serve as the next five - year version of omnibus farm legislation — the anticipated 2012 farm bill .

the senate passed its version of the 2012 farm bill — the agriculture reform , food , and jobs act of 2012 ( arfja ; s. 3240 ) — on june 21 , 2012 .

the house agriculture committee approved its version — the federal agricultural reform and risk management act of 2012 ( farrm ; h.r .

6083 ) — on july 11 , 2012 .

however , house leadership did not bring h.r .

6083 to the floor for further action .

as a result , the 112 th congress failed to pass a new five - year farm bill .

instead , atra extends the current 2008 farm bill until september 30 , 2013 , or , in the case of the farm commodity programs that are on a different calendar , through crop year 2013 .

in the 113 th congress , both the senate - passed ( s. 954 ) and house - passed ( h.r .

2642 ) bills would extend most of the renewable energy provisions of title ix , with the exception of the rural energy self - sufficiency initiative , the forest biomass for energy program , the biofuels infrastructure study , and the renewable fertilizer study , which are either omitted or explicitly repealed by both bills .

in addition , s. 954 omits the repowering assistance program , while h.r .

2642 adds a new reporting requirement on energy use and efficiency at usda facilities .

funding for the next farm bill will be based on the baseline projection of the cost of the 2008 farm bill programs by the congressional budget office ( cbo ) during may 2013 , and on varying budgetary assumptions about whether programs will continue .

the primary difference between the house and senate bills is in the source of funding ( table 3 ) .

over their five - year reauthorization period ( fy2014-fy2018 ) , the senate bill contains a total of $900 million in new mandatory funding and authorizes $1.140 billion in appropriations for the various title ix programs .

in contrast , h.r .

2642 contains no mandatory funding for title ix programs , while authorizing $1.405 billion over the five years , subject to annual appropriations .

in addition , the house bill eliminates all support for the collection , harvest , storage , and transportation ( chst ) component of bcap , severely limiting its potential effectiveness as an incentive to produce cellulosic feedstocks .

available funding to write the next farm bill will be based on the baseline projections of the cost of current farm bill programs by the congressional budget office , and on varying budgetary assumptions about whether programs will continue .

all 13 bioenergy provisions of title ix — with the exception of section 9010 , the feedstock flexibility program for bioenergy producers — received mandatory funding only for the life of the 2008 farm bill , fy2008 through fy2012 .

although most of the title ix bioenergy programs have been reauthorized for fy2013 by the atra farm bill extension , they have received no new mandatory funding .

instead , most bioenergy programs were given extended authority to make appropriations of varying amounts which makes them dependent on the annual appropriations process .

as a result , usda bioenegy programs do not have a budgetary baseline beyond fy2012 .

many analysts believe that lack of mandatory funding under the 2008 farm bill extension represents a severe setback for long - term development of bioenergy programs .

see table 3 for a comparison of program funding under the house and senate 2013 farm bills .

although each of the various title ix programs has somewhat different policy goals , most of them end up funding very similar types of projects — anaerobic digesters , wind turbines , solar panels , and biofuels .

this is particularly true for the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels and reap funded projects , as well as doe - funded projects under the 1703 and 1705 loan guarantee programs .

also , research projects focused on renewable energy that are funded under reap and brdi , as well as certain eere - funded programs , appear to have some potential for overlap .

to actually measure the extent of overlap or similarity would require a project - by - project comparison .

in general , usda programs tend to focus on the primary energy source or feedstock , whereas doe projects tend to focus on the conversion or processing technology ; however , the difference often appears subtle to a lay person .

as a result , some policymakers suggest that some energy programs could be merged or eliminated to counter possible redundancy , whereas others ( particularly those whose district benefits from specific programs ) are quick to argue the merits of the individual programs .

the potential development of a cellulosic - based ethanol industry is presently impeded by the state of cellulosic conversion technology , which still is expensive relative to corn - based production and has been slow to move production from laboratory setting to commercial scale .

however , the enormous potential supply of low - cost cellulosic plant material available in the united states makes it an attractive prospective feedstock and helps to explain its considerable policy interest .

the 2008 farm bill energy title provided more than $1 billion in financial incentives and support to encourage the production and use of advanced ( mainly cellulosic ) biofuels .

grants and loan guarantees leveraged industry investments in new technologies and infrastructure , as well as in the production of cellulosic feedstocks .

however , the principal program designed to help "kick start" the u.s. cellulosic biofuels sector was the biomass crop assistance program ( bcap , §9001 ) .

bcap addressed the quintessential "chicken and egg" problem — how do you encourage producers to grow cellulosic biomass when there is no existing market for that biomass , and how do you encourage investors to build cellulosic biofuels plants when there is no known existing biomass feedstock supply ? .

bcap attempted to remove some of the risk for biomass growers by supporting the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks and by providing incentives for harvest and post - production storage and transport .

despite support from bcap and other federal programs , the cellulosic ethanol sector has been slow to develop .

currently , only small volumes of cellulosic ethanol are produced on a commercial scale .

only a few small refineries ( mostly pilot or demonstration in scope ) are engaged in limited production .

due to the slow progress in cellulosic ethanol production , epa has been compelled to substantially reduce the cellulosic biofuel rfs mandates set by congress for the years 2010 through 2013 — from 100 million gallons ( mgals ) in 2010 to a mandate of 6.5 mgals , from 250 mgals for 2011 to 6.6 mgals , from 500 mgals for 2012 to 10.45 mgals , and from 1 billion gallons for 2013 to a preliminary 14 million gallons .

the epa waiver of the cellulosic biofuels rfs for four consecutive years , coupled with recent limitations imposed on bcap funding ( see " section 9011: biomass crop assistance program ( bcap ) ," earlier in this report ) and the increasing congressional climate of budget austerity , likely increase the uncertainty associated with the future investments needed to kick start this sector .
