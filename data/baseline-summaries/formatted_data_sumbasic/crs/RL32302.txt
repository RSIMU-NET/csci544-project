302 ( a ) and 302 ( b ) allocation ceilings .

the maximum budget authority for annual dhsappropriations is determined through a two - stage congressional budget process .

inthe first stage , the congress agrees to overall spending totals in the annual concurrentresolution on the budget .

subsequently , these amounts are allocated among thevarious committees , usually through the statement of managers for the conferencereport on the budget resolution .

these amounts are known as the 302 ( a ) allocations .

they include the discretionary totals available to the house and senate committeeson appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations through the 13subcommittees responsible for the development of the appropriation bills specific toeach .

in the second stage of the process , the appropriations committees allocate the 302 ( a ) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the 13 annualappropriation bills .

these amounts are known as the 302 ( b ) allocations .

theseallocations must add up to no more than the 302 ( a ) discretionary allocation , and formthe basis for enforcing budget discipline , since any bill reported with total above theceiling is subject to a point of order .

302 ( b ) allocations may be adjusted during theyear as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment .

this report describes the president's proposal for fy2005 appropriations fordhs programs , as submitted to the congress on february 2 , 2004 , and thecongressional response to that proposal .

it compares the fy2005 amounts proposedin the president's budget , the current estimates of the fy2004 amounts for programsand activities that were transferred to dhs after its establishment on january 24,2003 .

this report tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to thefy2005 dhs appropriations bill , with particular attention paid to discretionaryprograms .

however , the report does not follow specific funding issues related tomandatory dhs programs - - such as retirement pay - - nor does it systematicallyfollow any legislation related to the authorization or amendment of dhs programs .

fy2005 represents the second annual appropriations cycle for dhs .

of the 13 annual appropriations bills , the dhs bill is estimated to be the fifth largest source ofdiscretionary funds , accounting for approximately 3.5% of the estimated $818.4billion total for all federal discretionary budget authority , as reported in the budgetof the united states government fiscal year 2005 , table s - 5 .

 ( 2 ) though not the focus of this paper , it is important to note that not all federal spending on homeland security is funneled through dhs .

according to a recentcongressional budget office ( cbo ) report , ( 3 ) theadministration has requested $47.3billion in fy2005 gross budget authority for federal homeland security activities .

ofthis total , according to cbo , $40 ( 4 ) billion or 86%is allocated to dhs .

however , itis also important to note that dhs performs many missions that are not related tohomeland security .

 ( 5 ) according to cbo,approximately $27.1 billion or 68% of thetotal fy2005 requested gross budget authority for dhs is devoted to homelandsecurity missions .

therefore , the requested dhs homeland security budget authorityfor fy2005 ( $27.1 billion ) represents approximately 57% of the total federalresources ( $47.3 billion ) sought by the administration for homeland securityactivities in fy2005 .
