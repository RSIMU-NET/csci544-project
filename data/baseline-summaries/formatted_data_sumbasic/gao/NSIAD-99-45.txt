concerned with the adequacy of the pace and scope of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to reduce the size and cost of its headquarters activities , you requested that we review the department's efforts to reduce its headquarters positions .

specifically , our report discusses the status of dod's efforts to reduce , as of the end of fiscal year 1998 ( 1 ) headquarters positions and associated costs in the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) and washington headquarters services , as required by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 and ( 2 ) headquarters positions across dod as required by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 .

in addition , our report discusses the reporting of personnel on temporary assignment to osd from other dod components .

you also requested that we review dod's revised directive on headquarters management activities .

as agreed with your office , we will report separately on this issue after the directive has been implemented .

believing dod's efforts to reduce its infrastructure , including the size of its headquarters activities , lagged behind cuts in operational forces , congress directed dod to reduce positions in osd , including washington headquarters services and other defense support activities , by 25 percent from fiscal year 1994 levels by the end of fiscal year 1999 .

furthermore , congress directed dod to reduce the number of positions in all dod headquarters activities by 25 percent from fiscal year 1997 levels by the end of fiscal year 2002 .

noting that it had already reduced personnel in heardquarters activities starting in fiscal year 1992 , dod believed these cuts would create an unreasonable burden on personnel who perform essential headquarters functions .

dod asked congress to repeal this provision in march 1998 .

however , congress did not rescind it .

dod noted that the congressionally mandated 25-percent reduction , when combined with the department's previously programmed reductions , would reduce these components by over 40 percent for the fiscal year 1992-2000 time period .

in october 1997 , we reported that the number of management headquarters' personnel and costs were significantly higher than reported by dod .

during fiscal years 1985-96 , dod reported steady decreases in its management headquarters and headquarters support personnel — a 31-percent decline from about 77,000 to 53,000 .

however , these data did not include personnel at most of dod's noncombat organizations that are subordinate to management headquarters .

in our review of selected subordinate organizations , nearly three of every four of them were primarily performing management or headquarters support functions and should have been reported to congress by dod .

we recommended that the secretary of defense revise the directive on management headquarters and headquarters support activities to expand its coverage and simplify its criteria .

in the november 1997 defense reform initiatives ( dri ) report , the secretary of defense directed osd to reduce the number of personnel .

to achieve reductions , the secretary directed that osd eliminate redundancy and obsolete functions , consolidate related functions , and transfer operational and program management functions to other dod organizations .

in addition , the secretary directed that osd's “hidden staff” — components that directly support osd but were not included as part of osd's formal organizational structure or reported in its personnel strengths — be absorbed into osd .

finally , the secretary directed the military departments and their major commands , defense agencies , defense field activities , joint staff , and unified commands to reduce the number of headquarters positions .

osd's administrative instruction 53 , “temporary staff augmentations,” states that temporary staff may be used for emergencies , for unforeseen temporary requirements or workload surges , or for jobs for which the skills are not otherwise available within the organization .

temporary staff are not to be used to perform continuing office functions .

dod plans to cut 1,373 positions in osd and its support activities by the end of fiscal year 1999 .

these reductions would be 2 percentage points more than the 25-percent cut mandated in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 .

although the number of positions has been reduced , civilian salary costs ( in constant dollars ) have not decreased .

in addition , some service and defense agency personnel assigned to osd are not counted as part of osd .

dod's plan to achieve the cuts is shown in table 1 .

appendix i shows the changes by office within osd .

as of the end of fiscal year 1998 , dod had cut 1,123 positions , or 82 percent of the planned reductions — 858 positions in osd and 265 positions in washington headquarters services ( see table 2 ) .

our analysis indicates that osd eliminated 402 positions primarily by abolishing vacant positions , reducing the number of overstrength positions , eliminating military positions after the incumbents rotated , and abolishing positions by using early - out incentives .

some positions were also eliminated through organizational changes .

for example , the office of the under secretary of defense for policy reorganized and eliminated one assistant secretary position as well as several support positions .

osd also reduced the size of its staff by transferring positions to other dod organizations .

for example , in fiscal year 1997 , osd transferred 278 positions from a defense support activity to a dod field activity .

positions in dod field activities are not counted as part of osd .

furthermore , dri directed that osd transfer positions that were considered operational or involved in program management to other dod organizations .

in fiscal year 1998 , osd transferred approximately 240 positions to other organizations .

the major transfers that occurred during fiscal year 1998 are the following: the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness transferred 48 positions for managing dod's tricare medical program to the tricare management activity , a dod field activity .

osd transferred 47 positions supporting various boards and commissions to the washington headquarters services .

the office of the under secretary of defense for policy transferred 42 positions at the u.s. mission to the north atlantic treaty organization to the department of the army .

the office of the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs transferred 28 positions that managed the freedom of information and security review programs to the washington headquarters services .

as of the end of fiscal year 1998 , dod had reduced washington headquarters services by a net of 265 positions .

approximately 300 positions were cut by contracting out the pentagon cleaning service , and another 130 were cut primarily by eliminating vacant positions and positions vacated through early - out incentives .

however , these cuts were partly offset by an increase of 165 positions from functions transferred into washington headquarters services , primarily from osd .

to complete the planned cuts , dod plans to cut 250 positions ( 202 in osd and 48 in washington headquarters services ) in fiscal year 1999 .

to achieve its cuts , osd plans to eliminate 130 positions and transfer another 72 positions .

as of november 1998 , osd had identified 32 of the positions to eliminate and told us it had completed 40 of the planned transfers .

washington headquarters services plans to cut 72 positions , which will be partly offset by an increase of 24 positions for new missions as well as the expansion of current missions .

as of october 1998 , washington headquarters services had cut 19 positions by transferring positions in the executive motor pool and travel function to the department of the army .

according to washington headquarters services officials , the remaining positions will be eliminated by consolidating contracting offices and through early - out incentives .

although about 1,125 positions were eliminated in or transferred from osd and washington headquarters services between fiscal year 1994 and 1998 , there was no proportional decrease in civilian salaries during this time frame .

our analysis indicates that osd civilian salary costs increased by $7 million ( 4 percent ) , from $172 million in fiscal year 1994 to $179 million in fiscal year 1998 ( constant 1998 dollars ) .

likewise , washington headquarters services civilian salary costs increased by $2 million ( 2 percent ) from $84 million to $86 million during this same period .

salary costs did not decline commensurate with the personnel reductions partly because many of the positions eliminated were vacant and annual civilian pay raises exceeded the inflation rate .

in addition , osd incurred some one - time costs associated with incentives to encourage personnel to leave early .

for example , dod paid $1.4 million in such incentives in fiscal year 1998 .

the military services and defense agencies temporarily assign personnel to osd that are not counted as part of osd .

while dri recommended that personnel in the defense support activities and overstrength positions be counted as part of osd , it did not discuss personnel temporarily assigned to osd .

dod does not have a central database that identifies such positions or people , known as detailees , but the number could be large .

for example , an official from the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications and intelligence ( asd / c3i ) said that 115 people were temporarily assigned to asd / c3i as of august 1998 .

the office of the under secretary of defense for policy said it had about 26 detailees , and the office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology said it had about 10 detailees .

our review of asd / c3i information on the 115 detailees' assignments showed that some of the detailees met the requirements of osd's administrative instruction on temporary staff .

for example , an asd / c3i official noted that his office could not recruit temporary staff with the required skills to deal with year 2000 issues .

asd / c3i was using 20 military service and defense agency people to work on such issues .

another 36 asd / c3i detailees were either liaisons with the various intelligence agencies or individuals from other agencies on developmental assignments .

according to an asd / c3i official , these positions are permanent within the organization , and personnel occupying these positions change every 2 to 3 years .

the remaining 59 positions being filled by detailees appeared to be a permanent part of asd / c3i .

according to an asd / c3i official , approximately 30 detailees had been assigned to work on specific projects but did not return to their home organizations when the projects ended .

for example , the defense information systems agency sent 17 people to asd / c3i to support the corporate information management initiative ; however , they did not return when the project was terminated .

asd / c3i officials said they were developing a plan to incorporate the policy - related positions into osd and return the other positions to their parent organizations by fiscal year 2000 .

the remainder of the detailees were in asd / c3i's defense airborne reconnaissance office .

according to an asd / c3i official , they plan to downsize the office from 27 to 18 and either transfer the function to one of the military departments or make it a permanent part of asd / c3i .

dod does not have a plan to reduce management headquarters and headquarters support personnel dod - wide by 25 percent by the end of fiscal year 2002 , as required by the national defense authorization act for 1998 .

the act requires dod to cut about 13,300 positions in its headquarters activities .

rather , dod has plans to reduce the number of headquarters positions by about 5,600 , or 11 percent , by the end of fiscal year 2002 ( see table 3 ) .

in november 1998 , the military services proposed establishing a task force to develop alternatives for reducing their headquarters structure .

as seen in table 3 , the military departments account for about 4,500 of the cuts planned to dod headquarters activities by the end of fiscal year 2002 .

 ( see apps .

ii , iii , and iv for a breakdown by military department. ) .

these cuts were directed primarily in the quadrennial defense review and dri .

for example , as part of the quadrennial defense review , the navy planned to reduce its atlantic and pacific fleet headquarters staff by approximately 1,260 , or 20 percent , and the marine corps planned to reduce its management headquarters by about 200 positions .

a navy official noted that some of the cuts planned in the fleet headquarters are being revised in the fiscal year 2000 budget .

on the other hand , the army and the air force had planned to reduce their headquarters by less than the 10 percent required by dri .

as a result , the air force had to cut about 1,150 and the army about 700 additional positions in headquarters to meet dri threshold .

both military departments allocated the additional cuts primarily on a fair - share percentage basis across their headquarters activities .

the joint staff plans to cut 135 positions and the unified commands about 260 positions by the end of fiscal year 2002 .

the joint staff plans to transfer about 75 military positions to the u.s. strategic command , return about 40 military positions to the military departments , and eliminate about 20 civilian positions .

finally , the reductions in the defense agencies are a combination of cuts directed in the quadrennial defense review and dri .

in november 1998 , the military departments proposed the establishment of a task force , chaired by the under secretary of the army , to develop alternatives for reducing dod's headquarters structure .

the task force would ( 1 ) identify processes and transactions , by functional area , that are significant drivers for the number of headquarters personnel ; ( 2 ) inventory the number of workyears associated annually with the transactions and processes , by functions ; and ( 3 ) assess the number of personnel that could be eliminated if transactions and processes were reengineered , automated , outsourced , or canceled .

each service will be allowed to reinvest any personnel and dollar savings from reducing headquarters activities .

the proposal calls for the task force to issue its report to congress in june 1999 .

we recommend that the secretary of defense determine the number and purpose of all personnel temporarily assigned to osd by other dod components .

detailees that do not meet osd's requirements of temporary staff should either be counted as osd personnel or returned to their parent organizations .

in comments on a draft of this report ( see app .

v ) , dod concurred with our recommendation and noted that it is developing a system to account for all personnel detailed to osd from other dod components .

as part of this process , dod plans to determine the validity and continued need for current detailees .

dod also noted that the report was technically accurate , but believed it needed to provide a more balanced treatment of the department's efforts to downsize its headquarters activities .

specifically , dod said the report does not include ( 1 ) the reason it requested relief from the 25-percent reduction required by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 and ( 2 ) the principal reason civilian pay costs did not come down between fiscal year 1994 and 1998 .

according to dod , it requested relief because headquarters activities have been reduced significantly since fiscal year 1992 .

we clarified the report to reflect dod's position and included information provided by dod on personnel reductions in management headquarters activities back to fiscal year 1992 .

regarding osd civilian pay costs , dod said the principal reason they did not decrease between fiscal year 1994 and 1998 was that nearly 200 civilians who worked for osd , but were attributed to the pay accounts of other dod elements , were transferred into the osd civilian pay account in fiscal year 1998 .

our analysis of changes in civilian pay accounted for these transfers .

still , key reasons civilian pay costs did not decline were that many of the positions eliminated were vacant , annual pay raises exceeded inflation costs , and the department incurred one - time costs associated with incentives to encourage people to leave early .

to obtain information on dod's plans to achieve the 25-percent reduction in osd and washington headquarters services positions , we interviewed officials in osd's office of the director , administration and management , and reviewed files that documented the cuts during fiscal years 1995-98 and planned for fiscal year 1999 .

in addition , we reviewed the defense reform initiative report .

we obtained civilian salary costs for osd , the defense support activities , and washington headquarters services for fiscal years 1994-98 from the washington headquarters services , directorate for budget and finance .

to determine how dod plans to achieve the 25-percent reduction in personnel at all its headquarters activities , we interviewed officials in the office of the under secretary of defense , comptroller , and manpower officials in each of the military departments and the joint staff .

in addition , we identified the position cuts to headquarters activities programmed between fiscal year 1997 and 2002 in the fiscal year 1999 future years defense program .

we conducted our work from june to december 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .

we are providing copies of this report to other appropriate congressional committees ; the secretaries of defense , the air force , the army , and the navy ; the chairman , joint chiefs of staff ; and the director , office of management and budget .

we also will provide copies to other interested parties on request .
