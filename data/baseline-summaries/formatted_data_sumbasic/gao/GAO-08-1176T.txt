i am pleased to be here today as you further examine concerns related to the adequacy of dental services for children in medicaid .

my testimony will provide a summary of our report for the subcommittee , which you are releasing today , entitled medicaid: extent of dental disease in children has not decreased , and millions are estimated to have untreated tooth decay .

this report provides information following the may 2007 and february 2008 subcommittee hearings investigating concerns related to the provision of dental services to children in medicaid .

these hearings investigated the circumstances of deamonte driver , a 12-year - old boy with medicaid coverage who did not receive timely and needed dental care and who died as a result of an untreated infected tooth that led to a fatal brain infection .

as you know , medicaid — the joint federal and state program that provides health care coverage for millions of low - income individuals — provides comprehensive dental coverage for enrolled children .

concerns raised at the hearings about low - income children's oral health , including the extent that children in medicaid experience dental disease and receive dental care , are not new .

gao reviews conducted in the late 1990s highlighted the problem of chronic dental disease and the factors that contribute to low use of dental care by low - income populations , including children in medicaid .

our new work examined two aspects of children's oral health: the extent to which children in medicaid experience dental disease and the extent to which they receive dental care .

we also assessed how these conditions have changed over time .

our work provides information from national health surveys on key indicators of the oral health status of children in medicaid , specifically , the rate of dental disease and their receipt of dental care , and changes in these indicators over time .

in carrying out this work , we analyzed data from a survey conducted by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) .

nhanes , which is administered by the centers for disease control and prevention's ( cdc ) national center for health statistics , obtains nationally representative information on the health and nutritional status of the u.s. population through direct physical examinations , including dental examinations , and interviews .

the dental examinations include a dentist's assessment of tooth decay and the presence of dental sealants , and the interviews include questions on various health and demographic characteristics , including information on insurance status .

to assess how the rate of dental disease experienced by children in medicaid has changed over time , we compared nhanes data from 1999 through 2004 with nhanes data from 1988 through 1994 .

we analyzed results from three different groups based on their health insurance status: children with medicaid , children with private health insurance , and uninsured children .

the group of children with private insurance included both children with dental coverage and children without dental coverage , while the group of uninsured was children who had neither health insurance nor dental insurance .

to assess how receipt of dental care has changed over time , we also analyzed data from another hhs survey , the medical expenditure panel survey ( meps ) .

meps is administered by hhs's agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) .

meps obtains nationally representative information on americans' health insurance coverage and use of health care , including information on receipt of dental care such as how often participants see a dentist and whether they have experienced problems accessing needed dental care .

our meps analysis was based on surveys conducted in 2004 and 2005 ( the most recent data available ) .

to assess changes in receipt of dental care over time , we compared the data from 2004 and 2005 with meps data from 1996 and 1997 .

we analyzed the meps data using the same three insurance groups as we used for the nhanes data .

to estimate the number of children in each medicaid category with a given condition , we applied certain proportions from nhanes or meps data to an estimate of the 2005 average monthly medicaid enrollment of children aged 2 through 18 ( 20.1 million children ) .

finally , we obtained information on oral health and the medicaid population from cdc and from dental associations and experts including the children's health dental project and the medicaid / schip dental association .

the work for our report was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards from december 2007 through september 2008 .

a detailed explanation of our methodology is included in the report .

in summary , dental disease and inadequate receipt of dental care remain significant problems for children in medicaid .

nationally representative survey data from 1999 through 2004 indicate that about one in three children aged 2 through 18 in medicaid had untreated tooth decay , and one in nine had untreated decay in three or more teeth .

projecting the survey results to the 2005 average monthly medicaid enrollment of 20.1 million children , we estimate that 6.5 million children aged 2 through 18 in medicaid had untreated tooth decay .

children in medicaid remain at higher risk of dental disease compared to children who have private health insurance ; children in medicaid were almost twice as likely to have untreated tooth decay .

survey data from 2004 and 2005 showed that only about one in three children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 had received dental care in the prior year ; about one in eight children reportedly never sees the dentist .

more than half of children with private health insurance , by contrast , had received dental care in the prior year .

children in medicaid also fared poorly when compared to national benchmarks , as the percentage of children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 who received any dental care — 37 percent — was far below hhs's healthy people 2010 target of having 66 percent of low - income children under age 19 receive a preventive dental service in the prior year .

survey data on medicaid children's receipt of dental care showed some improvement over time .

for example , comparison of survey data from 1988 through 1994 to more recent data from 1999 through 2004 showed that the percentage of children aged 6 through 18 in medicaid with at least one dental sealant increased nearly threefold , from 10 percent in 1988 through 1994 to 28 percent in 1999 through 2004 .

however , over the same time periods , dental disease in the overall medicaid population aged 2 through 18 did not decrease , although the data suggest the trends vary somewhat among different age groups .

younger children — those aged 2 through 5 — had statistically significant higher rates of dental disease in the more recent time period examined as compared to earlier surveys .

by contrast , data for adolescents — children in medicaid aged 16 through 18 — show declining rates of tooth decay , although the change was not statistically significant .

in commenting on a draft of our report , hhs provided comments from three component agencies: cms , cdc , and ahrq .

cms acknowledged the challenge of providing dental services to children in medicaid , as well as all children nationwide , and cited a number of activities undertaken by cms in coordination with states .

cdc commented that trends in dental caries ( tooth decay ) vary by age group and for primary versus permanent teeth .

we revised our report to further clarify the trends by age group and added information on cdc's findings in the general population .

ahrq commented that its own work on dental use , expenses , dental coverage , and changes had not been cited and sought additional clarification on the methodology used to analyze the data .

we revised our report to cite ahrq's findings on dental services for children and to further describe our methodology .

a full copy of hhs's written comments can be found in our report .

in 2000 , a report of the surgeon general noted that tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease .

left untreated , the pain and infections caused by tooth decay may lead to problems in eating , speaking , and learning .

tooth decay is almost completely preventable , and the pain , dysfunction , or on extremely rare occasion , death , resulting from dental disease can be avoided ( see fig .

1 ) .

preventive dental care can make a significant difference in health outcomes and has been shown to be cost - effective .

for example , a 2004 study found that average dental - related costs for low - income preschool children who had their first preventive dental visit by age 1 were less than one - half ( $262 compared to $546 ) of average costs for children who received their first preventive visit at age 4 through 5 .

the american academy of pediatric dentistry ( aapd ) recommends that each child see a dentist when his or her first tooth erupts and no later than the child's first birthday , with subsequent visits occurring at 6-month intervals or more frequently if recommended by a dentist .

the early initial visit can establish a “dental home” for the child , defined by aapd as the ongoing relationship with a dental provider who can ensure comprehensive and continuously accessible care .

comprehensive dental visits can include both clinical assessments , such as for tooth decay and sealants , and appropriate discussion and counseling for oral hygiene , injury prevention , and speech and language development , among other topics .

because resistance to tooth decay is determined in part by genetics , eating patterns , and oral hygiene , early prevention is important .

delaying the onset of tooth decay may also reduce long - term risk for more serious decay by delaying the exposure to caries risk factors to a time when the child can better control his or her health behaviors .

recognizing the importance of good oral health , hhs in 1990 and again in 2000 established oral health goals as part of its healthy people 2000 and 2010 initiatives .

these include objectives related to oral health in children , for example , reducing the proportion of children with untreated tooth decay .

one objective of healthy people 2010 relates to the medicaid population: to increase the proportion of low - income children and adolescents under the age of 19 who receive any preventive dental service in the past year , from 25 percent in 1996 to 66 percent in 2010 .

medicaid , a joint federal and state program that provides health care coverage for low - income individuals and families ; pregnant women ; and aged , blind , and disabled people , provided health coverage for an estimated 20.1 million children aged 2 through 18 in federal fiscal year 2005 .

the states operate their medicaid programs within broad federal requirements and may contract with managed - care organizations to provide medicaid benefits or use other forms of managed care , when approved by cms .

cms estimates that as of june 30 , 2006 , about 65 percent of medicaid beneficiaries received benefits through some form of managed care .

state medicaid programs must cover some services for certain populations under federal law .

for instance , under medicaid's early and periodic screening , diagnostic , and treatment ( epsdt ) benefit , states must provide dental screening , diagnostic , preventive , and related treatment services for all eligible medicaid beneficiaries under age 21 .

children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 often experience dental disease and often do not receive needed dental care , and although receipt of dental care has improved somewhat in recent years , the extent of dental disease for most age groups has not .

information from nhanes surveys from 1999 through 2004 showed that about one in three children ages 2 through 18 in medicaid had untreated tooth decay , and one in nine had untreated decay in three or more teeth .

compared to children with private health insurance , children in medicaid were substantially more likely to have untreated tooth decay and to be in urgent need of dental care .

meps surveys conducted in 2004 and 2005 found that almost two in three children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 had not received dental care in the previous year and that one in eight never sees a dentist .

children in medicaid were less likely to have received dental care than privately insured children , although they were more likely to have received care than children without health insurance .

children in medicaid also fared poorly when compared to national benchmarks , as the percentage of children in medicaid ages 2 through 18 who received any dental care — 37 percent — was far below the healthy people 2010 target of having 66 percent of low - income children under age 19 receive a preventive dental service .

meps data on medicaid children who had received dental care — from 1996 through 1997 compared to 2004 through 2005 — showed some improvement for children ages 2 through 18 in medicaid .

comparisons of recent nhanes data to data from the late 1980s and 1990s suggest that the extent that children ages 2 through 18 in medicaid experience dental disease has not decreased for most age groups .

dental disease is a common problem for children aged 2 through 18 enrolled in medicaid , according to national survey data ( see fig .

2 ) .

nhanes oral examinations conducted from 1999 through 2004 show that about three in five children ( 62 percent ) in medicaid had experienced tooth decay , and about one in three ( 33 percent ) were found to have untreated tooth decay .

close to one in nine — about 11 percent — had untreated decay in three or more teeth , which is a sign of unmet need for dental care and , according to some oral health experts , can suggest a severe oral health problem .

projecting these proportions to 2005 enrollment levels , we estimate that 6.5 million children in medicaid had untreated tooth decay , with 2.2 million children having untreated tooth decay involving three or more teeth .

compared with children with private health insurance , children in medicaid were at much higher risk of tooth decay and experienced problems at rates more similar to those without any insurance .

as shown in figure 3 , the proportion of children in medicaid with untreated tooth decay ( 33 percent ) was nearly double the rate for children who had private insurance ( 17 percent ) and was similar to the rate for uninsured children ( 35 percent ) .

these children were also more than twice as likely to have untreated tooth decay in three or more teeth than their privately insured counterparts ( 11 percent for medicaid children compared to 5 percent for children with private health insurance ) .

these disparities were consistent across all age groups we examined .

according to nhanes data , more than 5 percent of children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 had urgent dental conditions , that is , conditions in need of care within 2 weeks for the relief of symptoms and stabilization of the condition .

such conditions include tooth fractures , oral lesions , chronic pain , and other conditions that are unlikely to resolve without professional intervention .

on the basis of these data , we estimate that in 2005 , 1.1 million children aged 2 through 18 in medicaid had conditions that warranted seeing a dentist within 2 weeks .

compared to children who had private insurance , children in medicaid were more than four times as likely to be in urgent need of dental care .

the nhanes data suggest that the rates of untreated tooth decay for some medicaid beneficiaries could be about three times more than national health benchmarks .

for example , the nhanes data showed that 29 percent of children in medicaid aged 2 through 5 had untreated decay , which compares unfavorably with the healthy people 2010 target for untreated tooth decay of 9 percent of children aged 2 through 4 .

most children in medicaid do not visit the dentist regularly , according to 2004 and 2005 nationally representative meps data ( see fig .

4 ) .

according to these data , nearly two in three children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 had not received any dental care in the previous year .

projecting these proportions to 2005 enrollment levels , we estimate that 12.6 million children in medicaid have not seen a dentist in the previous year .

in reporting on trends in dental visits of the general population , ahrq reported in 2007 that about 31 percent of poor children ( family income less than or equal to the federal poverty level ) and 34 percent of low - income children ( family income above 100 percent but less than or equal to 200 percent of the federal poverty level ) had a dental visit during the year .

survey data also showed that about one in eight children ( 13 percent ) in medicaid reportedly never see a dentist .

meps survey data also show that many children in medicaid were unable to access needed dental care .

survey participants reported that about 4 percent of children aged 2 through 18 in medicaid were unable to get needed dental care in the previous year .

projecting this percentage to estimated 2005 enrollment levels , we estimate that 724,000 children aged 2 through 18 in medicaid could not obtain needed care .

regardless of insurance status , most participants who said a child could not get needed dental care said they were unable to afford such care .

however , 15 percent of children in medicaid who had difficulty accessing needed dental care reportedly were unable to get care because the provider refused to accept their insurance plan , compared to only 2 percent of privately insured children .

children enrolled in medicaid were less likely to have received dental care than privately insured children , but they were more likely to have received dental care than children without health insurance .

 ( see fig .

5. ) .

survey data from 2004 through 2005 showed that about 37 percent of children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 had visited the dentist in the previous year , compared with about 55 percent of children with private health insurance , and 26 percent of children without insurance .

the percentage of children in medicaid who received any dental care — 37 percent — was far below the healthy people 2010 target of having 66 percent of low - income children under age 19 receive a preventive dental service .

the nhanes data from 1999 through 2004 also provide some information related to the receipt of dental care .

the presence of dental sealants , a form of preventive care , is considered to be an indicator that a person has received dental care .

about 28 percent of children in medicaid had at least one dental sealant , according to 1999 through 2004 nhanes data .

in contrast , about 40 percent of children with private insurance had a sealant .

however , children in medicaid were more likely to have sealants than children without health insurance ( about 20 percent ) .

while comparisons of past and more recent survey data suggest that a larger proportion of children in medicaid had received dental care in recent surveys , the extent that children in medicaid experience dental disease has not decreased .

a comparison of nhanes results from 1988 through 1994 with results from 1999 through 2004 showed that the rates of untreated tooth decay were largely unchanged for children in medicaid aged 2 through 18: 31 percent of children had untreated tooth decay in 1988 through 1994 , compared with 33 percent in 1999 through 2004 ( see fig .

6 ) .

the proportion of children in medicaid who experienced tooth decay increased from 56 percent in the earlier period to 62 percent in more recent years .

this increase appears to be driven by younger children , as the 2 through 5 age group had substantially higher rates of dental disease in the more recent time period , 1999 through 2004 .

this preschool age group experienced a 32 percent rate of tooth decay in the 1988 through 1994 time period , compared to almost 40 percent experiencing tooth decay in 1999 through 2004 ( a statistically significant change ) .

data for adolescents , by contrast , suggest declining rates of tooth decay .

almost 82 percent of adolescents aged 16 through 18 in medicaid had experienced tooth decay in the earlier time period , compared to 75 percent in the latter time period ( although this change was not statistically significant ) .

these trends were similar for rates of untreated tooth decay , with the data suggesting rates going up for young children , and declining or remaining the same for older groups that are more likely to have permanent teeth .

according to cdc , these trends are similar for the general population of children , for which tooth decay in permanent teeth has generally declined and untreated tooth decay has remained unchanged .

cdc also found that tooth decay in preschool aged children in the general population had increased in primary teeth .

at the same time , indicators of receipt of dental care , including the proportion of children who had received dental care in the past year and use of sealants , have shown some improvement .

two indicators of receipt of dental care showed improvement from earlier surveys: the percentage of children in medicaid aged 2 through 18 who received dental care in the previous year increased from 31 percent in 1996 through 1997 to 37 percent in 2004 through 2005 , according to meps data ( see fig .

7 ) .

this change was statistically significant .

similarly , ahrq reported that the percent of children with a dental visit increased between 1996 and 2004 for both poor children ( 28 percent to 31 percent ) and low - income children ( 27 percent to 34 percent ) .

the percentage of children aged 6 through 18 in medicaid with at least one dental sealant increased nearly threefold , from 10 percent in 1988 through 1994 to 28 percent in 1999 through 2004 , according to nhanes data , and these changes were statistically significant .

the increase in receipt of sealants may be due in part to the increased use of dental sealants in recent years , as the percentage of uninsured and insured children with dental sealants doubled over the same time period .

adolescents aged 16 through 18 in medicaid had the greatest increase in receipt of sealants relative to other age groups .

the percentage of adolescents with dental sealants was about 6 percent in the earlier time period , and 33 percent more recently .

the percentage of children in medicaid who reportedly never see a dentist remained about the same between the two time periods , with about 14 percent in 1996 through 1997 who never saw a dentist , and 13 percent in 2004 through 2005 , according to meps data .

more information on our analysis of nhanes and meps for changes in dental disease and receipt of dental care for children in medicaid over time , including comments we received from hhs on a draft of the report and our response , more detailed data tables , and confidence intervals can be found in the report released today .

the information provided by nationally representative surveys regarding the oral health of our nation's low - income children in medicaid raises serious concerns .

measures of access to dental care for this population , such as children's dental visits , have improved somewhat in recent surveys , but remain far below national health goals .

of even greater concern are data that show that dental disease is prevalent among children in medicaid , and is not decreasing .

millions of children in medicaid are estimated to have dental disease in need of treatment ; in many cases this need is urgent .

given this unacceptable condition , it is important that those involved in providing dental care to children in medicaid — the federal government , states , providers , and others — address the need to improve the oral health condition of these children and to achieve national oral health goals .

as you know , we have ongoing work for the subcommittee examining state and federal efforts to ensure that children in medicaid receive needed dental services .

we expect to report to the subcommittee on our findings and any recommendations in spring 2009 .

mr. chairman , this concludes my prepared remarks .

i will be happy to answer any questions that you or other members of the subcommittee may have .
