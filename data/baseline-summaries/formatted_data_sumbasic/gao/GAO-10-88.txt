the accompanying auditor's report presents the results of our audits of the schedules of federal debt managed by the bureau of the public debt for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2009 and 2008 .

the schedules of federal debt present the beginning balances , increases and decreases , and ending balances for ( 1 ) federal debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt holdings , ( 2 ) the related accrued interest payables , and ( 3 ) the related net unamortized premiums and discounts managed by the bureau of the public debt ( bpd ) .

the auditor's report contains our ( 1 ) opinion on the schedules of federal debt for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , ( 2 ) opinion on the effectiveness of relevant internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 , 2009 , ( 3 ) conclusion on bpd's compliance in fiscal year 2009 with a selected provision of a law we tested , and ( 4 ) conclusion on the consistency between information in the schedules of federal debt and the accompanying overview on federal debt managed by the bureau of the public debt .

as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , federal debt managed by the bureau totaled about $11,898 billion and $10,011 billion , respectively , primarily for moneys borrowed to fund the federal government's operations .

as shown on the schedules of federal debt , these balances consisted of approximately ( 1 ) $7,552 billion as of september 30 , 2009 , and $5,809 billion as of september 30 , 2008 , of debt held by the public and about ( 2 ) $4,346 billion as of september 30 , 2009 , and $4,202 billion as of september 30 , 2008 , of intragovernmental debt holdings .

the level of debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the nation's wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues .

it represents the cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today's economy and the federal budget .

to finance a cash deficit , the federal government borrows from the public .

when a cash surplus occurs , the annual excess funds can then be used to reduce debt held by the public .

in other words , annual cash deficits or surpluses generally approximate the annual net change in the amount of federal government borrowing from the public .

intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of treasury securities held by federal government accounts , primarily federal trust funds ( eg , social security ) , that typically have an obligation to invest their excess annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities .

most federal trust funds invest in special u.s. treasury securities that are guaranteed for principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government .

the federal government uses the trust funds' invested cash surpluses to assist in funding other federal government operations .

the treasury securities held by the federal government accounts are not shown as balances on the federal government's consolidated financial statements because , under current u.s. generally accepted accounting principles , they represent loans from one part of the federal government to another .

when the federal government's financial statements are consolidated , those offsetting balances are eliminated .

these securities are nonmarketable ; however , they represent a priority call on future federal budgetary resources .

while both are important , debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt holdings are very different .

debt held by the public approximates the federal government's competition with other sectors in the credit markets .

federal borrowing absorbs resources available for private investment and may put upward pressure on interest rates .

in addition , interest on debt held by the public is paid in cash and represents a burden on current taxpayers .

it reflects the amount the federal government pays to its outside creditors .

in contrast , intragovernmental debt holdings typically do not require cash payments from the current budget or represent a burden on the current economy .

in addition , from the perspective of the budget as a whole , interest payments to federal government accounts by treasury are entirely offset by the income received by such accounts .

this intragovernmental debt and related interest represent a claim on future resources and hence a burden on future taxpayers and the future economy .

specifically , when trust funds redeem treasury securities to obtain cash to fund expenditures , treasury usually borrows from the public to finance these redemptions .

such borrowings result in competition for funds with the private sector and thus an effect on the economy .

we have audited the schedule of federal debt since fiscal year 1997 .

over this period , total federal debt has more than doubled , increasing by 120 percent .

during the last 4 fiscal years , managing the federal debt has continued to be a challenge as evidenced by the growth of total federal debt by $3,980 billion , or 50 percent , from $7,918 billion as of september 30 , 2005 , to $11,898 billion as of september 30 , 2009 .

the increase to the federal debt has become particularly acute since the onset of the recession in december 2007 .

federal government actions in response to both the financial market crisis and the economic downturn have added significantly to treasury's borrowing needs .

the fiscal year 2008 increase in total federal debt of $1,018 billion was the largest annual dollar increase in history ; only to be surpassed by the fiscal year 2009 increase of $1,887 billion .

of the fiscal year 2009 increase , about $1,743 billion was from the increase in debt held by the public and about $144 billion was from the increase in intragovernmental debt holdings .

two primary factors contributed to the increase in debt held by the public .

first , there was the largest reported deficit in history of $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009 , compared to $455 billion in fiscal year 2008 .

second , a significant amount of assets were purchased primarily relating to the government sponsored enterprise mortgage - backed securities purchase program and the troubled asset relief program in which debt was borrowed to fund the purchases .

treasury met its borrowing needs in part by reintroducing the 3-year and 7-year notes , both issued monthly , and increasing the amounts offered at public debt auctions .

further , treasury added offerings of both the 30-year bond and the 10-year note resulting in 12 additional auctions a year .

during fiscal years 2008 and 2009 , legislation was enacted to raise the statutory debt limit on three different occasions .

during this period , the statutory debt limit went from $9,815 billion to its current level of $12,104 billion , an increase of 23 percent .

legislation to increase the statutory debt limit to $13,029 billion was passed by the house of representatives and referred to the senate .

in addition , the secretary of the treasury has requested an increase in the statutory debt limit .

as of november 2 , 2009 , an increase had not been enacted .

weaknesses in the economy and financial markets — and the federal government's response to them — are expected to impact both the annual federal deficit and related debt in the near term .

official estimates for fiscal year 2010 show the annual federal deficit will exceed $1 trillion .

correspondingly , debt held by the public is expected to grow from an estimated 53.1 percent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) at the end of fiscal year 2009 to over 60 percent of gdp at the end of fiscal year 2010 .

however , while addressing these near - term pressures is important , the real challenge is not this year's deficit or even next year's ; it is how best to address the nation's long - term fiscal path over the coming decades .

while a lot of attention has been understandably given to the recent fiscal deterioration , the federal government faces even larger fiscal challenges that will persist long after the return to financial stability and economic growth .

the budget and economic implications of the baby boom generation's retirement have already become a factor in near - term budget projections and will only intensify as the baby boomers age .

the medicare hospital insurance program currently pays more in benefits than it receives in cash from payroll taxes .

the social security program , which has historically run large cash surpluses that helped reduce the need to borrow to finance other federal government activities , is expected to pay more in benefits than it receives in tax income for a sustained period beginning in 2016 .

gao and the congressional budget office's long - range fiscal policy simulations continue to show that , absent significant changes in policy , the federal government's fiscal condition over the coming decades is on an unsustainable path .

the sooner action is taken to address the long - term fiscal challenge , the less disruptive and destabilizing the changes will be .

as a result , once current economic and financial issues are addressed , the nation's leaders will need to turn their attention to the long - term challenges that lie ahead .

a continuing trend that we also have noted is the increase in reported foreign ownership of treasury securities .

treasury securities held by foreign and international investors have increased significantly since 2001 .

according to amounts reported in the september 2009 treasury bulletin , treasury estimates that the amount of treasury securities held by foreign and international investors has increased by $2,383 billion — from $1,001 billion as of june 30 , 2001 , to $3,384 billion as of june 30 , 2009 .

as of june 30 , 2009 , this represents an estimated 45 percent of debt held by the public , down from an estimated 50 percent as of june 30 , 2008 , but up from about 31 percent as of june 30 , 2001 .

to the commissioner of the bureau of the public debt in connection with fulfilling our requirement to audit the financial statements of the u.s. government , we have audited the schedules of federal debt managed by the bureau of the public debt ( bpd ) because of the significance of the federal debt to the federal government's financial statements .

this auditor's report presents the results of our audits of the schedules of federal debt managed by bpd for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2009 and 2008 .

the schedules of federal debt present the beginning balances , increases and decreases , and ending balances for ( 1 ) federal debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt holdings , ( 2 ) the related accrued interest payables , and ( 3 ) the related net unamortized premiums and discounts managed by bpd .

in our audits of the schedules of federal debt managed by bpd for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , we found the schedules of federal debt are presented fairly , in all material respects , in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ; bpd maintained , in all material respects , effective internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt as of september 30 , 2009 ; and no reportable noncompliance in fiscal year 2009 with a selected provision of law we tested .

the following sections discuss , in more detail , ( 1 ) these conclusions ; ( 2 ) our conclusion on the overview on federal debt managed by the bureau of the public debt ; ( 3 ) our audit objectives , scope , and methodology ; and ( 4 ) agency comments .

the schedules of federal debt including the accompanying notes present fairly , in all material respects , in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles , the balances as of september 30 , 2009 , 2008 , and 2007 for federal debt managed by bpd ; the related accrued interest payables and net unamortized premiums and discounts ; and the related increases and decreases for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2009 and 2008 .

bpd maintained , in all material respects , effective internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt as of september 30 , 2009 , that provided reasonable assurance that misstatements , losses , or noncompliance material in relation to the schedule of federal debt would be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis .

our opinion is based on criteria established under 31 u.s.c .

3512 ( c ) , ( d ) , commonly known as the federal managers' financial integrity act ( fmfia ) .

we identified deficiencies in bpd's system of internal control that we consider not to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies .

we have communicated these matters to management and , where appropriate , will report on them separately .

our tests of bpd's compliance with the statutory debt limit for fiscal year 2009 disclosed no instances of noncompliance that would be reportable under u.s. generally accepted government auditing standards .

the objective of our audit of the schedule of federal debt for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2009 , was not to provide an opinion on overall compliance with laws and regulations .

accordingly , we do not express such an opinion .

bpd's overview on federal debt managed by the bureau of the public debt contains information , some of which is not directly related to the schedules of federal debt .

we did not audit and we do not express an opinion on this information .

however , we compared this information for consistency with the schedules and discussed the methods of measurement and presentation with bpd officials .

on the basis of this limited work , we found no material inconsistencies with the schedules or u.s. generally accepted accounting principles .

bpd management is responsible for ( 1 ) preparing the schedules of federal debt in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ; ( 2 ) establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting , and evaluating its effectiveness ; and ( 3 ) complying with applicable laws and regulations .

bpd management evaluated the effectiveness of bpd's internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt as of september 30 , 2009 , based on the criteria established under fmfia .

bpd management's assertion is included in appendix i .

we are responsible for planning and performing the audit to obtain reasonable assurance and provide our opinion about whether ( 1 ) the schedules of federal debt are presented fairly , in all material respects , in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and ( 2 ) bpd management maintained , in all material respects , effective internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt as of september 30 , 2009 .

we are also responsible for ( 1 ) testing compliance with selected provisions of laws and regulations that have a direct and material effect on the schedule of federal debt and ( 2 ) performing limited procedures with respect to certain other information accompanying the schedules of federal debt .

in order to fulfill these responsibilities , we examined , on a test basis , evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the schedules of federal debt ; assessed the accounting principles used and any significant estimates evaluated the overall presentation of the schedules of federal debt ; obtained an understanding of the entity and its operations , including its internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt as of september 30 , 2009 ; considered bpd's process for evaluating and reporting on internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt based on the criteria established under fmfia ; assessed the risk that a material misstatement exists in the schedule of federal debt and the risk that a material weakness exists in internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt ; evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt as of september 30 , 2009 , based on the assessed risk ; tested relevant internal control over financial reporting ; tested compliance in fiscal year 2009 with the statutory debt limit ( 31 u.s.c .

internal control over financial reporting relevant to the schedule of federal debt is a process effected by those charged with governance , management , and other personnel , the objectives of which are to provide reasonable assurance that ( 1 ) transactions are properly recorded , processed , and summarized to permit the preparation of the schedule of federal debt in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ; and ( 2 ) transactions related to the schedule of federal debt are executed in accordance with laws governing the use of budget authority and other laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the schedule of federal debt .

we did not evaluate all internal controls relevant to operating objectives as broadly established under fmfia , such as those controls relevant to preparing statistical reports and ensuring efficient operations .

we limited our internal control testing to controls over financial reporting .

because of inherent limitations , internal control may not prevent or detect and correct misstatements due to error or fraud , losses , or noncompliance .

we also caution that projecting any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions , or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate .

we did not test compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to bpd .

we limited our tests of compliance to a selected provision of law that has a direct and material effect on the schedule of federal debt for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2009 .

we caution that noncompliance may occur and not be detected by these tests and that such testing may not be sufficient for other purposes .

we performed our audit in accordance with u.s. generally accepted government auditing standards .

we believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions and other conclusions .

in commenting on a draft of this report , bpd concurred with the conclusions in our report .

the comments are reprinted in appendix ii .

federal debt managed by the bureau of the public debt ( bpd ) comprises debt held by the public and debt held by certain federal government accounts ( under title 31 u.s.c .

§ 3101 ) , the latter of which is referred to as intragovernmental debt holdings .

as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , outstanding gross federal debt managed by the bureau totaled $11,898 and $10,011 billion , respectively .

the increase in gross federal debt of $1,887 billion during fiscal year 2009 was due to an increase in gross intragovernmental debt holdings of $144 billion and an increase in gross debt held by the public of $1,743 billion .

as figure 1 illustrates , both intragovernmental debt holdings and debt held by the public have increased since fiscal year 2005 .

the primary reason for the increases in intragovernmental debt holdings is the department of the treasury's use of the surpluses in the federal old - age and survivors insurance trust fund , civil service retirement and disability fund , federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund , military retirement fund , and dod medicare - eligible retiree health care fund .

the increases in debt held by the public are due primarily to total federal spending exceeding total federal revenues .

as of september 30 , 2009 , gross debt held by the public totaled $7,552 billion and gross intragovernmental debt holdings totaled $4,346 billion .

interest expense incurred during fiscal year 2009 consists of ( 1 ) interest accrued and paid on debt held by the public or credited to accounts holding intragovernmental debt during the fiscal year , ( 2 ) interest accrued during the fiscal year , but not yet paid on debt held by the public or credited to accounts holding intragovernmental debt , and ( 3 ) net amortization of premiums and discounts .

the primary components of interest expense are interest paid on the debt held by the public and interest credited to federal government trust funds and other federal government accounts that hold treasury securities .

the interest paid on the debt held by the public affects the current spending of the federal government and represents the burden in servicing its debt ( i.e. , payments to outside creditors ) .

interest credited to federal government trust funds and other federal government accounts , on the other hand , does not result in an immediate outlay of the federal government because one part of the government pays the interest and another part receives it .

however , this interest represents a claim on future budgetary resources and hence an obligation on future taxpayers .

this interest , when reinvested by the trust funds and other federal government accounts , is included in the programs' excess funds not currently needed in operations , which are invested in federal securities .

during fiscal year 2009 , interest expense incurred totaled $381 billion , interest expense on debt held by the public was $189 billion , and $192 billion was interest incurred for intragovernmental debt holdings .

as figure 2 illustrates , total interest expense has increased from fiscal years 2005 through 2008 , but decreased from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 .

due to the current economic conditions , there has been a significant increase in the demand for government backed securities , which resulted in lower average interest rates and interest expense .

for example , the average interest rates on treasury bills outstanding as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , were 0.3 percent and 1.6 percent , respectively .

average interest rates on principal balances outstanding as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , are disclosed in the notes to the schedules of federal debt .

debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the nation's wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior federal spending in excess of total federal revenues .

during the fiscal year , changes in economic conditions resulted in the need for an increase in borrowings from the public to finance federal spending .

treasury responded to the increase in marketable borrowing requirements by raising issuance sizes of regular weekly and monthly bills , increasing the frequency and issuance sizes of cash management bills , increasing the issuance sizes of nominal coupon security offerings , and adjusting the securities offering calendar to include the reintroduction of certain treasury notes .

as a result of this change in debt management strategy , treasury bill and treasury note issuances increased by $2,288 billion and $1,008 billion , respectively , in fiscal year 2009 .

due to the increase in short - term debt issuances , repayments increased by $2,317 billion during the fiscal year .

as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , gross debt held by the public totaled $7,552 billion and $5,809 billion , respectively ( see figure 1 ) , an increase of $1,743 billion .

as of september 30 , 2009 , $6,988 billion , or 93 percent , of the securities that constitute debt held by the public were marketable , meaning that once the federal government issues them , they can be resold by whoever owns them .

marketable debt is made up of treasury bills , treasury notes , treasury bonds , and treasury inflation - protected securities ( tips ) with maturity dates ranging from less than 1 year out to 30 years .

of the marketable securities currently held by the public as of september 30 , 2009 , $4,509 billion , or 65 percent , will mature within the next 4 years ( see figure 3 ) .

as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , notes and tips held by the public maturing within the next 10 years totaled $4,169 billion and $3,004 billion , respectively , an increase of $1,165 billion .

the callable security will mature in fiscal year 2015 , and is reported by its call date .

debt held by the public , cont .

the federal government also issues to the public nonmarketable securities , which cannot be resold , and have maturity dates from on demand out to 40 years .

as of september 30 , 2009 , nonmarketable securities totaled $564 billion , or 7 percent of debt held by the public .

as of that date , nonmarketable securities primarily consisted of savings securities totaling $192 billion , special securities for state and local governments totaling $216 billion , and government account series securities totaling $119 the federal reserve banks ( frbs ) act as fiscal agents for treasury , as permitted by the federal reserve act .

as fiscal agents for treasury , the frbs play a significant role in the processing of marketable book - entry securities and paper u.s. savings bonds .

for marketable book - entry securities , selected frbs receive bids ; issue book - entry securities to awarded bidders and collect payment on behalf of treasury ; and make interest and redemption payments from treasury's account to the accounts of security holders .

for paper u.s. savings bonds , selected frbs sell , print , and deliver savings bonds ; redeem savings bonds ; and handle the related transfers of cash .

callable securities mature between fiscal years 2012 and 2015 , but are reported by their call date .

intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of treasury securities held by over 230 individual federal government accounts with either the authority or the requirement to invest excess receipts in special u.s. treasury securities that are guaranteed for principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government .

intragovernmental debt holdings primarily consist of balances in the social security , medicare , military retirement and health care , and civil service retirement and disability trust funds .

as of september 30 , 2009 , such funds accounted for $3,986 billion , or 92 percent , of the $4,346 billion intragovernmental debt holdings balances ( see figure 4 ) .

as of september 30 , 2009 and 2008 , gross intragovernmental debt holdings totaled $4,346 billion and $4,202 billion , respectively ( see figure 1 ) , an increase of $144 the majority of intragovernmental debt holdings are government account series ( gas ) securities .

gas securities consist of par value securities and market - based securities , with terms ranging from on demand out to 30 years .

par value securities are issued and redeemed at par ( 100 percent of the face value ) , regardless of current market conditions .

market - based securities , however , can be issued at a premium or discount and are redeemed at par value on the maturity date or at market value if redeemed before the maturity date .

in an august 7 , 2009 , letter to senate majority leader harry reid , the secretary of the treasury requested that the statutory debt limit be raised .

an increase in the limitation is now awaiting senate approval .

as of september 30 , 2009 , the total public debt outstanding subject to the statutory debt limit was increase in system open market account holdings the amount of the federal reserve bank's system open market account ( soma ) holdings has increased significantly from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 .

specifically , total soma holdings were $769 billion as of september 30 , 2009 compared to $477 billion as of september 30 , 2008 .

this increase is due to the treasury portion of the large scale asset purchase program announced by the federal open market committee on march 18 , 2009 .

this portion of the program authorized the federal reserve to purchase up to $300 billion of u.s. treasury securities to help improve conditions in private credit markets .

decrease in the supplementary financing program the supplementary financing program ( sfp ) is a temporary program announced on september 17 , 2008 , by treasury and the federal reserve to provide emergency cash for federal reserve initiatives aimed at addressing the ongoing crisis in financial markets .

at the height of this program's activity , during the week of november 6 , 2008 , there were a total of 15 cash management bills outstanding that totaled $560 billion .

as of september 30 , 2009 , there were a total of 5 cash management bills outstanding that totaled $165 billion .

the decrease is a result of outstanding sfp bills that have matured and have not been reinvested in the program .

on september 16 , 2009 , treasury announced its intention to reduce the balance to $15 billion in the short run to preserve flexibility in the conduct of debt management policy .

overview , schedules , and notes significant events in fiscal year 2009 , cont .

equity decline in unemployment trust fund investments amounts invested in government account series securities by the unemployment trust fund have significantly declined during fiscal year 2009 .

this reduction is primarily attributable to elevated nationwide unemployment rates and the corresponding withdrawal of trust fund monies for payment of unemployment insurance benefits to eligible claimants .

additionally , the fund's investment holdings have been further reduced as a result of statutory changes enacted during the year .

in response to recent economic conditions , congress passed legislation authorizing the creation of new and modification of existing unemployment programs , including unemployment compensation modernization incentive payments , administrative grants to states , and extension of emergency unemployment compensation benefits .

in accordance with statutory language , much of the funding for the aforementioned programs was derived from amounts held within the unemployment trust fund .

reopening of the 10-year note and 30-year bond and the reintroduction of the 3-year in response to the large increase in projected financing needs , to better manage the overall debt portfolio , and to create additional flexibility in meeting uncertainty in borrowing requirements , treasury implemented changes to the auction calendar .

the changes included adding monthly 3-year notes and 7-year notes ; adding a reopening of 10-year notes ; and issuing 30-year bonds on a monthly basis .

during the fiscal year , treasury conducted over 290 auctions , resulting in the issuance of over $8 trillion dollars in marketable securities .

on november 5 , 2008 , treasury announced the reintroduction of the 3-year note as a result of the ongoing assessment of its debt management strategy .

the last issue date for a 3-year note was in may 2007 .

the first auction of the reintroduced 3-year notes occurred on november 10 , 2008 , with a settlement date on november 17 , 2008 .

on november 5 , 2008 , treasury announced it was moving to new - issue quarterly 30-year bond auctions beginning with the february 2009 quarterly refunding .

the first auction of the reopening of 30-year bonds occurred on march 12 , 2009 , with a settlement on march 16 , 2009 .

on april 29 , 2009 , treasury announced a second reopening of the 30-year bond .

the second reopening results in a monthly issuance of the 30-year bond .

the auction of the second reopening of the 30-year bond occurred on july 9 , 2009 , with a settlement on july 15 , 2009 .

on november 5 , 2008 , treasury announced the addition of a regular second reopening of the 10-year note in the month following the first reopening .

specifically , treasury auctioned a new - issue 10-year note on november 12 , 2008 during the refunding , reopened the security in december 2008 , and then reopened the security again in january 2009 .

the first auction of the second reopening of the 10-year note occurred on january 8 , 2009 , for settlement on january 15 , 2009 .

the issuance pattern of the 10-year note changed from twice a quarter to monthly .

on february 4 , 2009 , treasury announced the reintroduction of the 7-year note as a result of the ongoing assessment of its debt management strategy .

the last issue date for a 7-year note was in april 1993 .

the first auction of the reintroduced 7-year note occurred on february 26 , 2009 , with a settlement on march 2 , 2009 .

overview , schedules , and notes significant events in fiscal year 2009 , cont .

treasurydirect , bpd's internet - accessed retail system that is integral to treasury's goal of promoting paperless systems , continues to grow .

account establishments rose by 88 thousand this past year , from 696 thousand in fy 2008 to 784 thousand in fy 2009- - an increase of 13 percent .

treasurydirect became fully functional as it was expanded to enable entities such as trusts , corporations , fiduciaries , and estates to open accounts and conduct transactions .

bpd modified treasurydirect to support changes in treasury's auction schedule to offer 7-year notes and to more frequently re - open notes and bonds .

federal debt outstanding is one of the largest legally binding obligations of the federal government .

nearly all the federal debt has been issued by the treasury with a small portion being issued by other federal government agencies .

treasury issues debt securities for two principal reasons , ( 1 ) to borrow needed funds to finance the current operations of the federal government and ( 2 ) to provide an investment and accounting mechanism for certain federal government accounts' excess receipts , primarily trust funds .

total gross federal debt outstanding has dramatically increased over the past 25 years from $1,572 billion as of september 30 , 1984 , to $11,898 billion as of september 30 , 2009 ( see figure 5 ) .

large budget deficits emerged during the 1980's due to tax policy decisions and increased outlays for defense and domestic programs .

through fiscal year 1997 , annual federal deficits continued to be large and debt continued to grow at a rapid pace .

as a result , total federal debt increased more than three fold between 1984 and 1997 .

by fiscal year 1998 , federal debt held by the public was beginning to decline .

in fiscal years 1998 through 2001 , the amount of debt held by the public fell by $476 billion , from $3,815 billion to $3,339 billion .

however , federal debt held by the public began to increase in fiscal year 2002 as a result of higher federal outlays and tax policy decisions .

federal debt held by the public increased by 51.2 percent from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2007 .

from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 , federal debt held by the public increased an additional 49.6 percent rising by $2,503 billion .

this increase is primarily a result of the federal government's response to the financial market crisis and the economic downturn .

as a result , debt held by the public has increased from $3,339 billion in 2001 to $7,552 billion in 2009 .

historical perspective , cont .

even in those years where debt held by the public declined , total federal debt increased because of increases in intragovernmental debt holdings .

over the past 4 fiscal years , intragovernmental debt holdings increased by $1,029 billion , from $3,317 billion as of september 30 , 2005 , to $4,346 billion as of september 30 , 2009 .

by law , trust funds have the authority or are required to invest surpluses in federal securities .

as a result , the intragovernmental debt holdings balances primarily represent the cumulative surplus of funds due to the trust funds' cumulative annual excess of tax receipts , interest credited , and other collections compared to spending .

as shown in figure 6 , interest rates have fluctuated over the past 25 years .

the average interest rates reflected here represent the original issue weighted effective yield on securities outstanding at the end of the fiscal year .
