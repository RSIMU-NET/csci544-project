in our january 2013 report on the results of our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government ( cfs ) for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2012 and 2011 , we disclaimed an opinion on the cfs , except for the 2009 and 2008 statements of social insurance ( sosi ) , which received unqualified opinions .

since gao's first audit of the fiscal year 1997 cfs , certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and other limitations on the scope of our work have resulted in conditions that prevented us from expressing an opinion on the federal government's accrual - based consolidated financial statements .

these include material weaknesses that relate to the federal government's processes used to prepare the cfs.weaknesses involve the federal government's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal entities ; ensure that the federal government's accrual - based consolidated financial statements were ( 1 ) consistent with the underlying audited entities' financial statements , ( 2 ) properly balanced , and ( 3 ) in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ; and identify and either resolve or explain material differences between ( 1 ) certain components of the budget deficit reported in the department of the treasury's ( treasury ) records that are used to prepare the reconciliation of net operating cost and unified budget deficit , the statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities , and the fiscal projections for the u.s. government ( included in the unaudited required supplementary information section of the 2012 financial report of the united states government ( financial report ) ) and ( 2 ) related amounts reported in federal entities' financial statements and underlying financial information and records .

treasury , in coordination with the office of management and budget ( omb ) , prepares the cfs on behalf of the federal government.of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that have contributed to our continuing disclaimers of opinion on the federal government's accrual - based consolidated financial statements were several reported in detail along with related recommendations by other auditors in their audit reports on individual federal entities' financial statements .

the purpose of this report is to provide ( 1 ) detailed information on new control deficiencies identified during our fiscal year 2012 audit that relate to the processes used by treasury and omb to prepare the cfs , ( 2 ) 6 recommendations to address these new control deficiencies , and ( 3 ) the status of corrective actions taken by treasury and omb to address the 48 recommendations relating to the processes used by them to prepare the cfs , detailed in our previous reports , that remained open at the end of the fiscal year 2011 audit.recommendations at the end of the fiscal year 2012 audit .

of the 17 recommendations that have been closed , 7 were closed as a result of corrective actions taken by treasury .

we closed the other 10 recommendations by making 2 new recommendations in this report that are better aligned with the current status of the remaining internal control deficiencies associated with the budget statements included in the cfs and that reflect certain actions taken by treasury .

appendix i provides a summary of the status of actions taken to address the open recommendations from our previous reports as of january 9 , 2013 , the date of our report on the audit of the fiscal year 2012 cfs .

as part of our audit of the fiscal years 2012 and 2011 cfs , we considered the federal government's financial reporting procedures and related internal control .

also , we determined the status of corrective actions taken by treasury and omb to address open recommendations relating to the processes used by them to prepare the cfs that were detailed in our previous reports .

based on the scope of our work and the effects of the other limitations on the scope of our audit noted throughout our audit report on the fiscal year 2012 cfs , our internal control work would not necessarily identify all deficiencies in internal control , including those that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies .

we have communicated each of the new control deficiencies to your staff .

we performed our audit of the fiscal years 2012 and 2011 cfs in accordance with u.s. generally accepted government auditing standards .

we believe that our audit provided a reasonable basis for our conclusions in this report .

we requested comments on a draft of this report from the director of omb and the secretary of the treasury or their designees .

omb provided oral comments , which are summarized in the agency comments and our evaluation section of this report .

treasury's fiscal assistant secretary provided written comments on june 6 , 2013 , which are reprinted in their entirety in appendix ii and are also summarized in the agency comments and our evaluation section .

during our audit of the fiscal year 2012 cfs , we identified several new internal control deficiencies in treasury's and omb's processes used to prepare the cfs .

specifically , we found that treasury's procedures were not effectively designed to ( 1 ) reasonably assure the timely submission of audited material line items for significant calendar year - end federal entities , ( 2 ) determine the effect of restatements and reclassifications submitted by significant federal entities on related line items and notes presented in the cfs , and ( 3 ) ensure that the budget statements included in the cfs were prepared in a reliable manner .

we also notified omb of a reporting requirement in omb circular no .

a - 136 , financial reporting requirements , that may result in inconsistent and inaccurate reporting of compliance with the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 ( ffmia ) .

treasury's procedures were not effectively designed to reasonably assure the timely submission of audited material line items for significant calendar year - end federal entities .

significant federal entities are required to submit a closing package to treasury .

the closing package methodology is intended to link federal entities' audited consolidated department - level financial statements to certain statements of the cfs .

chief financial officers ( cfo ) of significant federal entities are required to verify the consistency of the closing package data with their respective entities' audited financial statements .

in addition , entity auditors are required to separately audit and report on the financial information in the closing packages .

for the three significant federal entities with a calendar year - end of december 31 , rather than a fiscal year - end of september 30 , the entity auditors are only required to audit and report on the financial information in the closing packages that contributes material amounts to line items in the cfs , as identified by treasury .

treasury's standard operating procedure ( sop ) entitled “significant federal entities identification” includes procedures for treasury to annually assess significant calendar year - end entities' financial statement line items to determine which line items are material to the financial report .

treasury's assessments are based on prior year financial information .

the sop also includes procedures for treasury to notify omb of changes in previously identified material line items .

omb is responsible for coordinating with each of the respective significant calendar year - end federal entities to obtain audit assurance over identified material line items through the closing package process .

during our audit of the fiscal year 2012 cfs , we found that treasury's sop did not include procedures to identify any material line items for significant calendar year - end entities that become material to the cfs during the current fiscal year , but that were not identified as material in the analysis using prior year financial information .

in addition , we found that treasury's sop did not reasonably assure that identified material line items were audited as part of the significant calendar year - end entities' closing package process in the year a line item becomes material , including affording omb adequate time to provide timely written notification to the significant calendar year - end entities of the line items that require audit coverage in the closing package process .

standards for internal control in the federal government provides that control activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that enforce management's directives .

the standards also provide that agencies are to ensure accurate and timely recording of transactions .

without the above - noted procedures , treasury and omb are unable to reasonably assure that they have appropriate audit assurance over material financial information for all significant calendar year - end entity line items .

to help provide reasonable assurance that treasury timely receives audited information for the material line items as part of the closing package process for the significant calendar year - end entities , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct the fiscal assistant secretary , working in coordination with the controller of omb , to enhance the sop entitled “significant federal entities identification” to include procedures for ( 1 ) identifying any material line items for significant calendar year - end entities that become material to the cfs during the current fiscal year but were not identified as material in the analysis using prior year financial information and ( 2 ) obtaining audit assurance over such identified material line items in the year they become material .

treasury's procedures were not effectively designed to determine the effect of restatements and reclassifications submitted by significant federal entities on related line items and notes presented in the cfs .

changes to amounts shown in previously issued financial statements can occur from restatements and reclassifications .

a restatement is the process of revising previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error in those financial statements .

a reclassification is the movement of a prior year amount in comparative financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation .

reclassifications can be from one line item to another , such as from inventory to other assets , or within components of a note to the financial statements .

significant federal entities that restate or reclassify their financial statements or notes are required to submit such changes to prior year amounts to treasury as part of the entities' closing package .

treasury's sop entitled “prior period adjustments” includes procedures for treasury to analyze restatements and reclassifications submitted by the significant federal entities .

during the preparation of the fiscal year 2012 cfs , treasury analyzed the effect , in the aggregate , of restatements and reclassifications submitted by significant federal entities on the net position and net cost reported in the cfs for the prior fiscal year .

treasury determined that the effect was not material with respect to prior fiscal year net position and net cost at the government - wide level and , as such , adjustments to the prior year financial statements were not needed .

however , we found that treasury's sop did not include procedures to analyze whether the effect of federal entity - submitted restatements and reclassifications on related line items and notes presented in the cfs was material .

standards for internal control in the federal government provides that control activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that enforce management's directives .

the standards also provide that agencies are to ensure accurate and timely recording of transactions .

although we did not find any instances in our fiscal year 2012 audit , a material change in a line item or note related to significant federal entities' submitted restatements and reclassifications could occur and not be identified , resulting in inconsistent reporting between current and prior fiscal year amounts , which may mislead readers of the financial report .

to reasonably assure the comparability of the cfs between the current and prior fiscal year , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct the fiscal assistant secretary to enhance the sop entitled “prior period adjustments” to include procedures for analyzing and assessing the effects of significant federal entities' restatements and reclassifications on related line items and notes presented in the cfs .

treasury's procedures were not effectively designed to ensure that the cfs budget statements , which consist of the reconciliation of net operating cost and unified budget deficit and statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities , were prepared in a reliable manner .

treasury uses a different approach for gathering federal entity data for the cfs budget statements than that of the closing package process used for the other cfs accrual - based financial statements .

specifically , the two cfs budget statements are not required statements at the federal entity level .

as such , for these statements , treasury uses the data , including the unified budget deficit amount ( the difference between outlays and receipts ) from its central summary general ledger system ( csgl ) , which is unaudited .

during our audit of the fiscal year 2012 cfs , we found that although treasury has made changes to its procedures and now documents its process for preparing the cfs budget statements , treasury had not established and implemented effective processes and procedures to reconcile ( 1 ) outlays and receipts as recorded in the csgl to outlays and receipts reported in the federal entities' audited financial statements and other financial data , ( 2 ) the operating results to the budget results , and ( 3 ) changes in cash and other monetary assets to the budget results .

we identified several errors in the draft cfs budget statements that may have been prevented had these reconciliations been effectively completed .

further , both of the cfs budget statements had at least one line item that included amounts that were unsupported but were needed to make the statement balance .

as a result , treasury continues to be unable to demonstrate that it has fully identified and reported all items needed to adequately prepare the cfs budget statements .

the federal accounting standards advisory board's statement of federal financial accounting concepts no .

4 , intended audience and qualitative characteristics for the consolidated financial report of the united states government , states that the consolidated financial report is a general purpose report that is aggregated from agency reports and tells users where to find information in other formats , both aggregated and disaggregated , such as individual agency reports , agency websites , and the president's budget .

until treasury is able to prepare the cfs budget statements in a manner that is fully consistent with the financial information from significant federal entities' audited financial statements , the cfs budget statements may not be reliable .

to improve the reliability of the information presented in the cfs budget statements , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct the fiscal assistant secretary , working in coordination with the controller of omb's office of federal financial management , to establish and implement effective procedures for ( 1 ) reporting amounts in the cfs budget statements that are fully consistent with the underlying information in significant federal entities' audited financial statements and other financial data and ( 2 ) identifying and reporting all items needed to prepare the cfs budget statements .

during our audit of the fiscal year 2012 cfs , we notified omb of a reporting requirement in omb circular no .

a - 136 that may result in inconsistent and inaccurate reporting of compliance with ffmia .

under ffmia , both cfo act entities and their auditors are required to make an annual determination as to whether an entity's financial management systems substantially comply with ( 1 ) federal financial management systems requirements , ( 2 ) applicable federal accounting standards , and ( 3 ) the u.s. standard general ledger at the transaction level .

consistent with the act , omb circular no .

a - 136 requires the cfo act entities to report annually on their determination , as well as their auditors' determination , of compliance with each of the three ffmia requirements in the summary of management assurances table in their respective annual financial reports or performance and accountability reports .

however , the circular also requires the cfo act entities to report on “overall substantial compliance” .

the requirement to report such information may create an appearance that the three separate system requirements are not equally important , and result in inconsistent and inaccurate reporting among entities and in the management's discussion and analysis section of the financial report .

in discussions with omb officials , they stated that omb plans to resolve the matter by removing the “overall substantial compliance” requirement in connection with omb's ongoing efforts to revise the circular .

to help assure the consistency and clarity of ffmia compliance reporting in cfo act entities' annual financial reports or performance and accountability reports and the management's discussion and analysis section of the financial report , we recommend that the director of omb ensure that omb continues its efforts to remove the requirement for reporting “overall substantial compliance” from omb circular no .

a - 136 , financial reporting requirements .

of our 48 recommendations from our prior reports regarding control deficiencies in the cfs preparation process that were open at the end of the fiscal year 2011 audit , we closed 17 recommendations during our fiscal year 2012 audit .

of the 17 closed recommendations , we closed 7 as a result of corrective actions taken by treasury .

we closed the other 10 recommendations , which were related to the cfs budget statements , by making 2 new recommendations in this report that are better aligned with the current status of the remaining internal control deficiencies associated with the budget statements and that reflect certain actions taken by treasury .

thirty - one recommendations from our prior reports remained open as of january 9 , 2013 , the date of our report on the audit of the fiscal year 2012 cfs .

appendix i summarizes the status as of january 9 , 2013 , of the 48 open recommendations from our prior years' reports .

specifically , appendix i includes the status according to treasury and omb , as well as our own assessments where appropriate .

the status of recommendations per gao includes explanatory comments on treasury's and omb's information .

we will continue to monitor treasury's and omb's progress in addressing our recommendations as part of our fiscal year 2013 cfs audit .

in oral comments on a draft of this report , omb generally concurred with the findings and recommendations in this report .

omb also provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate .

in written comments on a draft of this report , which are reprinted in appendix ii , treasury concurred with four of the five recommendations and stated that it will consider the recommendation related to the restatement and reclassification assessment .

we continue to believe that this assessment will help assure the comparability of the cfs between the current and prior fiscal year .

to address the long - standing material weakness related to intragovernmental transactions , treasury stated that it is continuing to develop the general fund reporting entity to address the intragovernmental elimination differences that occur when a federal entity records the general fund as a trading partner .

treasury is also working with federal entities and the audit community to develop and strengthen policy and guidance for reporting of intragovernmental transactions , including a number of measures intended to enhance the identification , resolution , and prevention of intragovernmental imbalances .

in addition , treasury noted that it is continuing its efforts to reconcile the budget deficit to federal entities' audited financial statements for the compilation of the two budget statements included in the cfs .

as the department of the treasury ( treasury ) is designing its new financial statement compilation process to begin with the fiscal year 2004 consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government ( cfs ) , the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary , in coordination with the controller of the office of management and budget ( omb ) , to develop reconciliation procedures that will aid in understanding and controlling the net position balance as well as eliminate the plugs previously associated with compiling the cfs .

to eliminate or explain adjustments to net position , treasury eliminates , at the consolidated level , intragovernmental activity and balances using formal balanced accounting entries ( via reciprocal categories ) and analyzes transactions that contribute to the unmatched transactions and balances adjustment i.e. , the plug .

major contributors to the plug are transactions with the general fund .

a treasury task group has developed the schedule of general fund authority and will enter fiscal year 2013 general fund data via journal voucher into the government - wide financial report system ( gfrs ) .

in the interim , treasury provides agencies with selected general fund data on a monthly basis to facilitate reconciliation of agency transactions with the general fund on a quarterly basis .

in addition , treasury issued new guidance in fiscal year 2013 for recording intragovernmental transactions and for resolving material differences .

in addition , throughout fiscal year 2013 , treasury will identify and resolve , via communications to , and assistance from , agencies , material differences related to fiduciary , benefits , buy / sell , and transfer activity via quarterly metrics and scorecard data to assist the agencies in identifying and mitigating root causes for differences and to implement both short - and long - term solutions .

examples of these differences would include capitalized purchases , such as inventory or equipment , and deferred revenue .

treasury's consolidating procedures include requests for information from the agencies related to asset capitalization and agency advances or deferred revenue to assist in ensuring the proper reporting of this activity .

recommendation the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary , in coordination with the controller of omb , to perform an assessment to define the reporting entity , including its specific components , in conformity with the criteria issued by the federal accounting standards advisory board ( fasab ) .

key decisions made in this assessment should be documented , including the reason for including or excluding components and the basis for concluding on any issue .

particular emphasis should be placed on demonstrating that any financial information that should be included but is not included is immaterial .

per treasury and omb during fiscal year 2013 , treasury will completely document treasury's assessment as to whether entities are to be included or excluded in the reporting entity in accordance with the fasab criteria .

as part of this assessment , treasury will also take into account fasab's reporting entity standard , once it is finalized .

the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary , in coordination with the controller of omb , to help ensure that federal agencies provide adequate information in their legal representation letters regarding the expected outcomes of the cases .

during fiscal year 2013 , treasury will work with the department of justice , omb , and gao and the agencies to determine if further changes in policy and / or guidance ( eg , omb circular a - 136 ) are needed for all agencies to provide the required information regarding the expected outcomes of legal cases in their legal representations .

open .

recommendation the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary , in coordination with the controller of omb , to establish written policies and procedures to help ensure that major treaty and other international agreement information is properly identified and reported in the cfs .

specifically , these policies and procedures should require that federal agencies develop a detailed schedule of all major treaties and other international agreements that obligate the u.s. government to provide cash , goods , or services , or that create other financial arrangements that are contingent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events ( a starting point for compiling these data could be the state department's treaties in force ) .

per treasury and omb agencies are currently required to report contingencies in their financial statements and notes pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) guidance .

in addition , omb circular a - 136 specifically references the inclusion of treaties and international agreements within “commitments and contingencies.” further , agencies include specific representations with respect to material liabilities or contingencies in their management representations .

in addition , the financial statements of most significant entities and many other federal entities received unqualified audit opinions .

however , no additional analysis of treaties has been performed to reasonably ensure that all of the federal government's treaties are considered in agency analyses or that agencies are consistently analyzing treaties for recognition or disclosure .

treasury will annually review agency financial statements , audit reports and management representation letters for any references to treaties and international agreements , and if deemed material will disclose in the cfs .

per gao open .

until a comprehensive analysis of major treaty and other international agreement information has been performed , treasury and omb are precluded from determining if additional disclosure is required by gaap in the cfs , and we are precluded from determining whether the omitted information is material .

the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary , in coordination with the controller of omb , to establish written policies and procedures to help ensure that major treaty and other international agreement information is properly identified and reported in the cfs .

specifically , these policies and procedures should require that federal agencies classify all such scheduled major treaties and other international agreements as commitments or contingencies .

5 , accounting for liabilities of the federal government , paragraph 106 , which requires that when financial information pursuant to financial accounting standards board standards on federal insurance and guarantee programs conducted by government corporations is incorporated in general purpose financial reports of a larger federal reporting entity , the entity should report as required supplementary information what amounts and periodic change in those amounts would be reported under the “risk assumed” approach .

per treasury and omb this information continues to be requested from federal agencies for disclosure in the cfs .

treasury , along with omb , will work with agencies to improve the consistency of this disclosure in the fiscal year 2013 cfs and will also monitor the work of the fasab task force that is reviewing the reporting for risk assumed .

treasury's reporting in this area is not complete .

the cfs should include all major federal insurance programs in the risk assumed reporting and analysis .

also , since future events are uncertain , risk assumed information should include indicators of the range of uncertainty around expected estimates , including indicators of the sensitivity of the estimate to changes in major assumptions .

the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary to develop a process that will allow full reporting of the changes in cash balance of the u.s. government .

specifically , the process should provide for reporting on the change in cash reported on the consolidated balance sheet , which should be linked to cash balances reported in federal agencies' audited financial statements .

the secretary of the treasury should direct the fiscal assistant secretary , in coordination with the controller of omb , to modify treasury's plans for the new closing package to ( 1 ) require federal agencies to directly link their audited financial statement notes to the cfs notes and ( 2 ) provide the necessary information to demonstrate that all of the five principal consolidated financial statements are consistent with the underlying information in federal agencies' audited financial statements and other financial data .

treasury's current cfs compilation process provides for direct linkage from the 35 significant federal agencies' audited financial statements to most of the cfs principal statements and to the related note disclosures .

however , additional work is needed related to the two budgetary financial statements .

open .

treasury's process for compiling the cfs generally demonstrated that amounts in the statement of social insurance and the statement of changes in social insurance amounts were consistent with the underlying federal entities' audited financial statements and that the balance sheet and the statement of net cost were also consistent with the 35 significant federal entities' financial statements prior to eliminating intragovernmental activity and balances .

however , treasury's process did not ensure that the information in the remaining three principal financial statements ( statement of operations and changes in net position , reconciliation of net operating cost and unified budget deficit , and statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities ) was fully consistent with the underlying information in the 35 significant federal entities' audited financial statements and other financial data .

with regard to directly linking the last two statements to federal entities' audited financial statements and other financial data , we have incorporated this issue along with other control deficiencies related to the two cfs budget statements into new recommendations for corrective action in this report under “preparation of the budget statements included in the cfs. .
