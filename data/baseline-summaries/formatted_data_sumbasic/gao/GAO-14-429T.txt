on behalf of the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) , i appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fiscal year ( fy ) 2015 budget request .

i also want to thank the subcommittee for its continued support of gao and the confidence you have shown in our efforts to help support the congress .

with congress's support , our fy 2014 funding will allow gao to increase its staff capacity to 2,945 full - time equivalents ( fte ) .

this level reverses a downward fte trajectory and allows us to make progress towards our optimal fte level of 3,250 .

gao's fy 2015 budget request of $525.1 million represents an increase of 3.9 percent that will preserve the 2,945 fte level planned for fy 2014 , as well as allow for needed maintenance and improvements to our information technology ( it ) and building infrastructures .

this will ensure we have the staff capacity to support congress in carrying out its responsibilities and oversight .

gao remains one of the best investments in the federal government , and our dedicated staff continues to deliver high quality results .

in fy 2013 alone , gao provided services that spanned the broad range of federal programs and activities .

we received requests for our work from 95 percent of the standing committees of congress and almost two - thirds of their subcommittees .

we reviewed a wide range of government programs and operations including those that are at high risk for fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement .

gao also reviewed agencies' budgets as requested to help support congressional decision - making .

last year , our work yielded significant results across the government , including $51.5 billion in financial benefits — a return of about $100 for every dollar invested in gao .

also , in fy 2013 , we issued 709 reports and made 1,430 new recommendations .

the findings of our work were often cited in house and senate deliberations and committee reports to support congressional action , including improving federal programs on our high risk list ; addressing overlap , duplication , and fragmentation ; and assessing defense , border security and immigration issues .

our findings also supported the bipartisan budget act of 2013 , in areas such as aviation security fees , unemployment insurance , improper payments to inmates , the strategic petroleum reserve , and the contractor compensation cap .

senior gao officials also provided testimony 114 times before 60 committees or subcommittees on a wide range of issues that touched virtually all major federal agencies .

a list of selected topics addressed is included in appendix i .

gao's findings and recommendations produce measurable financial benefits through congressional action or agency implementation .

examples of fy 2013 financial benefits resulting from congressional or federal agency implementation of gao recommendations include: $8.7 billion from reducing procurement quantities of the joint strike fighter program: dod decreased near - term procurement quantities in three successive budget submissions to lessen concurrency and the associated cost risks in light of our numerous recommendations citing the f - 35 joint strike fighter program's very aggressive and risky acquisition strategy , including substantial overlap among development , testing , and production activities .

$2.6 billion from revising the approach for the navy's next generation enterprise network ( ngen ) acquisition: our recommendations led navy to revise its ngen acquisition strategy — which was riskier and potentially costlier than other alternatives identified due to a higher number of contractual relationships — thus significantly reducing program costs between 2013 and 2017 .

$2.5 billion from eliminating seller - funded payment assistance for fha - insured mortgages: the department of housing and urban development and congress took steps to prohibit seller - funded down payment assistance , citing our findings that losses associated with those loans had substantially higher delinquency and insurance claim rates than similar loans without such assistance , and were contributing to the federal housing administration's deteriorating financial performance .

$2.3 billion from consolidating u.s .

forces stationed in europe: dod removed two brigade combat teams and support units from europe , allowing it to further consolidate and close facilities , based in part on our work showing significant costs related to maintaining permanent army forces in europe and our recommendations that dod identify alternatives that might lead to savings .

$1.3 billion through improved tax compliance: our recommendations on the use of information reporting to reduce the tax gap contributed to legislation requiring banks and others to report income that merchants receive through credit cards , third - party networks , and other means to help irs verify information reported on merchants' income tax returns .

the estimated increased revenue through improved tax compliance is expected over the provision's first 3 fiscal years .

gao has generated recommendations that save resources , increase government revenue , improve the accountability , operations , and services of government agencies , increase the effectiveness of federal spending as well as provide other benefits .

since fy 2003 , gao's work has resulted in substantial financial and other benefits for the american people , including: over ½ trillion dollars in financial benefits ; about 14,500 program and operational benefits that helped to change laws , improve public services , and promote sound management throughout government ; and about 12,000 reports , testimony , and other gao products that included over 22,000 recommendations .

in fy 2013 , gao also contributed to 1,314 program and operational benefits that helped to change laws , improve public services , and promote sound management throughout government .

thirty six percent of these benefits are related to business process and management , 31 percent are related to public safety and security , 17 percent are related to program efficiency and effectiveness , 8 percent are related to acquisition and contract management , 5 percent are related to public insurance and benefits , and 3 percent are related to tax law administration .

examples include: enhancing coordination between dod and the social security administration ( ssa ) on the more timely delivery of military medical records through electronic transfer ; improving veterans affairs ( va ) oversight of its medical equipment and supply purchasing ; increasing collaboration between the army and veterans affairs through a joint working group to improve management of military cemeteries and help eliminate burial errors and other past problems ; updating federal emergency management administration ( fema ) national flood insurance program contract monitoring policies to reduce the likelihood that contractor performance problems would go unnoticed ; and establishing national oceanic and atmospheric administration policies outlining the processes , roles and responsibilities for transitioning tsunami research into operations at tsunami warning centers .

in fy 2013 gao issued its third annual report on overlap , duplication , and fragmentation .

in it , we identified 31 new areas where agencies may be able to achieve greater efficiency or effectiveness .

within these 31 areas , we identified 81 actions that the executive branch and congress could take to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication , as well as other cost savings and revenue enhancement opportunities .

this work identifies opportunities for the federal government to save billions of dollars .

we also maintain a scorecard and action tracker on our external website where congress , federal agencies , and the public can monitor progress in addressing our findings .

federal agencies and congress have made some progress in addressing the 131 areas we identified and taking the 300 actions that we recommended in our 2011 and 2012 reports .

in february 2013 gao issued the biennial update of our high risk report , which focuses attention on government operations that are at high risk of fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement , or need transformation to address economy , efficiency , or effectiveness challenges .

this report , which will be updated in 2015 , offers solutions to 30 identified high - risk problems and the potential to save billions of dollars , improve service to the public , and strengthen the performance and accountability of the u.s. government .

our 2013 high risk work produced 164 reports , 35 testimonies , $17 billion in financial benefits , and 411 program and operational benefits .

the major cross - cutting high risk program areas identified as of september 2013 range from transforming dod program management and managing federal contracting more effectively , to assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of tax law administration and modernizing and safeguarding insurance and benefit programs .

the complete list of high - risk areas is shown on appendix ii .

details on each high risk area can be found at http: / / www.gao.gov / highrisk / overview .

gao's fy 2014 budget request sought statutory authority for a new electronic docketing system to be funded by a filing fee collected from companies filing bid protests .

the sole purpose of the filing fee would be to offset the cost of developing , implementing , and maintaining the system .

we appreciate that the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 , directed gao to develop an electronic filing and document dissemination system under which persons may electronically file bid protests and documents may be electronically disseminated to the parties .

gao is making progress in establishing the electronic protest docketing system .

we have convened an interdisciplinary team of experts within gao to examine matters such as technical requirements , the potential for commercially available systems , fee structure , cost - benefit analysis , and outreach to stakeholders , including representatives from the small business community .

gao will be reporting regularly to the house and senate committees on appropriations on its progress in implementing the system .

in september 2013 , gao launched the watchdog website , which provides information exclusively to members and congressional staff through the house and senate intranets .

the new site is designed to provide a more interactive interface for members and their staff to request our assistance and to access our ongoing work .

in addition , watchdog can help users quickly find gao's issued reports and legal decisions as well as key contact information .

in december 2013 , members and their staff were invited to comment on our draft strategic plan for serving congress in fys 2014-2019 .

the draft plan was issued in february 2014 and outlines our proposed goals and strategies for supporting congress's top priorities .

our strategic plan framework ( appendix iii ) summarizes the global trends , as well as the strategic goals and objectives that guide our work .

gao's strategic goals and objectives are shown in figure 1 .

the draft strategic plan also summarizes the trends shaping the united states and its place in the world .

the plan reflects the areas of work we plan to undertake , including science and technology , weapons systems , the environment , and energy .

we also will increase collaboration with other national audit offices to get a better handle on global issues that directly affect the united states , including international financial markets ; food safety ; and medical and pharmaceutical products .

these trends include: u.s. national security interests ; fiscal sustainability and challenges ; global interdependence and multinational cooperation ; science and technology ; communication networks and information technology ; shifting roles in governance and government ; and demographic and societal changes .

in the upcoming decade , for example , the us will face demographic changes that will have significant fiscal impacts both on the federal budget and the economy .

the number of baby boomers turning 65 is projected to grow from an average of about 7,600 per day in 2011 , to more than 11,600 per day in 2025 , driving spending for major health and retirement programs .

to ensure the updated strategic plan reflects the needs of congress and the nation , we have solicited comments from stakeholders in addition to congress , including gao advisory entities , the congressional budget office , and the congressional research service .

to manage our congressional workload , we continue to take steps to ensure our work supports congressional legislative and oversight priorities and focuses on areas where there is the greatest potential for results such as cost savings and improved government performance .

ways that we actively work with congressional committees in advance of new statutory mandates include 1 ) identifying mandates real time as bills are introduced ; 2 ) participating in ongoing discussions with congressional staff ; and 3 ) collaborating to ensure that the work is properly scoped and is consistent with the committee's highest priorities .

in fy 2013 , 35 percent of our audit resources were devoted to mandates and 61 percent to congressional requests .

i have met with the chairs and ranking members of many of the standing committees and their subcommittees to hear firsthand feedback on our performance , as well as highlight the need to prioritize requests for our services to maximize the return on investment .

gao also appreciates congress's assistance in repealing or revising statutory mandates that are either outdated or need to be revised .

this helps streamline gao's workload and ensure we are better able to meet current congressional priorities .

during the second session of the 112th congress , based on our input , 16 of gao's mandated reporting requirements were revised or repealed because over time they had lost relevance or usefulness .

in addition , gao worked with responsible committees to have 6 more mandates repealed or revised as part of the 2014 national defense authorization act .

gao has identified 11 additional mandates for revision or repeal and is currently working with the appropriate committees to implement these changes .

for example , our request includes language to repeal a requirement for gao to conduct bimonthly reviews of state and local use of recovery act funds .

as the vast majority of recovery act funds have been spent , gao's reviews in this area are providing diminishing returns for congress .

gao is seeking authority to establish a center for audit excellence to improve domestic and international auditing capabilities .

the center also will provide an important tool for promoting good governance , transparency and accountability .

there is a worldwide demand for an organization with gao's expertise and stature to assume a greater leadership role in developing institutional capacity in other audit offices and provide training and technical assistance throughout the domestic and international auditing communities .

the proposed center would operate on a fee - basis , generating revenue to sustain its ongoing operation , including the cost of personnel and instructors .

the center would be primarily staffed with retired gao and other auditors , and thus , would not detract from or impact the service gao provides to congress .

in a similar vein , to provide staff from other federal agencies with developmental experiences , gao is requesting authority to accept staff from other agencies on a non - reimbursable basis , who can learn about gao's work .

this would allow people to develop expertise and gain experience that will enhance their work at their own agencies .

we take great pride in reporting that we continue to be recognized as an employer of choice , and have been consistently ranked near the top on “best places to work” lists .

in 2013 , we ranked third overall among mid - sized federal agencies on the partnership for public service's “best places to work” list , and again ranked number one in our support of diversity .

also , in november 2013 , washingtonian magazine named us as one of the “50 great places to work” in the washington , d.c. region among public or private entities .

in addition , earlier this year , o.c .

tanner , a company that develops employee recognition programs , cited us in its article , “top 10 coolest companies to work for in washington , d.c.” our management continues to work with our union ( ifpte , local 1921 ) , the employee advisory council , and the diversity advisory council to make gao a preferred place to work .

gao's fy 2015 budget request will preserve staff capacity and continue critical infrastructure investments .

offsetting receipts and reimbursements primarily from program and financial audits and rental income totaling $30.9 million are expected in fy 2015 .

the requested resources provide the funds necessary to ensure that gao can meet the highest priority needs of congress and produce results to help the federal government deal effectively with its serious fiscal and other challenges .

a summary of gao's appropriations for our fy 2010 baseline and fys 2013 to 2015 is shown in figure 2 .

the requested funding supports a staffing level of 2,945 ftes , and provides funding for mandatory pay costs , staff recognition and benefits programs , and activities to support congressional engagements and operations .

these funds are essential to ensure gao can address succession planning challenges , provide staff meaningful benefits and appropriate resources , and compete with other agencies , nonprofit institutions , and private firms who offer these benefits to the talent gao seeks .

in order to address the priorities of congress , gao needs a talented , diverse , high - performing , knowledgeable workforce .

however , a significant proportion of our employees are currently retirement eligible , including 34 percent of our executive leadership and 21 percent of our supervisory analysts .

therefore , workforce and succession planning remain a priority for gao .

moreover , for the first time in several years our budget allows us to replenish the much needed pipeline of entry level and experienced analysts to meet future workload challenges .

in fy 2014 , through a targeted recruiting gao plans to hire entry - level staff and student interns , boosting our staff capacity for the first time in 3 years to 2,945 fte .

this will allow gao to reverse the downward trend in our ftes and achieve some progress in reaching our optimal staffing level of 3,250 fte , and develop a talent pool for the future .

our fy 2015 budget request seeks funding to maintain the 2,945 fte level .

in fy 2015 , pending final opm guidance , we also plan to implement a phased retirement program to incentivize potential retirement eligible staff to remain with gao and assist in mentoring and sharing knowledge with staff .

efforts to address challenges related to gao's internal operations primarily relate to our engagement efficiency , information technology and building infrastructure needs .

to better serve congress and the public , we expanded our presence in digital and social media , releasing gao iphone and android applications , and launching streaming video web chats with the public .

during the past year , 7,600 additional people began receiving our reports and legal decisions through our twitter feed .

more than 26,600 people now get our reports , testimonies , and legal decisions daily on twitter .

gao remains focused on improving the efficiency of our engagements through streamlining or standardizing processes without sacrificing quality .

in fys 2012 and 2013 , we continued our improvements in this area .

for example , with active involvement from gao's managing directors , we identified changes to key steps and decision points in our engagement process and now have a revised engagement process that we began implementing on a pilot basis in january 2014 .

we also piloted and revised a tool to help teams better estimate expected staff days required for engagements .

in fy 2014 , we plan to implement a series of process changes that will transform the management of engagements , the use of resources , and message communication .

more efficient content creation , review , and publication gao will strive to dramatically improve the efficiency of our content creation and management processes by standardizing , automating , and streamlining the currently cumbersome and manually intensive processes for creating , fact - checking , and publishing gao products .

in fy 2014 , we plan to request proposals to acquire a technical solution and phase implementation in fys 2014 and 2015 .

the proposed system will automate document routing and approvals , incorporate management and quality assurance steps , and generate required documentation .

to ensure our message is available to both our clients and the public , the proposed system capability will also enable gao to routinely publish content on gao.gov , gao's mobile site , and various social media platforms .

greater transparency of engagement information to promote transparency , increase management capabilities , and reduce duplicate data entry and costs , in fy 2014 gao will begin implementing a modernized , one - stop engagement management system .

this system automates key business rules and decision points , improves resource management , eliminates rework , and provides increased visibility for all participants .

in fy 2015 , we will retire legacy databases as the new system becomes fully operational .

the fy 2015 budget also provides funds to maintain our information technology ( it ) systems , which are a critical element in our goal to maintain efficient and effective business operations and to provide the data needed to inform timely management decisions .

improvements to our aging it infrastructure will allow gao to further streamline business operations , reduce redundant efforts , increase staff efficiency and productivity , improve access to information , and enhance our technology infrastructure to support an array of engagement management , human capital , and financial management systems .

gao also plans to continue upgrading aging building systems to ensure more efficient operations and security .

to support these requirements our fy 2015 budget request includes resources to: begin upgrading the heating , ventilation , and air conditioning system to increase energy efficiency and reliability ; repair items identified in our long - range asset management plan , such as the water heater , chiller plant , and cooling fans ; enhance continuity planning and emergency preparedness address bomb blast impact mitigation efforts .

in conclusion , gao values the opportunity to provide congress and the nation with timely , insightful analysis .

the fy 2015 budget requests the resources to ensure that we can continue to address the highest priorities of congress .

our request seeks an increase to maintain our staffing level and provide employees with the appropriate resources and support needed to effectively serve congress .

the funding level will also allow us to continue efforts to promote operational efficiency , and begin addressing long - deferred investments and maintenance .

this concludes my prepared statement .

i appreciate , as always , your continued support and careful consideration of our budget .

i look forward to discussing our fy 2015 request with you .
