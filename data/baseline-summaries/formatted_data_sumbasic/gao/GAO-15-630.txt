the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , in coordination with the office of management and budget ( omb ) , prepares the cfs on behalf of the federal government.control over financial reporting that have contributed to our continuing disclaimers of opinion on the federal government's accrual - based consolidated financial statements were reported in detail along with related recommendations made by other auditors in their audit reports on individual federal entities' financial statements .

several of the material weaknesses in internal the purpose of this report is to provide ( 1 ) detailed information on three new control deficiencies identified during our fiscal year 2014 audit that relate to the processes used by treasury and omb to prepare the cfs , along with related recommendations , and ( 2 ) the status of corrective actions treasury and omb have taken to address the 31 recommendations relating to the processes to prepare the cfs , detailed in our previous reports , that remained open at the end of the fiscal year 2013 audit.as of february 19 , 2015 , the date of our report on the audit of the fiscal year 2014 cfs , to address the open recommendations from our previous reports .

as part of our audit of the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 cfs , we considered the federal government's financial reporting procedures and related internal control .

also , we determined the status of corrective actions treasury and omb have taken to address open recommendations relating to their processes to prepare the cfs that were detailed in our previous reports .

a full discussion of our scope and methodology is included in our february 2015 report on our audit of the we have communicated each of the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 cfs.control deficiencies discussed in this report to your staff .

we performed our audit of the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 cfs in accordance with u.s. generally accepted government auditing standards .

we believe that our audit provided a reasonable basis for our conclusions in this report .

during our audit of the fiscal year 2014 cfs , we identified three new internal control deficiencies in treasury's processes used to prepare the cfs .

specifically , we found that treasury did not have ( 1 ) a sufficient process to work with key federal entities prior to the end of the fiscal year to reasonably assure that new or substantially revised federal accounting standards were consistently implemented by the entities to allow appropriate consolidation at the government - wide level , ( 2 ) procedures for determining whether entities and transactions for which it does not have audit assurance are significant in the aggregate to the cfs , and ( 3 ) sufficient procedures for ( a ) identifying significant increases or decreases in all cfs line items and disclosures from prior fiscal year reported amounts and ( b ) understanding the reasons for such changes .

treasury did not have a sufficient process to work with key federal entities prior to the end of the fiscal year to reasonably assure that new or substantially revised federal accounting standards were consistently implemented by the entities to allow appropriate consolidation at the government - wide level .

for example , for the financial report of the united states government ( financial report ) , the federal accounting standards advisory board's ( fasab ) technical bulletin 2011-1 , accounting for federal natural resources other than oil and gas , requires a concise statement as part of required supplementary information ( rsi ) explaining the nature and valuation of federal natural resources .

the statement is to encompass significant federal natural resources other than oil and gas under management by the federal government .

for fiscal year 2014 , only one federal entity ( the department of the interior ) provided to treasury a discussion of significant federal natural resources under entity management , specifically related to coal leases .

as a result , the rsi for federal natural resources other than oil and gas included in the fiscal year 2014 financial report reported only coal leases from the department of the interior .

the rsi did not describe coal resources that are not currently under lease or certain other natural resources owned by the federal government .

we communicated this matter to treasury and omb officials who revised the financial report before issuance , as appropriate .

we found that treasury has a process to work with federal entities when implementing new and revised federal accounting standards .

specifically , treasury presents the standards for discussion at regularly scheduled monthly meetings — called central reporting team meetings — that include financial reporting representatives from federal entities .

treasury also updates the treasury financial manual , its financial reporting guidance for federal entities , to include new reporting requirements .

this process was followed in implementing technical bulletin 2011-1 in fiscal year 2014 .

however , this process is not sufficient to reasonably assure that new or substantially revised federal accounting standards are consistently implemented by the entities .

in a prior year , after we identified inconsistencies in the information reported to treasury related to the implementation of fasab statement of federal financial accounting standards ( sffas ) no .

33 , treasury established a working group involving the key federal entities affected by the standard .

the group met several times to discuss the standard and through such discussions was able to identify and resolve inconsistencies in the reporting of information for consolidation at the government - wide level .

however , treasury has not adopted a similar process for implementing subsequent standards .

federal financial statements are to be presented in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) .

fasab , the body designated as the source of gaap for federal reporting entities , regularly issues new and revised standards , including two new federal accounting standards that are to be implemented in fiscal year 2015 .

without a sufficient process to work with key federal entities to reasonably assure that new or substantially revised federal accounting standards are consistently implemented by the entities , there is an increased risk of misstatements in the financial statements or incomplete and inaccurate disclosure of information within the financial report .

we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct the fiscal assistant secretary to develop and implement a sufficient process to work with key federal entities prior to the end of the fiscal year to reasonably assure that new or substantially revised federal accounting standards are consistently implemented by the responsible entities to allow appropriate consolidation at the government - wide level .

treasury did not have procedures for determining whether entities and transactions for which it does not have audit assurance are significant in the aggregate to the cfs .

treasury's standard operating procedure ( sop ) entitled “significant entities” includes procedures for identifying federal entities with activity that is material to at least one financial statement line item or note disclosure .

each federal entity identified as significant is to submit an audited closing package to treasury .

the closing package methodology is intended to link federal entities' audited consolidated department - level financial statements to certain statements of the cfs .

chief financial officers of significant federal entities are required to verify the consistency of the closing package data with their respective entities' audited financial statements .

in addition , entity auditors are required to separately audit and report on the financial information in the closing packages .

however , the sop did not include , and therefore treasury did not perform , procedures for determining whether entities and amounts that were not included in a closing package , and thus for which treasury did not have audit assurance , were significant to the cfs in the aggregate before the cfs was finalized .

specifically , we found that treasury's sop did not include procedures for assessing the significance of aggregate amounts for which it does not have audit assurance , including amounts related to the following: non - significant entities , which are not required to submit audited closing packages ; significant entities that did not submit audited closing packages ; nonmaterial line items for significant calendar year - end entities ; material line items for calendar year - end entities that did not submit audited closing packages ; journal vouchers processed by treasury that were not based on the closing packages ; and uncorrected misstatements identified at the consolidated level , including uncorrected misstatements submitted by the significant entities with their closing packages .

standards for internal control in the federal government provides that control activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that enforce management's directives.provide that an entity should accurately record transactions and events — from initiation to summary records — and that control activities include procedures to achieve accurate recording of transactions and events .

without procedures for determining whether aggregate amounts for which treasury does not have audit assurance are significant to the cfs , there is an increased risk of material misstatements in the financial statements .

we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct the fiscal assistant secretary to develop and implement procedures for determining whether entities and transactions for which treasury does not have audit assurance are significant in the aggregate to the cfs .

treasury did not have sufficient procedures for ( 1 ) identifying significant increases or decreases in all cfs line items and disclosures from prior fiscal year reported amounts and ( 2 ) understanding the reasons for such changes .

treasury's sop entitled “preparation of the financial report” includes procedures for performing an overall variance analysis at the consolidated line item level for the balance sheet , statement of net cost , statement of operations and changes in net position , and related notes to the balance sheet .

the variance analysis compares the amounts for the current and prior years and provides an explanation for material changes.anomalies in the data that , if unexplained , could indicate misstatements in the data .

however , the sop did not include , and therefore treasury did not perform , an overall variance analysis on the remaining cfs line items and disclosures where comparable amounts were presented .

this includes the cfs budget statements , which consist of the reconciliation of net operating cost and unified budget deficit and statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities ; non - balance sheet notes ; rsi ; required supplementary stewardship information ; and other information .

such variance analysis helps identify unusual trends or standards for internal control in the federal government provides that control activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that enforce management's directives .

the standards also provide that an entity should accurately record transactions and events — from initiation to summary records — and that control activities include procedures to achieve accurate recording of transactions and events .

without sufficient procedures for identifying and understanding significant changes from prior year reported amounts , there is an increased risk of misstatements in the financial statements or incomplete and inaccurate disclosure of information within the financial report .

we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct the fiscal assistant secretary to develop and implement procedures for identifying significant increases or decreases in all cfs line items and disclosures from prior fiscal year reported amounts and for understanding the reasons for such changes .

at the end of the fiscal year 2013 audit , 31 recommendations from our prior reports regarding control deficiencies in the processes used to prepare the cfs were open .

treasury implemented corrective actions during fiscal year 2014 that resulted in significant progress in resolving certain of the control deficiencies addressed by our recommendations .

for 7 recommendations , the corrective actions resolved the related control deficiencies , and we closed the recommendations .

while progress was made , 24 recommendations from our prior reports remained open as of february 19 , 2015 , the date of our report on the audit of the fiscal year 2014 cfs .

consequently , a total of 27 recommendations need to be addressed — 24 remaining from prior reports and the 3 new recommendations we are making in this report .

appendix i summarizes the status as of february 19 , 2015 , of the 31 open recommendations from our prior reports , including the status according to treasury and omb , as well as our own assessment and additional comments where appropriate .

various efforts are under way to address these recommendations .

we will continue to monitor treasury's and omb's progress in addressing our recommendations as part of our fiscal year 2015 cfs audit .

in oral comments on a draft of this report , omb generally concurred with the findings and recommendations of this report .

in written comments on a draft of this report , which are reprinted in appendix ii , treasury concurred with our three new recommendations .

treasury also provided details on its ongoing efforts to address the material weaknesses that relate to the federal government's processes used to prepare the cfs .

to address the material weakness related to intragovernmental transactions , treasury stated that it will continue to devote significant resources toward resolving the material weakness and , in order to resolve systemic intragovernmental differences , treasury has requested that federal agencies provide it with root cause information and corrective action plans .

regarding the material weakness related to the compilation process , treasury stated that it continued to implement software and processes to automate and streamline the compilation of the financial report , and that in fiscal year 2015 , it will focus on collecting critical information from reporting entities identified as significant to the financial report , including entities in the legislative and judicial branches .

in addition , treasury noted that it is continuing its efforts to validate material completeness of budgetary information included in the financial report , as well as the consistency of such information with agency reports .
