the department of homeland security ( dhs ) was established by the homeland security act of 2002 and began operations in 2003 .

that year , we designated implementing and transforming dhs as high risk because dhs had to transform 22 agencies — several with major management challenges — into one department .

further , failure to effectively address dhs's management and mission risks could have serious consequences for u.s. national and economic security .

given the significant effort required to build and integrate a department as large and complex as dhs , our initial high - risk designation addressed the department's implementation and transformation efforts to include associated management and programmatic challenges .

we reported that the creation of dhs was an enormous undertaking and successfully transforming large organizations , even those undertaking less strenuous reorganizations , could take years to implement .

over the past 15 years , the focus of this high - risk area has evolved in tandem with dhs's maturation and evolution .

the overriding tenet has consistently remained dhs's ability to build a single , cohesive , and effective department that is greater than the sum of its parts — a goal that requires effective collaboration and integration of its various components and management functions .

dhs's office of strategy , policy , and plans ( plcy ) is responsible for some of these management functions , including developing and coordinating departmentwide policies and strategies , conducting analyses for senior leadership , and supporting the secretary's initiatives .

for example , plcy develops and disseminates departmentwide policies in the form of directives and instructions , strategy documents required by statute , operational plans , and reports for congress .

the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ( ndaa ) , enacted in december 2016 , established plcy in statute .

although largely consistent with the roles and responsibilities of dhs's office of policy , as plcy was named before enactment of the ndaa , implementation of the act required organizational changes designed to respond to certain challenges the office had identified as barriers to its ability to perform effectively .

for a number of years , questions have been raised about the office's efficacy and engagement with key stakeholders , like the dhs operational components .

for example , we have reported on challenges related to obtaining stakeholder feedback under the office's leadership of the 2010 and 2014 quadrennial homeland security reviews ( qhsr ) .

we have also reported on opportunities for select components of the office — the screening coordination office and the office of international affairs — to implement better management controls to help enhance monitoring and accountability for their respective missions .

dhs agreed with all of our recommendations in those prior reports .

in light of past concerns about efficacy and the recent statutory changes , you asked us to review how plcy is contributing to efforts to build a single , cohesive department by driving departmentwide and crosscutting strategy and policy .

this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) dhs has established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position plcy to achieve its organizational objectives , ( 2 ) dhs and plcy have ensured that plcy's workforce is aligned with plcy's and dhs's priorities and goals , and ( 3 ) plcy has effectively engaged across the operational components to identify and respond to emerging policy and strategy needs .

to address all three objectives , we analyzed key documents and interviewed officials from plcy and other dhs offices , including officials responsible for policy , strategy , and plan development and implementation at all eight of dhs's operational components .

specifically , to better understand the roles and responsibilities of plcy , dhs's eight operational components , and other offices at dhs , we reviewed the ndaa and analyzed documents , such as departmental directives that describe what is required and expected of each office .

in addition , we interviewed officials from plcy to understand its roles and responsibilities , workforce planning practices , and collaboration with dhs operational components .

furthermore , we interviewed officials from dhs's office of the under secretary for management to understand the differences between plcy's roles and responsibilities and those of the office of the under secretary for management , who oversees all internal management operations and oversight of management functions for components at dhs headquarters .

to further understand plcy's engagement with dhs operational components as well as their perspectives on plcy's roles and responsibilities , we conducted both unstructured and structured interviews with each of dhs's eight operational components .

for the structured interviews , we developed a questionnaire that we tested internally before administering it to dhs officials .

at the structured interviews , we asked officials at each operational component the same questions in the same order to ensure we collected information consistently and reliably across the different respondents .

we compared our findings to standards for internal control in the federal government , leading collaboration practices identified in our prior work , and the dhs workforce planning guide to determine the extent to which plcy is able to achieve its goals given its organizational structure , workforce planning , and communication and collaboration with operational components .

we conducted this performance audit from july 2017 to september 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .

those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .

we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .

with the passage of the ndaa in december 2016 , plcy is to be led by an under secretary for strategy , policy , and plans , who is appointed by the president with advice and consent of the senate .

the under secretary is to report directly to the secretary of homeland security .

prior to the ndaa , the office was headed by an assistant secretary .

since the passage of the act , the undersecretary position has been vacant , and as of june 5 , 2018 , the president had not nominated an individual to fill the position .

according to plcy officials , elevating the head of the office to an undersecretary was important because it equalizes plcy with other dhs management offices and dhs headquarters components .

the ndaa further authorizes , but does not require , the secretary to establish a position of deputy undersecretary within plcy .

if the position is established , the ndaa provides that the secretary may appoint a career employee to the position ( i.e. , not a political appointee ) .

in march 2018 , the secretary named a deputy under secretary , who has been performing the duties of the deputy under secretary and the under secretary since then .

as shown in figure 1 , plcy is divided into five sub - offices , each with a different focus area .

as of june 5 , 2018 , the top position in these sub - offices was an assistant secretary and two of the five positions were vacant .

as of june 5 , 2018 , 6 of plcy's 12 deputy assistant secretary positions were vacant or filled by acting staff temporarily performing the duties in the absence of permanent staff placement .

the ndaa codified many of the functions and responsibilities that plcy had been carrying out prior to the act's enactment and , with a few exceptions as discussed later in this report , were largely consistent with the duties the office was already pursuing .

according to the act and plcy officials , one of the office's fundamental responsibilities is to lead , conduct , and coordinate departmentwide policy development and implementation , and strategic planning .

according to plcy officials , there are four categories of policy and strategy efforts that plcy leads , conducts , or coordinates: statutory responsibilities: among others , the homeland security act , as amended by the ndaa , includes such responsibilities as establishing standards of validity and reliability for statistical data collected by the department , conducting or overseeing analysis and reporting of such data , and maintaining all immigration statistical information of u.s. customs and border protection , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement , and u.s .

citizenship and immigration services ; the immigration and nationality act includes such responsibilities as providing for a system for collection and dissemination to congress and the public of information useful in evaluating the social , economic , environmental , and demographic impact of immigration laws , and reporting annually on trends in lawful immigration flows , naturalizations , and enforcement actions , representing dhs in interagency efforts: coordinating or representing departmental policy and strategy positions for larger interagency efforts ( eg , interagency policy committees convened by the white house ) , secretary's priorities: leading or coordinating efforts that correspond to the secretary of homeland security's priorities ( eg , certain immigration or law - enforcement related issues ) , and self - initiated activities: opportunities to better harmonize policy and strategy or create additional efficiencies given plcy's ability to see across the department .

for example , plcy officials said that dhs observed an increase in e - commerce and small businesses shipping items via carriers other than the u.s .

postal service , thus exploiting a gap in dhs monitoring , which covers the u.s .

postal service and other traditional shipping entities .

plcy officials noted that dhs's interest in addressing e - commerce issues occurred just before opioids and other controlled substances were being mailed through small businesses and the u.s .

postal service .

as a result , plcy developed an e - commerce strategy for , among other things , the shipping of illegal items and how to provide information to u.s. customs and border protection before parcels are shipped to the united states from abroad .

in accordance with the ndaa , as plcy leads , conducts , and coordinates policy and strategy , it is to do so in a manner that promotes and ensures quality , consistency , and integration across dhs and applies risk - based analysis and planning to departmentwide strategic planning efforts .

the ndaa further provides that all component heads are to coordinate with plcy when establishing or modifying policies or strategic planning guidance to ensure consistency with dhs's policy priorities .

in addition to the roles plcy plays that are directly related to leading , conducting , and coordinating policy and strategy , the office is responsible for select operational functions .

for example , plcy is charged with operating the real id and visa waiver programs .

the ndaa also conferred responsibilities to plcy that had not been responsibilities of the dhs office of policy prior to the ndaa's enactment .

among other things , the ndaa charged plcy with responsibility for establishing standards of reliability and validity for statistical data collected and analyzed by the department , and ensuring the accuracy of metrics and statistical data provided to congress .

in conferring this responsibility , the act also transferred to plcy the maintenance of all immigration statistical information of the u.s. customs and border protection , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement , and u.s .

citizenship and immigration services .

plcy has established five performance goals: build departmental policy - making capacity , coordination , and foster the unity of effort , mature the office as a mission - oriented , component - focused organization that is responsive to dhs leadership , effectively engage and leverage stakeholders , enhance productivity and effectiveness of policy personnel through appropriate alignment of knowledge , skills , and abilities , and accountability , transparency , and leadership .

plcy officials stated that the office established the performance goals in fiscal year 2015 and they were still in effect as of fiscal year 2018 .

as previously discussed , dhs has eight operational components .

dhs also has six support components .

although each one has a distinct role to play in helping to secure the homeland , there are operational and support functions that cut across mission areas .

for example , nearly every operational component has , as part of its security operations , a need for screening , vetting , and credentialing procedures and risk - targeting mechanisms .

likewise , nearly all operational components have some form of international engagement , deploying staff abroad to help secure the homeland before threats reach u.s. borders .

finally , as shown in figure 2 , different aspects of broad mission areas fall under the purview of more than one dhs operational component .

plcy is responsible for coordinating three key dhs strategic efforts: the qhsr , the dhs strategic plan , and the resource planning guidance .

the qhsr is a comprehensive examination of the homeland security strategy of the nation that is to occur every 4 years and include recommendations regarding the long - term strategy and priorities for homeland security of the nation and guidance on the programs , assets , capabilities , budget , policies , and authorities of dhs .

the qhsr is to be conducted in consultation with the heads of other federal agencies , key dhs officials ( including the under secretary , plcy ) , and key officials from other relevant governmental and nongovernmental entities .

the dhs strategic plan describes how dhs can accomplish the missions it identifies in the qhsr report , identifies high - priority mission areas within dhs , and lays the foundation for dhs to accomplish its unity of effort initiative as well as various cross - agency priority goals in the strategic plan , such as cybersecurity .

the resource planning guidance describes dhs's annual resource allocation process in order to execute the missions and goals of the qhsr and dhs strategic plan .

the resource planning guidance contains guidance over a 5-year period and informs several forward - looking reports to congress , including the annual fiscal year congressional budget justification as well as the future years homeland security program report .

although plcy has effectively carried out key coordination functions at the senior level related to strategy , plcy's ability to lead and coordinate policy have been limited due to ambiguous roles and responsibilities and a lack of predictable , accountable , and repeatable procedures .

according to our analysis and interviews with operational components , plcy's efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies — a key organizational objective — have been effective in providing opportunities for all relevant stakeholders to learn about and contribute to departmentwide or crosscutting strategy development .

in this role , plcy routinely serves as the executive agent for the deputies management action group and the senior leaders council , which involve analytical and coordination support .

plcy also provides support for deputy - and principal - level decision making .

for example , the strategy and policy executive steering committee ( s&p esc ) meetings have been used to discuss components' implementation plans for crosscutting strategies , plcy's requests for information from components for an upcoming strategy , and updates on departmentwide strategic planning initiatives .

according to plcy and operational component officials , plcy also provides leadership for the resource planning guidance and winter studies , both of which help inform departmentwide resource decision - making .

for example , officials from one operational component stated that plcy's leadership of the resource planning guidance is a helpful practice for coordination and collaboration on departmentwide or crosscutting strategies .

the officials stated that plcy reaches out to ensure that the component is covering the secretary's priorities and this helps the component to ensure that its budget includes them .

furthermore , plcy develops and coordinates policy options and opinions for the secretary to present at the national security council and other white house - level meetings .

for example , plcy officials told us that , in light of allegations of russian involvement in using poisonous nerve agents on two civilians in great britain , plcy coordinated the collection of information to develop a policy recommendation for the secretary to present at a national security council meeting .

plcy has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop , update , or harmonize policy — also a key organizational objective — because it does not have clearly - defined roles , responsibilities , and mechanisms to implement these responsibilities in a predictable , repeatable , and accountable way .

standards for internal control in the federal government states that management should establish an organizational structure , assign responsibility , and delegate authority to achieve the entity's objectives .

as such , an organization's management should develop an organizational structure with an understanding of the overall responsibilities and assign these responsibilities to discrete units to enable the organization to operate in an efficient and effective manner .

an organization's management should also implement control activities through policies .

it is important that an organization's management document and define policies and communicate those policies and procedures to personnel , so they can implement control activities for their assigned responsibilities .

in addition , leading collaboration practices we have identified in our prior work include defining and articulating a common outcome , clarifying roles and responsibilities , and establishing mutually - reinforcing or joint strategies to enhance and sustain collaboration , such as the work that plcy and the components need to do together to ensure that departmentwide and crosscutting policy is effective for all relevant parties .

according to plcy officials , in general , plcy is responsible for leading the development of a policy when it crosses multiple components or if there is a national implication , including white house interest in the policy .

however , plcy officials acknowledged that this practice does not always make them the lead and there are no established criteria that define the circumstances under which plcy ( or another organizational unit ) should lead development of policies that cut across organizational boundaries .

plcy officials said the lead entity for a policy is often announced in an email from the secretary's office , on a case - by - case basis .

according to plcy officials , once components have been assigned responsibility for a policy , they have generally tended to retain it , and plcy may not have oversight for crosscutting policies that are maintained by operational components .

therefore , there is no established , coordinated system of oversight to periodically monitor the need for policy harmonization , revision , or rescission .

in the absence of clear roles and responsibilities , and processes and procedures to support them , plcy and officials in 5 of the 8 components have encountered challenges in coordinating with each other .

although plcy and most component officials we interviewed described overall positive experiences in coordinating with each other , we identified multiple instances of ( 1 ) confusion about which parties should lead and engage in policy efforts , ( 2 ) not engaging components at the right times , ( 3 ) incompatible expectations around timelines , and ( 4 ) uncertainty about plcy's role and the extent to which it can and should identify and drive policy in support of a more cohesive dhs .

confusion about who should lead and engage .

officials from one operational component told us that they were tasked with leading a departmentwide policy development effort they believed was outside their area of responsibility and expertise .

officials in another operational component stated that components sometimes end up coordinating among themselves , but that policy development could be more effective and efficient if plcy took the role of convener and facilitator to ensure the departmentwide perspective is present and all relevant stakeholders participate .

officials from a third component stated that they spent significant time and resources to develop a policy directly related to their component's mission .

as the component got ready to implement the policy , plcy became aware of it and asked the component to stop working on the policy , so plcy could develop a departmentwide policy .

according to component officials , while they were supportive of a departmentwide policy , plcy's timing delayed implementation of the policy the component had developed and wasted the resources it had invested .

moreover , officials from four operational components told us that sometimes counselors from outside plcy , such as the secretary's office , have led policy efforts that seem like they should be plcy's responsibility , which created more confusion about what plcy's ongoing role should be .

plcy officials agreed that , at times , it has been challenging to define plcy's role relative to counselors for the secretary , and acknowledged that clear guidance to define who is leading which types of policy development and coordination would be helpful .

not engaging components at the right times .

officials from 5 of 8 operational components told us that they had not always been engaged at the right times by plcy in departmentwide or crosscutting policies that affected their missions .

for example , officials from an operational component described a crosscutting policy that had significant implications for some of its key operational resources , but the component was not made aware of the policy until it was about to be presented at the white house .

officials from another component stated that they learned of a new policy after it was in place and had to find significant training and software resources to implement it even though they viewed the policy as unnecessary for their mission .

plcy officials stated that , while they intend to identify all components that should be involved in a policy , there are times when plcy is unaware a component is developing a policy that affects other components .

plcy officials said they will involve other components when plcy becomes aware that a component is developing such a policy .

plcy officials stated that it would be helpful to have a process and procedures for cross - component coordination on policies to help guide engagement regardless of who is developing the policy .

incompatible expectations around timelines .

officials at 4 of 8 operational components stated that short timelines from plcy to provide input and feedback can prevent plcy from obtaining thoughtful and complete information from components .

for example , officials from one component stated that plcy asked them to perform an analysis that would inform major , departmental decision - making and quickly provide the analysis .

component officials told us that they did not understand why plcy needed the analysis on such an accelerated timeline , which seemed inappropriate given the level of importance and purpose of the analysis .

officials from another component told us that plcy had not always provided enough time to provide thoughtful feedback ; therefore , component officials were not sure if plcy really wanted their feedback .

officials from a third component stated that sometimes plcy did not provide sufficient time for thoughtful input or feedback that had cleared the component's legal review , so component officials elected to miss plcy's deadline and provide late feedback .

plcy officials told us that , frequently , timelines are not within their control , a situation that some component officials also noted during our interviews with them .

however , plcy officials agreed that a documented , predictable , and repeatable process and procedures for policies may help ensure plcy provides sufficient comment time when in its control and may provide a basis to help negotiate timelines with dhs leadership in other situations .

plcy officials stated that , even with a documented process and procedures , there would still be circumstances when short timelines are unavoidable .

uncertainty about plcy's role in driving policy harmonization .

policy officials at 6 of 8 operational components told us that they were unsure or not aware of plcy's role in harmonizing policy across the department , and stated a desire for plcy to be more involved in harmonizing or enhancing departmentwide and crosscutting policy or for greater clarity about plcy's responsibility to play this role .

as previously discussed , plcy's policy and strategy efforts fall into four categories — statutory responsibilities , interagency efforts , secretary's priorities , and self - initiated activities ; these activities include efforts to better harmonize policies and strategies .

according to plcy officials , the category with the lowest priority is self - initiated activities .

plcy officials stated that plcy makes tradeoffs and rarely chooses to work on self - initiated projects over its other three categories of effort .

according to the officials , plcy's work on the other three higher - priority categories is sufficient to ensure that the office is effectively leading , conducting , and coordinating strategy and policy across the department .

given its organizational position and strategic priorities , plcy is uniquely situated to identify opportunities to better harmonize or enhance departmentwide and crosscutting policy , a role that is in line with its strategic priority to build departmental policymaking capacity and foster unity of effort .

in the absence of clear articulation of the department's expectations for plcy in this role , it is difficult for plcy and dhs leadership to make completely informed and deliberate decisions about the tradeoffs they make across any available resources .

in addition to statutory authority that plcy received in the ndaa , plcy officials stated that a separate , clear delegation of authority — a mechanism by which the secretary delegates responsibilities to other organizational units within dhs — is needed to help confront the ambiguous roles it has experienced in the past .

plcy officials stated that past efforts to finalize a delegation of authority have stalled during leadership changes and that the initiative has been a lower priority , in part , due to where plcy is in its maturation process and dhs is in its evolution into a more cohesive department under the unity of effort .

as of may 2018 , the effort had been revived , but it is not clear whether and when dhs will finalize it .

according to a senior official in the office of the under secretary for management , a delegation of authority is important for plcy .

he described the creation of a delegation of authority as a process that does more than simply delegate the secretary's authority .

he noted that defining plcy's roles and responsibilities in relation to other organizational units presents an opportunity to engage all relevant components and agree on appropriate roles .

he said that , earlier in the organizational life of the office of the under secretary for management , it went through a process like this , which has been vital in it being able to carry out its mission .

he said now that plcy has a deputy undersecretary in place , this is a good time to restart the process to develop the delegation of authority .

until the delegation or a similar process clearly and fully articulates plcy's roles and responsibilities , plcy and the operational components are likely to continue to experience limitations in collaboration on crosscutting and departmentwide policy .

plcy determines its workforce needs through the annual budget process , but systematic identification of workforce demand , capacity gaps , and strategies to address them could help ensure that plcy's workforce aligns with its and dhs's priorities and goals .

to determine its workforce needs each year , plcy officials told us that , as part of the annual budget cycle , they work with plcy staff and operational components to determine the scope of activities required for each plcy area of responsibility and the associated staffing needs .

plcy officials said there are three skill sets needed to carry out the office's responsibilities: policy analysis , social science analysis , and regional affairs analysis .

plcy officials explained that the office's priorities can change rapidly as events occur and the secretary's and administration's priorities shift .

therefore , according to plcy officials , their staffing model must be flexible .

they said that , rather than a defined system of full - time equivalents with set position types and levels , plcy officials start with their budget allotment and consider current and potential emerging needs to set position types and levels , which may fluctuate significantly from year to year .

in addition , plcy officials stated that plcy staff are primarily generalists and , given the versatility in skill sets of their workforce , plcy has a lot of flexibility to move staff around if there is an emerging need .

for example , if there is an emerging law enforcement issue that affects all law enforcement agencies , plcy may be tasked with developing a policy to ensure the issue is addressed quickly and that the resulting policy is harmonized across the department and with other law enforcement agencies , such as the department of justice .

while plcy completes some workforce planning activities as part of its annual budgeting process , plcy does not systematically address several aspects of the dhs workforce planning guide that may create more efficient operations and greater alignment with dhs priorities .

according to the dhs workforce planning guide , workforce planning is a process that ensures the right number of people with the right skills are in the right jobs at the right time for dhs to achieve the mission .

this process provides a framework to: align workforce planning to the department's mission and goals , predict , then assess how evolving missions , new processes , or environmental conditions may impact the way that work will be performed at dhs in the future , identify gaps in capacity , develop and implement strategies and action plans to address capacity and capability gaps , and continuously monitor the effectiveness of action plans and modify , as necessary .

the dhs workforce planning guide stipulates that an organization's management should not only lead and show support during the workforce planning process , but ensure alignment with the strategic direction of the agency .

moreover , standards for internal control in the federal government states that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives .

for example , management uses an entity's operational processes to make informed decisions and evaluate the entity's performance in achieving key agency objectives .

according to plcy officials , the current staffing paradigm involves shifting the office's staff when new and urgent issues arise from the secretary or white house , and adding these unexpected tasks to staff's existing responsibilities .

however , this means that tradeoffs are made , resulting in some priority items taking longer to address or not getting attention at all .

plcy officials stated that they have been caught off - guard at times by changes in demands placed on plcy and had to scramble to address the new needs .

additionally , plcy officials said they have a number of vacancies , which hamper the office's ability to meet certain aspects of its mission .

for example , plcy's office of cyber , infrastructure , and resilience was created in 2015 .

according to plcy officials , plcy has had some resources to address cyber issues , however , there has not been funding to staff this office and an assistant secretary has not been appointed to lead it .

therefore , plcy officials stated that plcy has not been able to address its responsibilities for infrastructure resilience .

similarly , plcy has limited capacity for risk analysis .

a provision of the ndaa provides that plcy is to: develop and coordinate strategic plans and long - term goals of the department with risk - based analysis and planning to improve operational mission effectiveness , including consultation with the secretary regarding the quadrennial homeland security review under section 707 [6 u.s.c .

§ 347] .

however , plcy officials acknowledged that their focus on identifying needs for risk analyses and conducting them has been limited , in part , because dhs disbanded the risk management office .

officials from one component told us that they contribute to a report that plcy coordinates , called homeland security national risk characteristics , which is prepared as a precursor to the dhs strategic plan .

plcy officials stated that , outside of these foundational documents and some risk - based analyses completed as part of specific policy development efforts , plcy does not have the capacity to complete any additional risk analysis activities .

although plcy officials said they conduct some analysis of potential demands as a starting point for how to allocate plcy's annual staffing budget , these efforts are largely informal and internal and have not resulted in a systematic analysis that provides plcy and dhs management with the information they need to understand the effects of resource tradeoffs .

also , plcy officials said they track accomplishments toward plcy's strategic priorities as part of a weekly meeting and report , however , officials acknowledged they do not analyze what role workforce decisions have played in achieving or not achieving strategic priorities .

moreover , although plcy officials stated that they have intermittent , in - person , informal communication about resource use , they have not used the principles outlined in the dhs workforce planning guide to systematically identify and communicate workforce demands , capacity gaps , and strategies to address workforce issues .

according to plcy officials , they have not conducted such analysis , in part , because the secretary's office has not requested it of them or the other dhs offices that are funded in the same part of the dhs budget .

regardless of whether the secretary expects workforce analysis as part of the budgeting process , the dhs workforce planning guide could be used within and outside of the budgeting process to help inform resource decision making throughout the year .

plcy officials stated that at the plcy deputy under secretary's initiative , they recently began a review of all relevant statutory authorities , which they will map against the current organizational structure and day - to - day operations .

the deputy under secretary plans to use the results of the review to enhance plcy's efficiency and effectiveness , and the results could serve as a foundation for a more holistic and systematic analysis of workforce demand , any capacity gaps , and strategies to address them .

employing workforce planning principles — in particular , systematic identification of workforce demand , capacity gaps , and strategies to address them — consistent with the dhs workforce planning guide could better position plcy to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions .

moreover , using the dhs guide would help plcy to systematically communicate information about any workforce gaps to dhs leadership , so there is transparency about how workforce tradeoffs affect plcy's ability to support dhs goals .

as discussed earlier , officials from plcy and dhs operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level , especially about strategy .

however , component officials identified opportunities for plcy to better connect at the staff level to identify and respond to emerging policy and strategy needs .

leading practices for collaboration that we have identified in our prior work state that it is important to ensure that all relevant participants have been included in a collaborative effort , and positive working relationships among participants from different agencies or offices can bridge organizational cultures .

these relationships build trust and foster communication , which facilitate collaboration .

also , as previously stated , plcy has mechanisms like the s&p esc to communicate and coordinate with operational components and other dhs stakeholders at the senior level ( eg , senior executive service officials ) .

however , plcy does not have a mechanism to effectively engage in routine communication and collaboration at the staff level ( eg , program and policy specialists working at operational components to oversee or implement policy and strategy functions ) .

specifically , officials with responsibility for policy and strategy at 6 of 8 operational components told us that they did not have regular contact with or know who to contact at plcy for questions about policies or strategies , or that the reason they knew who to contact was because of existing working relationships , not because of efforts plcy had undertaken to facilitate such contacts .

in addition , some component officials noted that , when they tried to use the plcy website to coordinate , they found it to be out of date and lacking sufficient information .

plcy officials acknowledged that the website needs improvement .

they stated that the office has developed improved content for the website , but does not have the necessary staff to update the website .

according to the officials , the needed staff should be hired soon and improved content should be on the website by the end of summer 2018 .

although officials at 5 of the 8 operational components we interviewed stated that the quality of plcy's coordination and collaboration has improved in the past 2 years or so , component officials offered several suggestions to enhance plcy's coordination and collaboration , especially at the staff level .

among these were: conduct routine information sharing meetings with staff - level officials who have policy and strategy responsibilities at each operational component , clearly articulate points of contact , their contact information , and their portfolios at plcy as well as at other policy and strategy stakeholders , ensure the plcy website is up - to - date with contact information for plcy and components that work in strategy and policy areas , and with relevant information about crosscutting strategy and policy initiatives underway , host a forum — such as an annual conference — to bring together policy and strategy officials from plcy and dhs components to share ideas and make contacts , and prepare a standard briefing for component officials with strategy and policy responsibilities to help ensure that staff at all levels understand what plcy does , how it works , and opportunities for engagement on emerging policy and strategy needs or identified harmonization opportunities .

for example , officials from one component told us that they would like plcy officials to have in - person meetings with component staff to discuss what plcy does , who to contact in plcy , where to find information about policies and strategies , and other relevant information to ensure a smooth working relationship between the component and plcy .

according to plcy officials , the office recognizes the value of creating mechanisms to connect staff , who work on policy and strategy at all levels in dhs .

plcy officials said they have historically done a better job in coordinating at the senior level , but are interested in expanding opportunities to connect other staff with policy and strategy responsibilities .

plcy officials stated that they are considering creating a working group structure that mirrors existing organizational mechanisms to coordinate at the senior level , but have not taken steps to do so .

routine collaboration among plcy , operational components , and other dhs offices at the staff level is important to ensure that plcy is able to carry out its functions under the ndaa , including the effective coordination of policies and strategies .

a positive working relationship among these stakeholders can build trust , foster communication , and facilitate collaboration .

such enhanced communication and collaboration across plcy and among component officials with policy and strategy responsibility could help the department more quickly and completely identify emerging , crosscutting strategy and policy needs and opportunities to enhance policy harmonization .

plcy's efforts to lead , conduct , and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting policies have sometimes been hampered by the lack of clearly - defined roles and responsibilities .

in addition , plcy does not have a consistent process and procedures for its strategy development and policymaking efforts .

without a delegation of authority or similar documentation from dhs leadership clearly articulating plcy's missions , roles , and responsibilities — along with defined processes and procedures to carry them out in a predictable and repeatable manner — there is continuing risk that confusion and uncertainty about plcy's authority , missions , roles , and responsibilities will limit its effectiveness .

plcy employs some workforce planning , but does not systematically apply key principles of the dhs workforce planning guide to help predict workforce demand , and identify any workforce gaps and design strategies to address them .

without this analysis , plcy faces limitations in ensuring that its workforce is aligned with its and dhs's priorities and goals .

moreover , the results of this analysis would better position plcy to communicate to dhs leadership any potential tradeoffs in workforce allocation that would affect plcy's ability to meet priorities and goals .

plcy could enhance its use of mechanisms for collaboration and communication with dhs stakeholders at the staff level .

implementation of additional mechanisms at the staff level for regular communication and coordination , including providing up - to - date information to stakeholders about the office , could help plcy and operational components to better connect in order to identify and address emerging policy and strategy needs .

we are making the following four recommendations to dhs: the secretary of homeland security should finalize a delegation of authority or similar document that clearly defines plcy's mission , roles , and responsibilities relative to dhs's operational and support components .

 ( recommendation 1 ) the secretary of homeland security should create corresponding processes and procedures to help implement the mission , roles , and responsibilities defined in the delegation of authority or similar document to help ensure predictability , repeatability , and accountability in departmentwide and crosscutting strategy and policy efforts .

 ( recommendation 2 ) the under secretary for strategy , policy , and plans should use the dhs workforce planning guide to help identify and analyze any gaps in plcy's workforce , design strategies to address any gaps , and communicate this information to dhs leadership .

 ( recommendation 3 ) the under secretary for strategy , policy , and plans should enhance the use of collaboration and communication mechanisms to connect with staff in the components with responsibilities for policy and strategy to better identify and address emerging needs .

 ( recommendation 4 ) .

we provided a draft of this report for review and comment to dhs .

dhs provided written comments , which are reproduced in appendix i. dhs also provided technical comments , which we incorporated , as appropriate .

dhs concurred with three of our recommendations and described actions planned to address them .

dhs did not concur with one recommendation .

specifically , dhs did not concur with our recommendation that plcy should use the dhs workforce planning guide to help identify and analyze any gaps in plcy's workforce , design strategies to address any gaps , and communicate this information to dhs leadership .

the letter described a number of actions , including actions that are also described in the report , which plcy takes to help ensure alignment of its staff with organizational needs .

in the letter , plcy officials pointed to the workforce activities plcy undertakes as part of the annual budgeting cycle .

we acknowledge that the actions described to predict upcoming priorities and resource needs as part of the annual budgeting cycle are in line with the dhs workforce planning principles .

however , as we noted , there are opportunities to apply the workforce planning principles outside the annual budgeting cycle to provide greater visibility and awareness of resource tradeoffs to management inside plcy and in the secretary's office .

in the letter , plcy officials made note of the dynamic and changing nature of its operational environment , stating that it often required them to shift resources and priorities on a more frequent or ad hoc basis than many organizations .

we acknowledged in the report that plcy's operating environment requires it to maintain flexibility in its staffing approach .

however , plcy has a number of important duties , including helping foster unity of effort throughout the department and helping to ensure the availability of risk information for departmental decision making , that require longer - term , sustained attention and strategic management .

during interviews , plcy officials acknowledged that striking a balance between these needs has been difficult and at times they have faced significant struggles .

the report describes some areas where , during the time we were conducting our work , it was clear that some tasks and functions , such as risk analyses , lacked the resources or focus necessary to ensure they received sustained institutional attention .

it is because of plcy's dynamic operating environment , coupled with the need for sustained institutional attention to other key responsibilities , that we recommended plcy undertake workforce planning activities that would help generate better information for plcy and dhs management to have full visibility and awareness of gaps and resource tradeoffs .

finally , the letter stated that because plcy is a very small and flat organization , it is able to identify capacity gaps and develop action plans without obtaining all of the data collected through each recommended element , worksheet , form , and template of the model proposed in the dhs workforce planning guide .

we acknowledge that it would be counterproductive for plcy to engage in data collection and analysis that are significantly more elaborate than its planning needs .

nevertheless , we continue to believe that plcy could use the principles more robustly , outside the annual budgeting process , to help ensure that it identifies and communicates the effect that resource tradeoffs have on its ability to accomplish its multifaceted mission .
