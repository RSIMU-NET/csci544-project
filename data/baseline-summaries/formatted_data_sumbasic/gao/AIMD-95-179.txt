this report responds to your request that we provide a descriptive overview of the federal budget account structure .

the need to better understand the budget account structure is prompted by recent congressional actions , such as the government performance and results act , and executive branch initiatives , such as the national performance review , which call for or suggest cross - cutting changes to budget accounts .

how many accounts are there ? .

what is the level of resources available in an account ? .

what is the primary focus of an account as created by the congress ? .

resource type: what type ( s ) of budget authority is available to an account ? .

what is the extent of resource restriction or earmarking within an account ? .

what are the purposes or areas of national need addressed by an account ? .

what is the responsible federal entity for an account ? .

subcommittee: which subcommittee acts on the resources in an account ? .

the first section of this report , “understanding the federal budget account structure,” describes the structure in terms of these eight dimensions .

the second section , “discerning patterns within the federal budget account structure,” constructs profiles and discusses relationships among the dimensions .

appendix i is a glossary of selected terms used in this report .

appendix ii contains summary figures relating account number and size , resource type , and fund type to the final three dimensions .

appendix iii presents figures ( 1 ) summarizing medians and ranges of account size by federal missions , federal organizations , and cognizant appropriations subcommittees and ( 2 ) relating federal missions , federal organizations , and appropriations subcommittees .

in appendix iv , we present details of our scope and methodology .

this is followed by a selected bibliography from our literature search .

federal budget accounts are a product of the needs and goals of many users and reflect the many roles which they have been asked to address .

the present budget account “structure” was not created as a single integrated framework but rather developed , for the most part , as separate budget accounts over time to respond to specific needs .

viewing these individually developed accounts collectively discloses not only the variety within the current structure but also its complexity .

our review of fiscal year 1995 budget accounts revealed a structure characterized by a concentration of budgetary resources in a few large accounts and a scattering of remaining resources among hundreds of other accounts ; a mix of account orientations with an emphasis on programs and processes , rather than objects of expense or organizations ; over 70 percent of total budgetary resources available in fiscal year 1995 from sources which did not require congressional approval in the current year ; and extensive use of general funds to provide most budgetary resources to most accounts , but with special and trust funds supporting about 30 percent of total resources and 20 percent of all accounts .

these observations vary significantly among federal missions , federal organizations , and appropriations subcommittees and help to illustrate the intricate network of relationships within the budget account structure .

as a result , cross - cutting initiatives that affect budget accounts will encounter in hundreds of accounts a fundamentally heterogeneous structure that serves many different needs and objectives .

nearly 50 years ago , the hoover commission examined the federal budget account structure and concluded , “the present appropriation structure underlying the budget is a patchwork affair evolved over a great many years and following no rational pattern.” “an item for which appropriations are made in any appropriation act and , for items not provided for in appropriation acts , ...means an item for which there is a designated budget account identification code number in the president's budget.” we began our analysis from this definition of an account .

however , within federal budgeting and financial management , operational definitions for the term “account” vary depending on the user and the purpose to be served .

for example , congressional appropriators establish budget accounts to facilitate congressional allocation and oversight responsibilities .

the president's budget presentation generally reflects this structure but may consolidate separate items into a single account.agency officials use these budget account structures to report to the congress and the office of management and budget ( omb ) , but they often rely on more detailed account structures — such as standard general ledger accounts which integrate proprietary and budgetary accounting , internal budgetary allotment schedules , or project and activity plans maintained by program managers — to monitor expenditures and performance and for other management needs .

once defined , accounts may be quantified in various ways depending on the user and the purpose to be served .

a wide variety of budgetary information and subsidiary classifications are available to meet the many needs of different users .

for example , users interested in relative priorities within the annual budget process might concentrate on budget authority ; those interested in the approaches used by government to address its needs might look to obligations ; and those interested in deficits and how much the government ultimately spends might emphasize outlays .

each perspective would produce a different , but equally valid , universe of budget accounts .

for this report , we have used budgetary resources as reported in the president's budget presentation to define and measure the universe of accounts .

budgetary resources are equivalent to all available budget authority — appropriations , borrowing and contract authority , reappropriations , and offsetting collections from the public and other federal organizations , net of transferred authority and statutory limitations .

this approach captures a very large universe by including all accounts with budgetary resources available for obligation , but it can be confusing when compared to the outlays occurring in a given fiscal year .

because budgetary resources include current and permanent authority as well as resources available from offsetting collections and from prior years , they may vary significantly from outlays .

this was the case for the fiscal year 1995 estimate , as reported in the president's fiscal year 1996 budget , which projected budgetary resources of $2.5 trillion and net outlays of $1.5 trillion .

lastly , it might be inferred that discussing budget accounts as a structure , rather than as separate and independent decisions as indicated by the 1985 act quoted above , suggests that there is or should be a set of coherent rules and criteria .

this is not our intention .

in this report , we examine budget accounts collectively for two reasons .

first , the concept of a budget account structure is accepted among budget practitioners and academics and allows for succinct references to an ever - changing and complex environment .

second , analyses which describe the budget account structure in terms of the characteristics and patterns of its constituent parts — the separate accounts — can provide rich insights into the federal budget process and are necessary to the consideration of cross - cutting proposals .

for example , the following recent congressional actions and administration initiatives call for or suggest certain cross - cutting changes to budget accounts .

the government performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993 was enacted to enhance program management , public accountability , and congressional decision - making by establishing a process to set strategic and annual program goals and to measure accomplishments .

by the fall of 1997 , executive organizations are required to submit to omb an annual performance plan which establishes a target level of performance for each project or activity listed in the “program by activities” section of each budget account presentation .

beginning with the february 1998 submission of the fiscal year 1999 budget , the president is required to transmit to the congress a “federal government performance plan for the overall budget.” the national performance review ( npr ) , under the leadership of the vice president , is an executive branch management reform effort intended to make the government “work better and cost less.” among hundreds of npr recommendations , generally intended to emphasize results and enhance managerial flexibility , were several dealing with “mission - driven , results - oriented budgeting.” some of the most significant recommendations concerning the budget account structure were proposals to ( 1 ) restructure budget accounts to reduce over - itemization and to align them with programs , ( 2 ) budget and manage on the basis of operating costs , and ( 3 ) identify accounts that should be converted to multi - year or no - year status .

the federal accounting standards advisory board ( fasab ) was created to consider and recommend accounting principles for the federal government .

recently , fasab has proposed cost accounting standards,which ( 1 ) focus on “responsibility segments,” defined as components associated with a specific mission , conducting a major activity , or producing one or more related products and services and ( 2 ) capture , for responsibility segments , “full costs,” defined as the costs of resources consumed directly or indirectly plus the costs of identifiable supporting services .

restructuring budget accounts to align with programs and outputs could be one outgrowth from budgetary and financial accounting that tracks entitywide expenditures and expenses .

a persistent pattern permeating the budget account structure is the unequal distribution of budgetary resources across accounts .

when the number and size of accounts are compared , an inverse relationship is revealed .

figure 1 displays this “bookend” relationship .

as figure 1 shows , nearly 80 percent of the federal government's resources are clustered in less than 5 percent of budget accounts ( 47 out of 1,303 ) .

conversely , 85 percent of all budget accounts contain about 6 percent of the federal government's total budgetary resources ( $138.8 billion out of total budgetary resources of $2.5 trillion ) .

collectively in fiscal year 1995 , there are 199 accounts with total budgetary resources over $1 billion and 162 accounts with budgetary resources of less than $1 million .

table 4 on page 17 more fully depicts the largest and smallest accounts .

a similar pattern of inequality emerges when comparing accounts and budgetary resources across federal missions , organizations , and appropriations subcommittees .

the three missions with the fewest number of accounts — social security , net interest , and medicare — are among the largest in terms of available 1995 budgetary resources .

consistent with the generally inverse relationship between accounts and budgetary resources , the missions with the most accounts — general government and natural resources and environment — have collectively only about 4 percent of total budgetary resources .

the departments of commerce and of health and human services ( hhs ) have the same number of accounts but vastly different amounts of budgetary resources — $6.7 billion and $383.8 billion , respectively .

conversely , although the departments of defense and of the treasury have comparable resource levels — $444.1 billion and $418.7 billion , respectively — defense has more than twice the number of accounts .

two appropriations subcommittees — interior and labor , health and human services , education , and related agencies — appropriate to similar numbers of accounts but provide widely different resource levels ( $15.0 billion and $260.6 billion , respectively ) .

the subcommittee concerned with the departments of commerce , justice , and state has the most accounts — almost 17 percent of the accounts which the appropriations subcommittees acted on in 1995 — but appropriated only about 4 percent of 1995 budgetary resources .

in establishing a budget account , the congress articulates its interests , which in turn define the account's orientation .

the current budget account structure displays a mix of orientations , reflecting both the 200 years of federal budget development and varying congressional interests .

we reviewed the fiscal year 1995 accounts of three judgmentally selected organizations — the departments of energy ( doe ) , hhs , and treasury — and found that these accounts appear to emphasize program and process orientations to a greater extent than objects and organizations .

within these three organizations , program and process accounts represented 60 percent of accounts and 55 percent of total budgetary resources .

each of the four orientations used in this report — object , organization , process , and program — reflects a specific focus or interest of the congress .

an object orientation emphasizes the items of expense , while an organization orientation focuses on the responsible governmental unit .

in effect , the former stresses control of spending on an item - by - item basis ; the latter accentuates accountability .

accounts with a process orientation concentrate on the specific operations or approaches underlying federal activities , while those with a program orientation focus on the missions and objectives of governmental units .

object , organization , process , and program orientations are found throughout the federal budget account structure .

each account generally will have a predominant orientation but may have characteristics of other orientations .

thus , assigning an account to a specific orientation reflects a judgment based on interpretations of an account's statutory language and obligation patterns .

table 1 presents examples of account orientations from doe , hhs , and treasury .

table 2 presents the results of our assessments of the account orientations for doe , hhs , and treasury , showing the percentage of accounts and budgetary resources for each orientation .

table 2 shows that more than half of the accounts in each of the three organizations have a program or process orientation .

fifty percent or more of doe's and hhs' accounts had a program orientation , and these accounts held most of their budgetary resources .

a total of 42 percent of treasury's accounts were oriented to process , but 82 percent of its resources were in object accounts , principally due to its large interest on the public debt account .

excluding this account changes the distribution of resources to 10 percent object , 1 percent organization , 60 percent process , and 28 percent program .

accounts with a program orientation do not necessarily capture all related program costs .

for example , the costs of providing medicare are spread among at least three accounts with different orientations: federal hospital insurance trust fund ( program orientation ) , federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund ( program orientation ) , and program management ( object orientation ) .

other programs separate accounts for salaries and expenses from other program expenditure accounts .

conversely , some accounts include the costs of a number of programs and activities within a single account .

for example , the hhs' children and families services programs account includes head start and many other social service and community services programs , while doe's economic regulation account captures the costs of both the economic regulatory administration and the office of hearings and appeals .

one of the more informative ways to characterize an account is by its resource and fund types .

these closely related dimensions illustrate the extent to which an account relies on current year authority , as opposed to other permanent or available types of funding , and the degree of earmarking or restriction associated with receipts available to an account .

resource type indicates when and how an account received resources available for a particular fiscal year .

we identified and analyzed four resource types: resources received in prior years , current authority , permanent authority , and offsetting collections .

fund type refers to the extent of designation or restriction of the receipts associated with an account .

we analyzed five fund types: general funds , intragovernmental revolving funds , public enterprise funds , special funds , and trust funds.both resource and fund types are defined in the glossary in appendix i .

table 3 summarizes these characteristics in terms of the number of accounts and amount of budgetary resources for fiscal year 1995 .

as shown in table 3 , permanent authority , the resource type associated with the fewest accounts , provides nearly half of the budgetary resources available in fiscal year 1995 .

conversely , prior year authority , the most common resource type among accounts , provides the fewest budgetary resources ( 12.5 percent ) .

over one - third of fiscal year 1995 budget accounts have access to offsetting collections .

combining offsetting collections with prior year funding and permanent authority means that approximately 70 percent of total budgetary resources ( about $1.76 trillion out of $2.47 trillion ) were available for obligation without further action by the congress in fiscal year 1995 .

within fund types , general funds comprise about two - thirds of all accounts and about 55 percent of available budgetary resources .

about 22 percent of accounts and 31 percent of available resources involve designated or restricted receipts in trust and special funds .

a fund type generally aligns with a specific resource type .

current authority provides more than half of the resources in general fund accounts .

permanent authority provides over 80 percent of the resources to trust fund accounts and almost 50 percent of resources to special fund accounts .

offsetting collections provide 89 percent of the funding to intragovernmental revolving funds and 54 percent of the resources to public enterprise funds .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.1 on page 34. ) .

again , interesting and variable patterns emerge when resource type and fund type are applied to federal missions , organizations , and appropriations subcommittees .

the figures in appendix ii present detailed information on these patterns .

the following are some of the observations that can be drawn from that information .

the federal missions used in this report correspond to the 18 omb budget function classifications described in appendix i .

except for net interest and medicare , the missions have all types of available budgetary resources .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.2 on page 36. ) .

permanent authority provides nearly all the budgetary resources for net interest and social security and is the dominant resource type for medicare ( 83 percent ) .

however , this resource type provides less than 10 percent of available budgetary resources for 8 other missions .

seven missions ( general science , space , and technology ; education , training , employment , and social services ; administration of justice ; veterans benefits and services ; natural resources and environment ; national defense ; and health ) received more than 50 percent of their available resources from current authority , while 6 missions had less than 20 percent of their available resources in current authority .

international affairs and community and regional development have the greatest share of their resources provided through prior year funding ( 63 percent and 37 percent respectively ) , but more than half of the mission areas receive less than 13 percent of their budgetary resources from this source .

offsetting collections are significant only to commerce and housing credit ( 62 percent ) , energy ( 55 percent ) , and agriculture ( 43 percent ) .

while virtually all missions have general fund and trust fund accounts , more than three - fourths have special , public enterprise , or intragovernmental fund types .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.5 on page 44. ) .

twelve of the 18 missions receive 50 percent or more of available resources from the general fund .

three missions — net interest ; general science , space , and technology ; and education , training , employment , and social services — are virtually fully funded through the general fund .

conversely , 2 missions — social security and commerce and housing credit — receive less than 5 percent of their available resources from the general fund .

trust funds provide the dominant share of budgetary resources for 3 missions — social security ( 99 percent ) , medicare ( 81 percent ) and transportation ( 71 percent ) — but represent 1 percent or less of budgetary resources in 8 other missions .

public enterprise funds are the most significant source of budgetary resources for 3 missions — commerce and housing credit ( 95 percent of budgetary resources in 30 percent of accounts ) , agriculture ( 80 percent of budgetary resources in 19 percent of accounts ) , and energy ( 55 percent of resources in 15 percent of accounts ) .

however , public enterprise funds provide less than 5 percent of the budgetary resources for 12 other missions .

only the general government mission has a significant amount of its budgetary resources ( 41 percent ) provided by intragovernmental revolving funds ; 13 missions receive less than 1 percent of their resources from these funds .

only 1 mission — natural resources and environment — has a sizeable number of special fund accounts ( 24 percent ) , but these accounts amount to only 6 percent of its budgetary resources .

for this report , we considered all federal government entities that received budgetary resources in fiscal year 1995 .

for presentation purposes , the federal organizations shown in our analyses include ( 1 ) all departments and agencies separately displayed in the president's budget , ( 2 ) the legislative and judicial branches , ( 3 ) the executive office of , and funds appropriated to , the president , and ( 4 ) the following independent agencies: the export - import bank of the united states , the federal deposit insurance corporation , the federal emergency management agency , the national science foundation , the postal service , the railroad retirement board , the resolution trust corporation , the smithsonian institution , and the united states information agency .

in our analyses , major organizations include all departments and the environmental protection agency .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.6 on page 46 and appendix iii , figure iii.6 on page 57 for federal organizations shown in our analyses and appendix iv for a description of how these organizations were selected. ) .

permanent authority provides more than half of available budgetary resources for 5 organizations: the social security administration ( 93 percent ) , treasury ( 86 percent ) , hhs ( 56 percent ) , the railroad retirement board ( 54 percent ) , and labor ( 51 percent ) .

however , about two - thirds of the organizations received less than 10 percent of their available budgetary resources from permanent authority .

for many federal organizations — including hhs ; the departments of housing and urban development ( hud ) , labor , the interior , the treasury , and transportation ; the general services administration ( gsa ) ; and the office of personnel management ( opm ) — current authority is less than half of total available budgetary resources .

none of the major organizations has more than 80 percent of available budgetary resources stemming from current authority .

offsetting collections provided between 10 percent and 24 percent of available resources for 9 of 15 major organizations: the department of defense ( dod ) , energy , commerce , agriculture , hud , justice , labor , state , and the interior .

five other organizations had more than 50 percent of budgetary resources in collections — the postal service , the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) , gsa , the resolution trust corporation ( rtc ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) .

resources from prior year authority comprise 13 percent of all budgetary resources to federal organizations ; however , they are a significant percentage of resources for only one major organization , hud ( 49 percent ) .

although general funds are the principal fund type for most federal organizations , there are some notable exceptions .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.6 on page 46. ) .

trust funds are the dominant fund type in the social security administration ( 90 percent of budgetary resources ) , the railroad retirement board ( 87 percent ) , opm ( 75 percent ) , and the departments of transportation ( 74 percent ) and labor ( 53 percent ) .

however , trust funds provided less than 10 percent of the budgetary resources to more than two - thirds of the organizations .

public enterprise funds are dominant for tva , the federal deposit insurance corporation , rtc , and the postal service ( all about 100 percent ) , but about one - third of the organizations did not receive any budgetary resources from these funds .

intragovernmental revolving funds are a significant fund type only for gsa ( 98 percent ) ; about half of the organizations did not receive resources from this fund type .

special funds provided less than 1 percent of budgetary resources to federal organizations but were about 17 percent of the budgetary resources of both the interior and the legislative branch .

the budget accounts acted on by appropriations subcommittees represent a smaller universe than the 1,303 accounts with $2.5 trillion in available budgetary resources that we analyzed to this point .

in fiscal year 1995 , appropriations subcommittees provided $903 billion in available budgetary resources to 860 accounts .

this smaller universe of accounts and resources results from excluding ( 1 ) resources provided by authorizing committees and ( 2 ) resources available from prior years .

current authority is provided exclusively through the appropriations process .

not surprisingly , current authority was the principal budgetary resource among the appropriations subcommittees , comprising almost 80 percent of budgetary resources appropriated .

permanent authority provides more than 10 percent of resources for only one subcommittee — the labor , health and human services , education and related agencies subcommittee .

offsetting collections are associated with 39 percent of subcommittee accounts and provide 15 percent of budgetary resources .

the subcommittees in which offsetting collections represent a larger share of resources are defense ( 29 percent ) ; transportation and related agencies ( 27 percent ) ; treasury , postal service , and general government ( 26 percent ) ; military construction ( 20 percent ) ; and energy and water development ( 19 percent ) .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.4 on page 42. ) .

similarly , budget accounts acted on by appropriations subcommittees are largely associated with the general fund .

for example , 96 percent or more of budgetary resources come from general funds for all subcommittees except the following: energy and water development ( 89 percent general funds ) ; defense ( 78 percent general fund , 22 percent intragovernmental revolving treasury , postal service and general government ( 76 percent general funds , 24 percent intragovernmental revolving funds ) ; and transportation and related agencies ( 69 percent general funds , 26 percent trust funds ) .

overall , less than 1 percent of all subcommittee resources were appropriated to accounts with special funds and public enterprise funds .

 ( see appendix ii , figure ii.7 on page 50. ) .

as the preceding discussion has shown , each dimension or characteristic can provide some insight into the federal budget account structure .

the following discussion highlights some of the patterns which can be detected when one or more of the variables is mapped against the others .

however , this represents only a preliminary and high - order analysis .

each dimension discussed in this report also could be analyzed at the individual budget account level .

this kind of detailed analysis would be needed to address specific questions or to comment on cross - cutting proposals .

as discussed earlier , the account structure is comprised of a few very large accounts and many very small accounts ( see figure 1 ) .

this raises the question of whether the largest and smallest accounts have different characteristics .

table 4 helps to answer this question .

it separates accounts into two groups — “large,” which we have defined arbitrarily as containing over $1 billion , and “small,” which we have defined arbitrarily as containing less than $1 million .

while no dominant order or design emerges , tendencies can be discerned .

although the number of accounts with budgetary resources over $1 billion and under $1 million is roughly similar , over 94 percent of all budgetary resources are concentrated in the accounts over $1 billion .

for the 361 accounts in these two categories , each of the four orientations was found in the group of accounts over $1 billion and in the group of accounts under $1 million .

however , accounts over $1 billion are oriented to programs more often than accounts under $1 million , which emphasize processes .

accounts under $1 million are more likely to be trust funds and less likely to receive current authority and offsetting collections than accounts over $1 billion .

accounts over $1 billion are more likely than accounts under $1 million to be general funds and to receive current authority and offsetting collections .

the preceding analysis helps to explain a budget account structure marked by a wide and unequal distribution of accounts by size .

analyzing median account sizes — the budgetary resources level at which half the accounts in a particular dimension are above and half are below — is another method to deal with this persistent pattern .

the median identifies representative accounts because it is unaffected by a few extremely large or small values .

in table 4 , the large accounts have a median of $3.2 billion , while the small accounts' median is $206,000 .

figures iii.1 , iii.2 , and iii.3 on pages 52 , 53 , and 54 in appendix iii present detailed information about account medians , the total number of accounts , and the ranges of budgetary resources for missions , organizations , and appropriations subcommittees .

the following are some of the more interesting patterns shown in these figures .

the medicare , social security , and net interest missions have the largest medians and the fewest accounts .

general government and community and regional development — missions with more diverse and numerous accounts — have the smallest medians .

five federal organizations ( the social security administration , rtc , tva , opm , and the federal deposit insurance corporation ) have comparatively large account medians ; the legislative branch has the smallest account median .

the defense appropriations subcommittee has the largest median account size , while the legislative branch subcommittee has the smallest .

organizations with similar account medians can have quite different profiles .

the department of justice ( doj ) and hud have roughly equal median account sizes ( about $135 million ) .

doj has $18.8 billion in budgetary resources , with 10 percent of its accounts over $1 billion , and it has no public enterprise funds .

in contrast , hud has resources of $75.9 billion , with 20 percent of its accounts over $1 billion , and about 25 percent of its accounts are public enterprise funds .

there also are some similarities .

both organizations are reviewed by one appropriations subcommittee and implement programs in about the same number of missions .

median account size also varies by fund type .

 ( see appendix iii , figure iii.4 on page 55. ) .

the median of intragovernmental revolving funds is three times that of public enterprise funds — the next largest median — due to large revolving funds in dod and gsa .

although the medians for public enterprise and general funds are similar , there are 116 public enterprise funds and 856 general funds .

trust funds have the smallest median , despite the existence of some very large trust funds such as social security , medicare , and highways .

finally , combining the dimensions discussed in this report into an overall matrix discloses the rich and complex relationships within the budget account structure .

figure 2 shows the intersections between the descriptive characteristics of federal missions , federal organizations , and cognizant appropriations subcommittees .

it visually presents another aspect of the complex setting that would be encountered by any cross - cutting proposals affecting the budget account structure .

the following are some of the overall patterns displayed in figure 2 which follows , as well as in figures iii.5 , iii.6 , and iii.7 on pages 56 , 57 , and 58 of appendix iii .

three missions are concentrated in one subcommittee each , while eight missions are addressed by five or more subcommittees .

three missions are concentrated in one organization each , while 10 missions are carried out by five or more organizations .

seven major federal organizations are considered by one appropriations subcommittee each and six others are considered by two subcommittees .

five subcommittees review parts of dod and hhs .

two subcommittees appropriate to more than 10 federal organizations and two others address 8 and 7 federal organizations , respectively .

five subcommittees deal with 2 or fewer federal organizations .

the descriptive overview discussed in this report represents only a first order of analysis .

as proposals suggesting across - the - board changes to the budget account structure are generated , more detailed analyses , keyed to the specific proposals , will be necessary .

however , this preliminary work demonstrates both the extent of analysis which can be performed and its potential utility .

major contributors to this report are listed in appendix v .

the federal missions listed in this report are defined by omb's budget function classification system , in which all accounts are assigned to one or more budget functions that generally indicate broad areas of national need .

the following are descriptions of the budget functions used in this report .

for a more complete description , see appendix ii in a glossary of terms used in the federal budget process ( exposure draft ) ( gao / afmd - 2.1.1 , jan. 1993 ) .

programs to provide judicial services , police protection , law enforcement ( including civil rights ) , rehabilitation and incarceration of criminals , and the general maintenance of domestic order .

promoting the economic stability of agriculture and the nation's capability to maintain and increase agricultural production .

promotion and regulation of commerce and the housing credit and deposit insurance industries , which pertain to collection and dissemination of social and economic data ( unless they are an integral part of another function , such as health ) ; general purpose subsidies to business , including credit subsidies to the housing industry ; and the postal service fund and general fund subsidies of that fund .

development of physical facilities or financial infrastructures designed to promote viable community economies .

promoting the extension of knowledge and skills , enhancing employment and employment opportunities , protecting workplace standards , and providing services to the needy .

promoting an adequate supply and appropriate use of energy to serve the needs of the economy .

general overhead cost of the federal government , including legislative and executive activities ; provision of central fiscal , personnel , and property activities ; and provision of services that cannot reasonably be classified in any other major function .

budget resources allocated to science and research activities of the federal government that are not an integral part of the programs conducted under any other function .

programs other than medicare whose basic purpose is to promote physical and mental health , including the prevention of illness and accidents .

support payments ( including associated administrative expenses ) to persons for whom no current service is rendered .

included are retirement , disability , unemployment , welfare , and similar programs , except for social security and income security for veterans , which are in other functions .

maintaining peaceful relations , commerce , and travel between the united states and the rest of the world and promoting international security and economic development abroad .

federal hospital insurance and federal supplementary medical insurance , along with general fund subsidies of these funds and associated offsetting receipts .

common defense and security of the united states , including raising , equipping , and maintaining of armed forces ; development and utilization of weapons systems ; direct compensation and benefits paid to active military and civilian personnel ; defense research , development , testing , and evaluation ; and procurement , construction , stockpiling , and other activities undertaken to directly foster national security .

developing , managing , and maintaining the nation's natural resources and environment .

transactions which directly give rise to interest payments or income ( lending ) and the general short fall or excess of outgo over income arising out of fiscal , monetary , and other policy considerations and leading to the creation of interest - bearing debt instruments ( normally the public debt ) .

federal old age and survivors and disability insurance trust funds , along with general fund subsidies of these funds and associated offsetting collections .

providing for the transportation of the general public and / or its property , regardless of whether local or national and regardless of the particular mode of transportation .

included are construction of facilities ; purchase of equipment ; research , testing , and evaluation ; provision of communications related to transportation ; operating subsidies for transportation facilities and industries ; and regulatory activities directed specifically toward the transportation industry rather than toward business .

programs providing benefits and services , the eligibility for which is related to prior military service , but the financing of which is not an integral part of the costs of national defense .

the extent of restriction or earmarking within accounts .

the five fund types discussed in this report follow .

accounts containing resources to be expended for the general support of the federal government .

accounts similar to public enterprise funds except that their governmental receipts primarily come from other government agencies and accounts .

accounts authorized by law to be credited with offsetting collections , primarily from the public , that are generated by and earmarked to finance a continuing cycle of business - type operations .

accounts whose resources are earmarked by law for specific purposes .

accounts designated by law as “trust funds” and earmarked for specific purposes and programs according to the terms of a trust agreement or a statute .

the focus of the congress in creating an account .

the four orientations discussed in this report follow .

focus on the specific items — the objects of expenditure — needed to operate a governmental unit .

examples are accounts containing expenses for salaries or equipment .

the predominant goal expressed through an object orientation is to control spending .

focus on a specific governmental unit .

this account orientation emphasizes the accountability of , rather than control over , the organization receiving the budgetary resources — that is , from a focus on objects to a focus on stewardship .

focus on the operations , approaches , and activities underlying federal programs , reflecting congressional interest in those processes .

examples include accounts for working capital funds or inspection services .

focus on the missions and objectives of governmental units , reflecting congressional attention to the purpose , program , or activity of government .

examples of such accounts include the fiscal year 1995 appropriations to the national aeronautics and space administration for human space flight and for science , aeronautics and technology — accounts which emphasize the purpose and major programs of the organization .

these accounts replaced accounts for construction of facilities and for research and development , which emphasized activities and processes .

the source of funding for accounts .

 - - four missions received 70 percent of funds available from prior years .

 - - three missions received 63 percent of current authority .

 - - four missions received 89 percent of permanent authority .

 - - two missions received 63 percent of offsetting collections .

all but four missions have authority available from prior years in more than half of their accounts .

however , prior - year funding provides significant resources to only one mission , international affairs .

permanent authority is a significant source of funds for only three missions , medicare , net interest , and social security .

less than 35 percent of accounts in other missions have available permanent authority .

offsetting collections are found in over half of the accounts of only four missions: commerce and housing credit , health , national defense , and veterans benefits and services .

 - - the departments of defense and health and human services have over 50 percent of current authority .

 - - the departments of health and human services , the treasury , and the social security administration have over 80 - - the department of defense receives over one - third of all offsetting collections .

however , every major organization receives funding from all sources .

resources available from prior years are found in nearly every organization .

with the exception of the postal service , over 40 percent of every organization's accounts have some funding available from previous years .

however , these resources provide more than half of funding for only three organizations .

permanent authority is not a significant source of funding for most organizations .

only nine organizations receive more than 20 percent of their resources in permanent authority .

offsetting collections are not a significant source of funding for most agencies .

however , five agencies receive more than half their funding through business - type transactions with either the public or other government entities .

only one subcommittee provides access to significant amounts of permanent authority .

 - - 18 percent of budget authority from the labor , health and human services , education and related agencies subcommittee is permanent .

national defense general science , space and technology veterans benefits and services commerce and housing credit education , training , employment , and social services transportation natural resources and environment community and regional development general government account medians by mission range widely .

the largest median is almost 7,000 times larger than the smallest .

each of the three missions with the highest medians has a narrow focus compared to other missions .

national aeronautics and space administration small business administration department of justice department of housing and urban development executive office of the president / funds appropriated to the president general services administration the judiciary medians of federal organizations are distributed into two groups .

the five largest medians range from $32 billion to $3 billion ; then there is a gap of $3 billion , and the account medians decline steadily .

labor , health and human services , education and related agencies veterans affairs , hud and independent agencies commerce , justice , state , judiciary and related agencies treasury , postal service and general government negative values indicate largest net resource reductions made by appropriations subcommittees .

the budget accounts associated with appropriations subcommittees represent a smaller universe than the 1,303 accounts with $2.5 trillion in resources used in other analyses in this report .

the median account in the defense appropriations subcommittee is larger than those in other subcommittees - - over six times that of the labor , health and human services , education and related agencies subcommittee and over 40 times larger than that of the treasury , postal service and general government subcommittee .

account with least resources $120 the median of intragovernmental revolving funds is three times greater than the next largest median , public enterprise funds , due to large intragovernmental revolving funds in the department of defense and the general services administration .

federal mission administration of justice community and regional development education , training , employment and social services general science , space and technology net interest is excluded from this analysis because it is not affected by appropriations subcommittees .

the "number of federal organizations" column counts the executive office of the president / funds appropriated to the president , the legislative branch , and the judiciary , as well as independent agencies not separately listed in figure iii.6 , as single entities .

this column excludes federal mission / organization relationships defined by authorizing committees .

most missions are performed by several organizations and funded by several subcommittees .

 - - over half of missions are performed by at least five organizations .

 - - over half of missions are funded by four or more subcommittees .

the accounts of most organizations are reviewed by only one or two subcommittees .

for major organizations , subcommittees generally fund the performance of three or more missions .

this column also excludes federal mission / organization relationships defined by authorizing committees .

most appropriations subcommittees fund multiple missions and organizations .

however , a few fund a single mission or organization .

 - - the defense , district of columbia , foreign assistance , and military construction subcommittees fund only one mission each .

 - - the district of columbia , legislative branch , and military construction subcommittees fund only one organization each .

the account - level data that formed the basis for this report were extracted from automated information collected and maintained by the office of management and budget ( omb ) .

as part of its annual process to develop the president's budget , omb uses its max budget system to collect a wide variety of information from all branches of government , from executive departments and organizations , and from independent agencies .

we obtained max data for the fiscal year 1996 budget , which included the current year 1995 estimates used in this report .

although we did not independently verify the extracted data for each budget account , we reconciled total budget authority and certain data from a judgmentally selected subset of accounts to the published budget of the u.s. government , fiscal year 1996 — appendix .

to define a universe of budget accounts , we extracted current year 1995 estimates of gross budgetary resources from the 1996 budget data .

gross budgetary resources are equivalent to gross budget authority given in the current year and available for obligation from prior years , net of transfers out , enacted rescissions , and statutory limitations on the use of authority.any regular account reporting such resources was extracted and compiled into a separate database we used for this project .

we verified our approach with omb to ensure that we were accurately identifying and collecting budgetary data consistent with the concept of gross budgetary resources .

we chose gross budgetary resources as the operational definition of a budget account for two reasons .

first , it is a concept that fulfills a wide variety of federal budget needs , from congressional oversight and appropriations to program management .

second , this definition ensured the largest possible universe of accounts with available budget authority for our study .

in effect , this approach caused a selection of all budget accounts which had available and enacted spending authority and thus could be the source of federal commitments ( or obligations ) during fiscal year 1995 .

budget authority is heterogeneous in nature .

it is provided in many different forms , covers many different time periods , and reflects congressional expectations ranging from indefinite authority that may never be used ( such as borrowing authority ) to definite authority which generally is expected to be outlayed in the current year ( such as current appropriations ) .

as a result , it is not additive , either across programs or organizations for a specific year or across a series of years for one program or organization .

however , even with this qualification , we have aggregated budgetary resources in this report , as omb does in its annual historical tables .

just as omb recognizes the need for historical data on this subject , we recognize a comparable need for current data to express the totality of current obligational authority .

for each account reporting gross budgetary resources , we extracted a variety of information from the omb max system .

to determine the federal organization , we extracted the agency code for each account .

in the analyses contained in this report , we identify the major branches and organizations that are separately presented in the president's budget .

other entities listed as “other independent agencies” in the budget are separately identified in specific analyses in this report when the entity represents a significant number of accounts and / or budgetary resources .

thus , the actual federal organizations listed in analyses based on appropriations subcommittees will differ slightly from those used in other analyses .

to determine the congressional decision - making structure , we extracted the appropriations bill originating subcommittee code for each account .

the max system indicates both the spending jurisdiction ( appropriations or authorizing committee ) and the specific appropriations subcommittee associated with each authority action for each account .

for analyses in which appropriations subcommittee was a variable , only accounts ( and resources within those accounts ) for which a specific appropriations subcommittee took action are included .

in addition , because the max system does not indicate the appropriations subcommittee associated with budgetary resources available from prior years , analyses involving appropriations subcommittees and resource types exclude any budgetary resources available from prior years .

therefore , the universe of accounts and budgetary resources for analyses involving appropriations subcommittees is smaller than the universe used in the remainder of this report .

to comment on the mission ( s ) addressed by the budgetary resources of an account , we extracted budget function information .

the budget function classification system describes 18 broad areas of national need and was developed to provide a coherent and comprehensive basis for analyzing and understanding the budget .

in some cases , the budgetary resources of a single account may be coded to multiple functions .

in these cases , we assigned the account to the budget function which received the majority of the account's budget authority in fiscal year 1995 .

however , budgetary resources in multi - function accounts were allocated to each of the functions according to the distribution of budget authority in the account .

to determine the type of budgetary resources available to an account , we aggregated data from the omb max system into four components: prior year authority , current year authority , permanent authority , and offsetting collections .

prior year authority reflects the balances of budget authority from previous years that remain available for obligation .

current authority is budget authority provided in fiscal year 1995 appropriations acts , while permanent authority is provided in standing authorizing legislation .

offsetting collections represent authority that results from the receipt of collections from other government accounts or collections from the public that are of a business - type or market - oriented nature .

offsetting collections are usually a form of permanent authority .

however , in this report , we segregated offsetting collections because the cyclical or business - type nature of such authority differs from other permanent authority .

to determine the extent of restrictions associated with the resources within an account , we extracted fund type information from the omb max system .

all governmental activities are financed through federal funds or trust funds .

federal funds are further separated into ( 1 ) general funds or special funds , to distinguish unrestricted receipts from those that are earmarked for a specific purpose , and ( 2 ) public enterprise funds or intragovernmental revolving funds , to distinguish between receipts arising from a cycle of business - type operations from the public or governmental organizations .

although trust funds are segregated into revolving and nonrevolving funds , for this report , we have aggregated both into a single trust fund category .

we computed median accounts , in terms of budgetary resources , to determine representative account sizes for federal mission , federal organization , appropriations subcommittee , and fund type .

statistical medians are particularly useful when wide variations exist across multiple dimensions .

unlike other statistical measures of central tendency ( for example , averages ) , medians are not influenced by a few extremely large or small values and thus yield a more representative account size .

we displayed ranges of account size with the median to illustrate variability .

to describe the predominant interests of the congress in enacting an account , we defined four orientations — object , organization , process , and program .

these orientations were derived from a literature search which focused on the key events or developments associated with federal budgeting practices and are not directly associated with a particular data element in the omb max system .

using the definitions we developed for each of these orientations , we reviewed each of the accounts in three judgmentally selected organizations and all accounts with more than $1 billion and less than $1 million in resources .

to aid in assigning the accounts to an orientation , we reviewed the account's title , statutory language , narrative statement , and budget presentations .

many accounts possess aspects which made assignment to a single orientation very difficult and somewhat arbitrary .

thus , the assignments presented in this report should be seen as suggestive or indicative , rather than definitive .

lastly , to develop historical and anecdotal data on the federal budget account structure , we performed literature searches and conducted interviews with budget specialists in academia , omb , the congressional research service , and the congressional budget office .

we also reviewed written documents produced by omb , the national performance review , and the federal accounting standards advisory board .
