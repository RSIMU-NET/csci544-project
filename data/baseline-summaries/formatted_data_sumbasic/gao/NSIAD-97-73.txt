the department of defense's ( dod ) budget request for fiscal year 1997 includes almost $89.2 billion for operation and maintenance ( o&m ) accounts .

this represents about 37 percent of dod's fiscal year 1997 budget request .

dod estimates that in fiscal year 2001 , o&m will represent about 36 percent of its total budget .

because o&m funds represent the largest share of dod's budget , we ( 1 ) determined how annual funding relates to military and civilian personnel levels through fiscal year 2001 , ( 2 ) identified overall trends from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 , and ( 3 ) identified key drivers ( areas in which most money has been budgeted ) through fiscal year 2001 .

this report highlights significant information upon which congress can focus its future budget deliberations .

throughout the report , we present some questions raised by reported o&m trends .

in addition , we explain the reasons for major changes in funding due to migrations of funds between o&m programs and activities .

however , we did not inquire into the reasons for changes in trends and funding differences among the services after taking the migrations into account .

we anticipate that our future work will address some of the reasons for changes concerning specific programs .

finally , we did not attempt to determine an appropriate level of o&m funding .

this review was performed under our basic legislative responsibilities .

however , because of your expressed interest and oversight responsibilities in the o&m accounts , we are addressing the report to you .

o&m is large , diverse , and widespread .

since 1987 , the o&m accounts have been the largest appropriation group in dod's budget and are expected to remain the largest through fiscal year 2001 .

o&m is one of six appropriation groups for dod .

when compared with the federal budget , dod's fiscal year 1997 o&m budget request represents approximately 18 percent of total federal discretionary spending and is larger than most federal agencies' fiscal year 1997 budget requests .

o&m funds support portions of dod's readiness and quality - of - life priorities .

this appropriation funds a diverse range of programs and activities that include salaries and benefits for most civilian dod employees ; depot maintenance activities ; fuel purchases ; flying hours ; environmental restoration ; base operations ; consumable supplies ; and health care for active duty service personnel , dependents of active duty personnel , and retirees and their dependents .

moreover , each service and dod agency spends o&m funds .

under dod's measurement of infrastructure , o&m funds approximately half of dod's infrastructure costs that can be clearly identified in dod's future years defense program ( fydp ) .

because dod wants to decrease infrastructure costs to help pay for modern weapon systems , it must look at this appropriation group for some of the intended savings .

infrastructure comprises activities that provide support services to mission programs and primarily operate from fixed locations .

o&m funding is affected by civilian and military personnel levels .

dod's fiscal year 1997 budget includes funds for about 800,000 civilians and 1.5 million active duty and full - time national guard and reserve military personnel .

civilian personnel levels have a direct effect because the majority of civilian salaries and benefits are funded by o&m .

although o&m does not fund military pay and allowances , the appropriation group supports many readiness activities and quality - of - life programs that are affected by the number of military personnel .

we examined trends in annual o&m funds and personnel levels and identified the activities funded by o&m appropriations using dod's fydp .

the fydp is an authoritative record of current and projected force structure , costs , and personnel levels that have been approved by the secretary of defense .

the fydp displays resources and personnel levels by programs and activities known as program elements .

there are about 3,800 program elements in the fydps between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

we analyzed fydp data from several different perspectives: aggregate o&m , federal budget account structure , dod organization , dod's infrastructure category and defense mission category ( dmc ) analytical frameworks , and dod's major defense program structure .

each perspective produces a different , but equally valid , overview .

total o&m funding for dod is projected to decline at a slower rate than either civilian or military personnel levels between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

figure 1 shows that , between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 , annual o&m funds are projected to decrease by over 20 percent ( from $110.4 billion to $87.8 billion ) , and both civilian and military personnel levels are also projected to decline , but at different rates .

between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , the level of annual o&m funding declined by 13 percent , from $110.4 billion to $96.0 billion .

however , this decline is projected to end during the 1997 fydp period ( fiscal years 1997-2001 ) , and annual o&m funds are projected to increase slightly in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 .

civilian personnel levels have fallen steadily since fiscal year 1989 and are projected to continue to decline through fiscal year 2001 .

this is important because , according to dod , over 40 percent of annual o&m appropriations fund civilian salaries and benefits .

o&m is projected to increase at the same time that the number of civilians is projected to decline .

this indicates that other o&m - funded programs are projected to increase to a greater extent than o&m - funded civilian salaries are projected to decrease .

the number of civilian personnel in dod has fallen by about 27 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , from 1.1 million persons to 830,000 .

by fiscal year 2001 , dod plans to have 729,000 civilians employed , an additional 12-percent decline .

although military personnel levels are projected to fall over the 17-year period covered by this report , most of the decline occurred prior to fiscal year 1996 .

military personnel levels fell by over 30 percent between the peak of 2.2 million persons in fiscal year 1987 to 1.5 million in fiscal year 1996 .

after fiscal year 1996 , military personnel levels are expected to decline by only 4 percent .

although military personnel salaries are not paid by o&m funds , o&m funds a variety of activities and programs that support military personnel and most readiness - related resources .

because personnel levels decline at a faster rate than annual o&m funding levels , annual o&m funds when allocated per person ( military and civilian ) are projected to increase by about 20 percent over the fiscal year 1985-2001 period , as shown in figure 2 .

o&m funding per person increased from $33,100 to $40,400 between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , a 21.9-percent increase .

although o&m funding per person is projected to decline in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 , it is expected to increase by 4.2 percent after fiscal year 1998 to $39,700 per person in fiscal year 2001 .

a small portion of the increase in o&m funding per person may be a result of dod's transferring functions previously performed in house to outside providers .

our analysis of dod's budget documents shows that the purchase of goods and services through contracts or from other federal agencies uses over half of dod's annual o&m funds .

the amount of contracting paid by o&m funds is projected to increase slightly between fiscal years 1988 and 1997 .

the following are some questions raised by the trend information presented in this section: why are o&m funds not projected to decline during the period covered by the 1997 fydp when civilian personnel levels decrease and military personnel levels stabilize ? .

how will outsourcing impact o&m costs in the out - years , that is , after fiscal year 1997 ? .

o&m budget accounts are organized in two ways , by service and program .

the 11 service - oriented accounts include funding for multiple programs and activities for specific - service , defense - wide , and the services' national guard and reserve programs .

the number of service budget accounts remained stable at 11 from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 .

in contrast , the number of program accounts grew from 4 in fiscal years 1985 to 1989 and peaked at 11 in fiscal years 1993 , 1994 , and 1997 .

projections show that between fiscal years 1998 and 2001 , dod will have 10 program accounts .

congress created the largest program account , the defense health program , in fiscal year 1993 .

dod moved all defense health care resources from the service and defense - wide accounts to this account .

as a share of total annual o&m funds , the defense health program budget account is projected to grow from 10.6 percent in fiscal year 1993 to 11.8 percent in fiscal year 2001 .

most program accounts were created to increase visibility for certain efforts or respond to unique needs .

for example , the former soviet union threat reduction budget account was created in fiscal year 1994 to help several newly independent states destroy weapons of mass destruction ; store and transport the weapons to be destroyed ; and reduce the risk of proliferation .

funds for this account peaked at $439 million in fiscal year 1995 and are projected to decline to $395 million in fiscal year 2001 .

the program accounts without the defense health program represent a small share of o&m funds , from less than one - tenth of a percent in fiscal year 1989 to a peak of almost 3 percent in fiscal year 1999 .

the o&m budget accounts vary in size .

from fiscal years 1985 to 1992 , approximately 90 percent of o&m funds are concentrated in four budget accounts: navy , army , air force , and defense - wide .

this concentration ( approximately 85 percent ) continues through fiscal year 2001 with the addition of one account — defense health program .

table 1 shows the concentration of resources by budget account for fiscal year 1996 .

dod has considerable discretion in budgeting for and carrying out o&m activities .

unlike the military personnel appropriation accounts , which are primarily composed of entitlements , most o&m spending is not set by law .

however , the o&m program accounts receive an annual appropriation separately .

as a practical matter , this means that funding levels for these specific programs are set by law .

for example , in fiscal year 1996 , congress appropriated $50 million for the program account , overseas humanitarian , disaster , and civic aid .

the fact that dod has discretion over most o&m funds does not mean that o&m funds are available without any controls .

o&m funds can only be obligated for authorized programs and purposes and are available for one fiscal year unless a longer period of availability is specified .

further , in annual authorization and appropriation acts , congress can impose direction to carry out particular activities or programs and can limit or prohibit spending for other activities .

finally , although reprogramming of funds within an appropriation is permitted , dod has committed itself to seek congressional approval before reprogramming $10 million or more in an o&m account .

the following is a question raised by the trend information presented in this section: should other budget accounts be created to increase visibility for o&m - funded programs ? .

prior to fiscal year 1992 , the three services received about 90 percent of o&m funds , and dod agencies received approximately 10 percent .

during this period , the navy / marine corps' share of o&m funds declined the most , by almost 6 percent , while the air force's annual share decreased by less than 2 percent .

the significant decrease in the navy / marine corps' portion of annual o&m funds occurred even though the navy / marine corps' civilian personnel levels declined by 5 percent less than the air force and the navy / marine corp's military personnel levels grew slightly over this period .

only the army experienced an increase in its share of annual o&m funds .

between fiscal years 1985 and 1990 , the army's portion of funding increased by 4 percent , while army military personnel levels fell by almost 3 percent and army civilian personnel levels fell by about 9 percent .

the army received an additional increase of 5 percent in its share of annual o&m funds between fiscal years 1990 and 1991 , but this surge in fiscal year 1991 funding was due to an infusion of o&m money for the army for the persian gulf war .

after fiscal year 1991 , dod centralized funding for health programs into a defense - wide o&m appropriation by shifting the funds for the program from the services' o&m appropriations .

this change caused a significant increase in the total annual o&m funds provided to the combined dod agencies .

in fiscal year 1992 , defense - wide o&m was almost 20 percent of total dod o&m funding .

in fiscal year 1996 , o&m funding became almost equally proportional among the three services and the combined dod agencies .

defense - wide appropriations remain at about one - quarter of total annual o&m appropriations through fiscal year 2001 .

although the proportion of o&m funds received by each of the three services declined after fiscal year 1991 , the army's share declined the most .

beginning in fiscal year 1998 , the army will annually receive the smallest portion of o&m funds .

by fiscal year 2001 , the army is expected to receive less than 23 percent of total annual o&m funds , while the navy / marine corps and the air force will each get approximately 26 percent of total o&m funds .

figure 3 shows the changes in o&m funding distribution in fiscal years 1985 , 1992 , 1996 , and 2001 .

the navy / marine corps' annual portion of o&m funds continued to decline after fiscal year 1991 and by fiscal year 1996 fell to 26.5 percent , almost 10 percent lower than the portion of funding in fiscal year 1985 .

the level of navy / marine corps military personnel fell almost 10 percent less than the other two services , while navy / marine corps civilian personnel levels fell by almost 30 percent , similar to the army .

after fiscal year 1996 , the portion of o&m funding provided to the navy / marine corps is projected to remain between 25.9 and 26.5 percent , while military personnel levels fall by 5 percent and civilian personnel levels decrease by 15 percent .

the air force's proportion of annual o&m funds changed the least of the three services .

although the air force's share of o&m funds fell by about 2 percent between fiscal years 1991 and 1992 , the air force's annual portion of o&m funds are planned to remain between 24.6 and 27.6 percent for the fiscal year 1993 through 2001 period .

during this period , both air force civilian and military personnel levels are projected to decline by 19 and 17 percent , respectively .

of the three services , the air force has the highest o&m cost per military and civilian person .

as shown in table 2 , even though the air force had fewer active military , full - time guard , reserve , and civilian personnel than either the army or the navy / marine corps , the air force's o&m cost per person in fiscal year 1996 was more than $46,000 per person compared with about $31,000 per person for the navy / marine corps and the army .

the army had approximately 152,000 more military and about 76,000 more civilians than the air force but received $100 million less in o&m funds in fiscal year 1996 .

the following are some questions raised by the trend information presented in this section: what factors contribute to the major shifts in funds among the services and combined dod agencies ( even after taking into account the dod health care funding migrations ) ? .

specifically , why is the army's share of annual o&m funds declining ? .

what causes the air force to have the highest per person o&m costs among the three services ? .

using the fydp , dod has identified program elements that fund infrastructure activities .

dod refers to these program elements as “direct infrastructure.” o&m funds about 50 percent of direct infrastructure during the fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

dod assigned each infrastructure program element to one of the following eight categories on the basis of the program's activities: acquisition infrastructure ; installation support ; central command , control , and communications ; force management ; central logistics ; central medical ; central personnel ; and central training .

these categories are described in appendix i .

there are parts of infrastructure that dod cannot identify using the fydp .

according to dod officials , this is about 20 to 25 percent of dod's total infrastructure funding and mostly represents logistics purchases that cannot be identified specifically .

funding for logistics purchases would likely come from o&m appropriations .

therefore , the proportion of total dod infrastructure funded by o&m is clearly greater than 50 percent .

during fiscal years 1985 through 2001 , direct infrastructure o&m funds decline by 22.6 percent , similar to total o&m trends .

as shown in figure 4 , o&m funding of direct infrastructure programs decreases after fiscal year 1991 .

this decline was primarily in the central logistics infrastructure category when the defense business operations fund was created .

moreover , the central logistics category received 35 percent less o&m funds in fiscal year 1992 than in fiscal year 1991 , in part , due to the conclusion of the persian gulf war .

despite these reductions , this category accounted for about 27 percent of the total value of direct infrastructure in fiscal year 1992 .

when o&m funding for the central logistics infrastructure category is excluded , as shown in figure 5 , o&m funding of direct infrastructure actually increased between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 .

large increases occurred in four infrastructure categories: central medical ; central command , control , and communications ; central personnel ; and acquisition infrastructure .

the increase in central medical o&m funding had the largest impact because in fiscal year 1985 central medical accounted for 15 percent of total direct infrastructure ( without central logistics ) and , by fiscal year 1996 , central medical's portion had grown to over 20 percent .

dod projects a slight decrease , about 3 percent , in o&m - funded direct infrastructure ( with and without central logistics ) between fiscal years 1997 and 2001 .

most of this decline is projected to occur in the installation support , force management , acquisition infrastructure , and central personnel infrastructure categories .

the following are some questions raised by the trend information presented in this section: what causes the projected out - year increases in o&m - funded direct infrastructure ( fiscal years 2000 and 2001 ) ? .

where will dod get savings in infrastructure to pay for modernization ? .

how will dod's modernization plans affect future o&m levels ? .

another way to analyze the changes and components of o&m funding is to aggregate fydp data by dod's major defense programs .

for its own force programming and budgeting purposes , dod organizes the defense budget into program elements that consist of collections of weapons , manpower , and support equipment .

program elements are grouped into 11 major defense programs .

each major defense program reflects a force mission or support mission of dod and contains the resources needed to achieve an objective or plan .

three major defense programs — general purpose forces ; central supply and maintenance ; and training , medical , and other general purpose activities — receive the majority of annual o&m funding .

in fiscal year 1996 , these three programs were allocated 65 percent of dod's o&m funds .

figure 6 shows that of the three programs , only the training , medical , and other general purpose activities program's annual funding has continued to increase over the fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

the training , medical , and other general purpose activities program's annual share of o&m appropriations increased by almost $4 billion between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 to about $19 billion .

dod plans to maintain this level of o&m funding for this program through fiscal year 2001 .

o&m funding per person for training , medical , and other general purpose activities has almost doubled over the fiscal year 1985-2001 period ; most of this growth occurred prior to fiscal year 1996 .

o&m funding for the general purpose forces program is projected to fall by 28 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

this corresponds to the decline in dod's overall force level .

the o&m funding per person assigned to this program is expected to generally remain between $25,000 and $30,000 per person over the entire fiscal year 1985 to 2001 period .

central supply and maintenance o&m funding declined significantly ( by 34 percent ) between fiscal years 1991 and 1992 when the defense business operations fund was created .

many of this program's supply , maintenance , and service activities were no longer directly funded , and the funds to pay for the goods and services provided by the program's activities were allocated to the customers ( eg , strategic and general purpose forces programs ) of these services .

the decline in program funding continued through fiscal year 1997 , albeit at a slower rate , and is projected to remain fairly stable at about $12 billion annually until fiscal year 2001 .

of the remaining eight major defense programs , the next two largest — ( 1 ) command , control , communications , intelligence , and space and ( 2 ) guard and reserve forces — are projected to receive approximately $10 billion and $8 billion , respectively , in annual o&m funds over the fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

 ( see fig .

7. ) .

even with the downsizing of the force , the annual level of o&m funding for both of these programs has remained fairly constant over the entire 17-year period covered by this report .

for the guard and reserve program , full - time personnel levels increased by almost 11,000 people over the fiscal year 1985-1996 period , yet part - time guard and reserve personnel levels declined by over 170,000 persons over the same period .

both full - time and part - time personnel numbers are projected to decline through 2001 .

even though the command , control , communications , intelligence , and space program's annual o&m funding level has not changed significantly throughout the fiscal year 1985-2001 period , its level of annual o&m funding per person associated with this program has increased by 30 percent over these 17 years .

most of this increase in o&m funding per person occurred prior to fiscal year 1995 .

the following are some questions raised by the trend information presented in this section: what factors cause the training , medical , and other general purpose activities program funding to increase steadily while military and civilian personnel levels decrease ? .

why is central supply and maintenance o&m funding not declining in the out - years ( after fiscal year 1997 ) if dod is improving the efficiency of these activities by using privatization and outsourcing ? .

why has the command , control , communications , intelligence , and space program's o&m funding not declined over time as dod has downsized ? .

why has the guard and reserve forces program's o&m funding not declined as the overall force level has declined ? .

why did the level of full - time guard and reserve personnel increase when part - time personnel declined by 170,000 prior to fiscal year 1996 ? .

partitioning total o&m funds using dod's dmc analytical framework shows that funding is concentrated among a few categories .

from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 , five mission categories received and are projected to receive about 50 percent of o&m funding .

between fiscal years 1993 and 2001 , the five largest categories are land forces , medical , naval forces , tactical air forces , and other logistics support .

in total , there are about 30 mission categories during the fiscal year 1993-2001 period .

figure 8 compares funding for different fiscal years for these five defense mission categories .

among the five largest categories in fiscal year 1996 , medical is the only category that experiences real growth — from $5.9 billion in fiscal year 1985 to $10.2 billion in fiscal year 2001 , a 72.8-percent increase .

most of the growth in medical occurs prior to fiscal year 1997 , and the majority of these costs are for health care needs .

in contrast , the naval forces category experiences the largest decline in real terms — from $15.2 billion in fiscal year 1985 to $8.4 billion in 2001 , a 44.6-percent decrease .

figure 9 shows the distribution of fiscal year 1996 o&m funding by defense mission category .

eight categories make up 71 percent of o&m funding ( $68.4 billion ) , and each category is greater than $5.1 billion .

remaining resources , $27.6 billion or 28.8 percent , reside in 22 categories and funding ranges from slightly more than $5 billion ( intelligence ) to $4.7 million ( federal agency support ) .

fydp projections show that resources remain concentrated in the same eight categories for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 .

our analysis of the eight categories with the highest dollar values in fiscal year 1996 shows that from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 , three categories ( medical , mobility forces , and departmental ) are projected to grow and five categories ( naval forces , other logistics support , training , land forces , and tactical air forces ) are projected to decline .

however , as shown in table 3 , these overall trends are not consistent over the 17-year period .

for example , the medical category increased by 73.2 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 but is projected to decline between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 .

in the land forces category , there is a slight increase between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 but a substantial decrease projected for the fiscal year 1996-2001 period .

although projections show that all categories will decrease in real terms from fiscal years 1996 to 2001 , medical's projected decrease is insignificant .

appendix ii provides a detailed analysis of trends and per person costs for the fiscal year 1996 eight highest dollar categories: land forces , medical , naval forces , tactical air forces , other logistics support , departmental , mobility forces , and training .

a similar concentration emerges when distributing annual o&m funds by dmcs for the 11 service budget accounts throughout the 17-year period .

for example , in fiscal year 1996 , over 55 percent of each account's o&m funds are concentrated in three defense mission categories .

the three largest dollar categories differ for each service budget account .

for example , in fiscal year 1996 defense - wide's three largest categories were intelligence , departmental , and other personnel support and received about 61 percent of total funding .

in contrast , the army's three largest dollar categories were land forces , training , and other logistics support and received about 70 percent of total funding .

table 4 shows the distribution of fiscal year 1996 o&m funds by dmcs for the o&m , navy budget account .

o&m , navy has and is projected to have the largest share of annual o&m funds compared with the other budget accounts — except in fiscal year 1991 .

o&m , army was the largest budget account in fiscal year 1991 .

the following are some questions raised by the trend information presented in this section: what factors contribute to the significant decline in the naval forces category between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 ? .

what factors are projected to contribute to the substantial decline in the land forces category during the fiscal year 1996-2001 period ? .

what factors contribute to the projected real decline during the fiscal year 1996-2001 period for medical , departmental , and mobility forces ? .

 ( in contrast , these categories experienced substantial real growth during the fiscal year 1985-96 period. ) .

can analyzing trends in concentrated o&m areas help dod in future budget plans ? .

we analyzed trends of three o&m programs — the defense health program ( o&m budget account ) , environmental spending , and base operating support — because of congressional interest and relevance in dod's effort to reduce infrastructure costs .

dod's health care system is considered a critical quality - of - life issue .

the defense health program budget account emerged in the fiscal year 1993 president's budget to centralize o&m health care resources .

prior to fiscal year 1993 , the resources were located in the service and dod - wide budget accounts .

this budget account differs from the dmc medical in that the account does not include resources for medical contingency hospitals and medical readiness units .

for fiscal year 1997 , dod estimates that 8.3 million beneficiaries are eligible to use the defense health program .

figure 10 shows that trend data for this budget account remains relatively stable , a 1.1-percent real decline during fiscal years 1993 through 2001 .

however , in the fiscal year 1997 fydp , dod projected a 7.2-percent real decline between fiscal years 1996 and 1997 .

discussions with a dod official indicated that fiscal year 1997 health care funds were reduced by the office of secretary of defense during preparation of the fiscal year 1997 president's budget submission .

the dod's environment - related programs that we analyzed are the defense environmental restoration program , environmental compliance , environmental conservation , and pollution prevention programs .

annual o&m funding for these environment - related programs more than doubled between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 , as shown in figure 11 .

over 90 percent of the funds for these environment - related programs in fiscal year 1996 was for the defense environmental restoration program and environmental compliance .

by fiscal year 2001 , the level of o&m funding for dod's environment - related programs is projected to decline by 23 percent from its fiscal year 1996 peak of $3.3 billion .

most of this decline is due to a planned 25-percent decrease in defense environmental restoration program o&m funds and a projected 18-percent decrease in funding for environmental compliance programs .

base operations and maintenance activities are required to sustain mission capability , quality - of - life , and workforce productivity .

funding for these programs is found throughout dod , in both force and support missions , and was analyzed at the fydp program element level for this report .

figure 12 shows that overall annual funding for base operations and maintenance activities has declined since fiscal year 1985 .

the level of o&m funds these programs received decreased by 16 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 and is projected to decline by an additional 18 percent by 1999 .

most of the falloff in earlier years is due to a decrease in o&m funding for real property maintenance and support activities , while after fiscal year 1994 the level of o&m funds provided annually to base operations activities decreases , as shown in figure 13 .

in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , base operations and maintenance activities are projected to receive a slight increase ( 2 percent ) in annual o&m funds as a result of an increase in funding of real property maintenance and support activities .

the following are some questions raised by the trend information presented in this section: why is funding for environmental - related programs expected to decline between fiscal years 1996 and 1997 ? .

what factors cause environmental projections to be considerably lower than prior - year spending ( since fiscal year 1993 ) ? .

what factors cause o&m base operating support projections to increase after fiscal year 1999 ? .

what impact has the base realignment and closure decisions had on base operations and maintenance costs ? .

why are annual base operations o&m funding levels cyclical ? .

why are real property maintenance funding levels not expected to decline in the fiscal year 1997-2001 period ? .

in oral comments , dod agreed with the report and offered points of clarification .

specifically , dod said that o&m funding per person is an inappropriate measure to assess future o&m requirements .

in our report , we analyzed o&m trends in a number of different ways , including annual o&m on a per person basis .

we believe each measure of o&m funding produces a different , but equally insightful and appropriate , overview .

furthermore , we did not attempt to determine an appropriate level of o&m funding .

dod noted that answering the questions following each section requires an understanding of the significant accounting changes that have occurred since fiscal year 1981 .

dod recommended that future o&m analysis use normalized fydp data .

 ( normalized fydp data account for the movement of funds whether inside the o&m accounts or to and from other appropriation accounts. ) .

we attempted to obtain the department's normalized database but at the time of our review it was unavailable .

moreover , we recognize that there are significant accounting changes that impacted dod's o&m accounts .

we discuss some of the changes in our report and structured our analysis to minimize their impact .

to identify trends in annual o&m appropriations and personnel levels and to determine the programs and activities funded by o&m , we analyzed data contained in dod's fydp .

the fydp is the most comprehensive and continuous source of current and historical defense resource data .

we used funding and personnel data from the historical fydp update ( june 1995 ) for fiscal years 1985-1993 , the fiscal year 1996 fydp for fiscal year 1994 data , and the fiscal year 1997 fydp for fiscal years 1995-2001 .

historical fydp data reflects actual ( 1 ) total obligational authority for programs and ( 2 ) personnel levels .

we adjusted the nominal dollars to constant fiscal year 1997 dollars using 1997 dod inflation indices for o&m costs .

since dod had not yet released its revised fydp database that adjusts fydp data for known accounting and program changes since fiscal year 1975 , while we were conducting our work , we were unable to normalize the data for these changes .

we do note in the report where these changes have impacted the trends .

we analyzed the fydp data by dod's major defense programs , federal budget account structure , and operating organization .

to aid in the identification and classification of the components that affect annual o&m funding levels , we also evaluated the fydp data using two analytical tools developed by dod — the dmc and the infrastructure categories .

the dmc structure is used to analyze fydp data in terms of a mission - oriented view of dod resources rather than a service - specific program view , and the infrastructure categories structure aids in the analysis of the resources required to support the combat forces .

we did not verify dod's allocation of program elements in its dmc and infrastructure category analytical tools .

in addition , we interviewed officials in the following dod offices: office of the dod comptroller , office of the under secretary of defense ( personnel and readiness ) , office of the under secretary of defense ( acquisition and technology ) , office of program analysis and evaluation , and the office of reserve affairs .

we also met with officials from the institute for defense analyses .

we reviewed our prior reports , pertinent reports by the congressional budget office , congressional research service , dod , the institute for defense analyses , and others .

our work was conducted from june 1996 to january 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .

we are providing copies of this report to appropriate congressional house and senate committees ; the secretaries of defense , the air force , the army , and the navy ; and the director , office of management and budget .

we will also provide copies to other interested parties upon request .

this appendix describes operation and maintenance ( o&m ) funding and military and civilian personnel trends in detail for eight defense mission categories ( dmc ) for fiscal years 1985 through 2001 .

in fiscal year 1996 , the eight categories were the highest dollar missions and represented 71 percent of o&m funds .

with assistance from the institute for defense analyses , department of defense ( dod ) developed the dmc structure to display ( by mission ) funds , personnel , and forces programmed in the future years defense program ( fydp ) .

the dmc framework is multitiered with each tier progressively more detailed .

for example , the first tier divides dod programs into three basic categories: major force missions , defense - wide missions , and defense - wide support .

these three programs are subdivided into five additional levels of detail .

one of these levels is the training category .

table ii.1 illustrates an example of the dmc structure for training .

our analysis of the eight categories aggregates o&m funds and personnel data at various levels of detail to provide comprehensive and useful information .

for the land forces category , o&m funds consist of army and marine corps division increments , non - divisional combat units , tactical support units , base operations and management headquarters , and operational support ; army systems support ; and army special mission forces .

total land forces o&m funds decrease more slowly than military and civilian personnel assigned to this category between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 as shown in figure ii.1 .

o&m funds decrease by 22.2 percent , with most of the decline projected to occur between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 .

in contrast , between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 military and civilian personnel levels decline by 34.4 and 36.5 percent , respectively .

between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 military personnel decrease by an additional 4.6 percent , while civilians decrease by less than 1 percent .

annual per person costs increase from $16,865 in fiscal year 1985 to $20,114 in fiscal year 2001 , a 19.3-percent increase .

figure ii.1: annual land forces o&m funds and personnel levels for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) as expected , the army has the largest share of total annual o&m funds for land forces .

from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 , the army has and is projected to have about 67 to 80 percent of total annual o&m funds .

figure ii.2 shows annual land forces o&m funds by federal budget account for fiscal years 1985 through 2001 .

infusion of o&m funds for the persian gulf war contributed to the army's higher share of o&m land forces funds in fiscal year 1991 .

when funds are grouped by missions within land forces , base operations and management headquarters is the largest category from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 .

this category supports real property maintenance , base communications , and base operations and management headquarters at fixed army and marine corps installations .

when compared with the other three land forces mission categories , as shown in figure ii.3 , the base operations and management headquarters category experiences the largest decline , a 37.4-percent decrease from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 .

most of the decline takes places after fiscal year 1991 .

figure ii.3: annual land forces o&m funds by mission for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) the medical category provides funds for care for active duty personnel , retired military personnel , and dependents .

the fiscal year 1997 president's budget estimates that 8.3 million beneficiaries are eligible to use the health care program in fiscal year 1997 .

unlike the defense health program budget account , the medical category includes funds for programs related to medical contingency hospitals and medical readiness .

another difference is that the medical category does not include funds for health personnel training ; however , the defense health program budget account has funds for education and training programs .

total medical o&m funds are projected to increase from $5.9 billion to $10.2 billion or by 72.8 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

although projections show that the fiscal year 1997-99 funding will be slightly lower than in fiscal year 1996 , medical o&m funds will begin to rise starting in fiscal year 2000 .

moreover , the fiscal year 2001 fydp projection almost matches the fiscal year 1996 level .

when funds are grouped by missions within the medical category , hospitals and other medical activities is the largest category between fiscal years 1985 through 2001 .

trends for the hospital and other medical activities category mirror those of total medical o&m funds .

o&m funds for the base operations and management headquarters category also grow between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 , a 69.8-percent increase .

unlike the hospital category , which declines slightly between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 , o&m funds for base operations and management headquarters increase by 12.1 percent during this period .

figure ii.4 compares the trends in funding for hospitals and other medical activities , base operations and management headquarters , and overall medical category .

figure ii.4: annual medical o&m funds for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) figure ii.5 shows that medical costs per eligible beneficiary will increase by 86 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

further , the fiscal year 2001 projected cost per eligible beneficiary of $1,223 nearly matches the fiscal year 1996 level of $1,229 .

figure ii.5: annual medical o&m costs per eligible beneficiary for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars ) although the total number of eligible beneficiaries is projected to decline between fiscal years 1989 and 2001 , starting in fiscal year 1995 , the total number of retirees and their dependents exceed the total number of active duty military personnel and their dependents ( see fig .

ii.6 ) .

between fiscal years 1989 and 2001 , retirees and their dependents increase by 16.7 percent , whereas active duty military personnel and their dependents decrease by 26.5 percent .

the naval forces defense mission category consists of mission forces ( submarines , surface combat ships , amphibious forces , service forces , mine warfare forces , maritime patrol , undersea surveillance forces , and sea based anti - submarine warfare air forces ) ; fleet support ( combat and logistics support , ordnance disposal forces , tactical communications , shore intermediate maintenance , and aircraft support squadrons ) ; other operational support ( command activities ; sea control operational headquarters ; and intelligence , communications , command , and control activities ) ; and base operations and management headquarters .

annual o&m funding levels for naval forces is projected to decline by 45 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 , as shown in figure ii.7 .

this decline was primarily caused by a 48-percent reduction in o&m funds for mission activities .

although mission activities funds have decreased , figure ii.8 shows that mission activities still receive about 60 percent of o&m funding .

figure ii.7: annual o&m funding for naval forces for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) almost all of the o&m funding for this category is for the active forces and , within active naval forces , the majority of o&m funding is for mission force activities .

as shown in figure ii.9 , most of the decrease between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 in active naval forces o&m funds was for mission activities , although the fleet support programs' o&m funding levels have declined as well over the same period .

figure ii.9: annual o&m funding for active naval forces allocated by activity for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) the level of o&m funding per person associated with active naval force mission activities has decreased from its 1985 value , as shown in figure ii.10 , but most of this decline occurred by fiscal year 1990 .

between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 , the o&m funds per person is expected to decline by only 5 percent .

the level of o&m funding per person for base operations activities ( the second largest activity within the naval forces mission ) remains relatively stable throughout the fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

figure ii.10: per person annual o&m funding for selected active naval force activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in thousands ) o&m funds for the tactical air forces category consists of air - to - air combat squadrons ; air - to - ground combat squadrons ; defense suppression forces ; tactical reconnaissance squadrons ; tactical command , control , and communications ; tanker / cargo squadrons ; other tactical air warfare forces ; non - strategic nuclear tactical forces ; operations support ; and base operations and management headquarters support activities .

like aggregate o&m trends , total tactical air forces o&m funds decrease at a slower rate than military and civilian personnel assigned to this category between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

 ( see fig .

ii.11. ) .

during the fiscal year 1985-2001 period , o&m funds decrease by 11.6 percent , with most of the decline projected to occur between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 .

in contrast , most of the decline in both military and civilian personnel levels occurs between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , a respective 34.4-percent and 24.6-percent decrease .

further , projections show that the fiscal year 2001 level of $7.8 billion slightly exceeds the fiscal year 1997 level .

annual per person costs increase from $29,911 in fiscal year 1985 to $41,211 in fiscal year 2001 , a 37.8-percent increase .

figure ii.11: annual tactical air forces o&m funds and personnel levels for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) when funds are grouped by service missions within the tactical air forces category , as shown in figure ii.12 , from fiscal years 1985 to 2001 , the air force is the largest category and experiences the smallest percentage change in funding , a 5.9-percent decrease , when compared with the navy and marine corps categories .

the navy tactical air forces category experiences the largest decline , a 35.9-percent decrease between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

most of the decline occurs between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 .

figure ii.12: annual tactical air forces o&m funds by service missions for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) marine in the tactical air forces mission category , when funds are grouped by primary mission , other tactical support , and base operations and management headquarters , funds for each category decline between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

 ( see fig .

ii.13. ) .

however , these overall trends are not consistent over the 17-year period .

between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , base operations and management headquarters is the only mission activity that grows , a 5.5-percent increase .

however , projections show that the base operations and management headquarters category will experience a 19.4-percent decrease in funds between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 .

for the other tactical support category , funds decrease by 6.7 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 ; however , this decrease is nearly canceled by the projected growth between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 , a 5.3-percent increase .

funding levels for primary missions decrease in both periods by 5.3 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 and by 8.7 percent between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 .

figure ii.13: annual tactical air forces o&m funds by mission activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) .

the other logistics support mission includes the following activities: logistics base operations and management headquarters , and miscellaneous logistics support activities such as industrial preparedness , second destination transportation , administrative support , printing plants and laundries , and information automation .

annual o&m funding for other logistics support mission activities fell to $5.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 from its peak of $8.7 billion in fiscal year 1987 , as shown in figure ii.14 .

 ( the surge in fiscal year 1991 o&m funding for this mission was an anomaly caused by a $2.3 billion infusion of funds for army and air force second destination transportation programs most probably for persian gulf war efforts .

the following year , fiscal year 1992 , o&m funding for these programs decreased by more than $2.7 billion and is projected to continue to decline at a slow steady rate through fiscal year 2000. ) .

the other decreases are due to consistent annual declines in o&m funding of logistics base operations and headquarters activities .

the declines in base operations had a significant impact on other logistics support o&m funding because base operations activities account for about 35 percent of total annual other logistics support funds .

overall , other logistics support o&m funds fell by 34 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 but are expected to remain relatively stable through fiscal year 2001 .

figure ii.14: annual o&m funding for selected other logistics support activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) by fiscal year 2001 , o&m funding per person for other logistics support activities is expected to be at about the same level as it was in fiscal year 1985 , as shown in figure ii.15 .

if the surge in fiscal year 1991 funding is ignored , o&m funding per person is planned to remain between $2,330 and $2,660 per person for the entire fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

figure ii.15: per person annual operation and maintenance funding for selected other logistics support activities ( constant 1997 dollars in thousands ) the departmental mission includes a wide range of department - wide service support activities such as the army's adjutant general , publications centers , and postal service agency ; the navy's accounting and finance center and its petroleum reserve ; and the air force's audit agency , intelligence service , and its finance and accounting center .

the mission also includes department - wide activities such as public affairs , personnel administration , service support to the office of the secretary of defense and other defense agencies , washington headquarters services , and the office of economic adjustment .

o&m funding levels for the departmental mission have grown since fiscal year 1985 .

between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , o&m funding for departmental activities grew by 16 percent , and most of this growth occurred after fiscal year 1991 .

much of the growth between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 was due to significant fluctuations in funding for programs assigned to this mission .

for example , washington headquarters services' annual o&m funding level grew almost threefold between fiscal years 1994 and 1995 from $169 million to $498 million , remained at this high level in fiscal year 1996 , but is projected to decline to $185 million in fiscal year 1997 , where its annual funding level is expected to remain through fiscal year 2001 .

other programs in the departmental mission only have had o&m funding in selected years , such as the defense - wide administrative maintenance and repair program .

o&m funding for this program appears only in fiscal years 1992 and 1993 for $563 million and $1.9 billion , respectively .

o&m funding for the departmental mission decreases by 5 percent between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 .

this slight decline in the mission's funding levels reflects the relative stability in annual o&m funding levels for most of the large programs contained in this mission , such as service - wide support ( not otherwise accounted for ) , office of the secretary of defense management headquarters , and defense contract audit agency activities .

figure ii.16 shows the trend in o&m funding for departmental mission activities during the fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

figure ii.16: annual o&m funding for departmental mission activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) seventy - five percent of o&m funds for the departmental mission support the active military , and the remaining 25 percent of o&m funds for this mission are for departmental activities that support the national guard and reserve .

figure ii.17 shows that o&m funding for departmental activities that support the active military generally remained between $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion prior to fiscal year 1993 and are projected to remain between $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion for the fiscal year 1996-2001 period .

since the programs that caused the fluctuations in the overall departmental mission's o&m funding levels between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 , such as the washington headquarters service , support the active military , these same programs caused the fluctuations shown in figure ii.17 .

o&m funding for departmental missions that support the active military are projected to decline between fiscal years 1996 and 2001 by about 4 percent , only slightly less than the 5-percent decline in the overall departmental mission's o&m funding level during the same period .

figure ii.17: annual o&m funding for departmental mission activities that support the active military for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) o&m funding per person for departmental missions that support the active military has grown by over 50 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 as shown in figure ii.18 .

as the amount of o&m funds provided to the large departmental programs grew between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 , the number of active military personnel fell and the civilians associated with the departmental activities that support the active military declined .

after fiscal year 1996 , the level of o&m funds allocated to each person for this mission is projected to remain virtually unchanged through fiscal year 2001 .

figure ii.18: per person annual o&m funding for departmental mission activities that support the active military ( constant 1997 dollars in thousands ) o&m funds for the mobility forces category consist of programs and activities for multimode and intermodal lift forces , airlift forces , sealift forces , and land mobility forces .

as shown in figure ii.19 , between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 , total o&m funds for the mobility forces category increase from almost $3.8 billion to $5.5 billion , or by 45.5 percent .

most of the increase occurs between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , a 54.6-percent increase .

among the eight categories in our analysis , this category has the second largest percentage change in funding during the fiscal year 1985-2001 period .

figure ii.19: annual mobility forces o&m funds for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) when funds are grouped by missions within mobility forces , between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 , airlift forces is the largest category funded by direct o&m appropriations .

 ( see fig .

ii.20. ) .

the surge in fiscal year 1994 o&m funds was for airlift base operations .

throughout the 17-year period , land mobility forces o&m funds increase from $871 thousand in fiscal year 1985 to almost $653 million in fiscal year 2001 and have the largest percentage change in funding when compared with sealift and airlift forces .

figure ii.20: annual mobility forces o&m funds by mission for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) when funds are grouped by missions within airlift forces , during the fiscal year 1985-2001 period , military intertheater airlift has the largest percentage change in funding ( 225.6 percent ) when compared with other airlift forces missions .

moreover , starting in fiscal year 1996 , military intertheater airlift is projected to have the largest share of annual airlift forces o&m funds .

military intertheater airlift is comprised of active , national guard , and reserve airlift squadrons and support activities .

figure ii.21 shows the distribution of total fiscal year 1996 o&m funds by mission within airlift forces .

projections show that , for the fiscal year 1997-2001 period , each airlift forces category share of annual o&m funding closely mirror the fiscal year 1996 share .

aeromedical airlift ( 0.31% ) airlift command , control , communications ( 0.72% ) airlift rescue and recovery ( 2.78% ) military intertheater airlift ( 37.78% ) military intratheater airlift ( 23.34% ) .

the training defense mission category consists of all military personnel training , civilian personnel training , flight training , intelligence skill training , health personnel training , and training base operations and management headquarters .

figure ii.22 shows that the o&m funding level for the training mission decreased by 22 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1993 and is projected to remain fairly level through fiscal year 2001 .

if o&m funding for training base operations and management headquarters is removed from the overall o&m funding level of the training mission as shown in figure ii.22 , the amount of o&m funds provided to this mission is projected to decrease by only 14 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 2001 .

military personnel training and flight training activities receive over 85 percent of the remaining annual o&m funds for this mission .

figure ii.22: annual o&m funding for training for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) much of the decline through fiscal year 1993 was for training base operations and management headquarters activities .

base operations and management headquarters activities have received and are planned to continue to receive the largest portion of annual o&m funds for this mission category , although its portion of the training mission's o&m funds has declined .

figure ii.23 shows that military personnel training ( mostly general skills training and support of the training establishment ) has declined as the active force declined , and funding for this activity is planned to remain fairly constant from fiscal year 1996 to 2001 when military personnel levels are projected to stabilize .

o&m funding for flight training activities ( mostly undergraduate pilot training ) , though , has not changed much over the 17 years covered by this report .

figure ii.23: annual o&m funding for selected training mission activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) since civilian and guard and reserve personnel training accounts for a very small portion of the total training mission , we focused our analysis of o&m funding for the mission by service on active military personnel training only .

as displayed in figure ii.24 , the army has received and plans to continue to receive more annual training mission o&m funds than either the air force or the navy / marine corps , although the army's share of annual o&m funds for this mission has decreased along with its force structure .

the army is projected to receive 35 percent fewer annual training o&m funds in fiscal year 2001 than it received in fiscal year 1985 .

this decline is due mostly to planned declines in military personnel training ( general skills training ) and training base operations and management headquarters .

the only army training area that received an infusion of o&m funds in the fiscal year 1985 to 1996 period was flight training , but after fiscal year 1996 , funds for this training are projected to decline by almost 7 percent .

for the projected period through fiscal year 2001 , only the military personnel training area is expected to receive an increase in o&m funds .

figure ii.24: annual o&m funding by service for active military training mission activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in billions ) figure ii.24 also shows that o&m training funds for the navy / marine corps and the air force have declined between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 in concert with declines in their force structure , but similar to the army , funding levels are expected to remain fairly stable in the out - years .

between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 , the navy / marine corps o&m training mission funds decreased by 24 percent and the air force's funding level decreased by 16 percent .

after fiscal year 1996 , o&m funding for the navy / marine corps training base operations is projected to continue to decrease .

however , o&m funding for navy / marine corps military personnel , flight , and intelligence skill training is expected to grow .

flight training is the only area that is planned to receive an increase ( 12 percent ) in o&m funds for the air force during the fiscal year 1996 through 2001 period .

o&m funding for the training mission per full - time military and dod civilians declined by 8 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1993 , but after fiscal year 1993 grew annually through fiscal year 1996 , as presented in figure ii.25 .

it is projected to remain stable after fiscal year 1996 until fiscal years 2000 and 2001 when funding per person will increase by approximately 2 percent per year .

if base operations and management headquarters is removed from overall o&m funding of the training mission , the o&m funding per full - time military and dod civilians remained fairly stable at about $1,200 per year through fiscal year 1993 , when it began to increase annually .

the level of o&m funding per person is projected to increase to over $1,400 by fiscal year 2001 .

figure ii.25: per person annual o&m funding for training activities for fiscal years 1985-2001 ( constant 1997 dollars in thousands ) figure ii.26 shows that the pattern of o&m funding per person for the training mission for each service's active military differs .

the o&m funding level per person for active air force training grew the most ( over 30 percent ) between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 and peaked at $3,300 per person by fiscal year 1996 .

our analysis of fydp data shows that this level of funding per person is projected to be reached again in fiscal years 1998 and 2001 .

although the o&m funding for training per active army military person fell to its lowest level in fiscal year 1994 , it increased annually during fiscal years 1995 and 1996 , and will increase annually again in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , when it will peak at $4,500 per person .

the navy / marine corps o&m funding per person for active military training fell by 15 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1993 but is projected to increase annually through fiscal year 1997 , and fall slightly in fiscal year 1998 , when it will increase about 1 percent per year again until it reaches $2,600 per year in fiscal year 2000 .
