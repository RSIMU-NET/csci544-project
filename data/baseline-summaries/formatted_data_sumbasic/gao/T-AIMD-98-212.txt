we are pleased to join you today to discuss the computing crisis posed by the upcoming change of century , and its implications in one critical area: telecommunications .

as you know , the year 2000 presents a particularly sweeping and urgent challenge for entities in this country .

for this reason , in february 1997 we designated the year 2000 problem as a high - risk area for the federal government , and have published guidanceto help organizations successfully address the issue .

since that time we have issued over 45 reports and testimony statements detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the year 2000 compliance of a wide range of federal agency systems .

the common theme has been that serious vulnerabilities remain in addressing the federal government's year 2000 readiness , and that much more action is needed to ensure that agencies satisfactorily mitigate year 2000 risks to avoid debilitating consequences .

we have made many recommendations to the executive branch to reduce the risk of year 2000-induced disruptions of critical services .

among these , we recommended that the chair of the president's council on year 2000 conversion develop a comprehensive picture of the nation's year 2000 readiness .

this effort would include identifying and assessing the risk of the nation's key economic sectors , including those posed by telecommunications .

 .

as a result , if not modified , computer systems or applications that use dates or perform date - or time - sensitive calculations may generate incorrect results beyond 1999. and telecommunications technologies .

in particular , such technologies have helped fuel the growth of the u.s. economy and have enabled major improvements in the nation's infrastructure .

as a result , telecommunications service providers and their public - and private - sector customers have a lot at stake ; the potential losses and disruptions that could accrue from noncompliant telecommunications systems could be staggering .

my testimony today will ( 1 ) describe our nation's telecommunications infrastructure , ( 2 ) discuss the risks we face if critical components of that infrastructure are not year 2000 compliant by the turn of the century , ( 3 ) describe federal government actions relating to national , international , and governmental telecommunications infrastructure , and ( 4 ) present issues that must be addressed .

the telecommunications infrastructure comprises the public telecommunications network ; the internet ; and the millions of computer systems for government , defense , commercial , and personal use .

the public network includes a complex web of interconnected networks operated by local and long - distance carriers , cellular networks , and satellite services .

the internet is a global network of networks interconnected by routers using a common set of protocols .

significant portions of the internet rely on services provided by the public telecommunications networks .

the rich array of reliable telecommunications services is made possible by a complex web of highly interconnected networks supported by switchesand other telecommunications devices .

along with national and local carriers and service providers , other important links in the chain are the equipment manufacturers and suppliers and customers , some of whom have specific telecommunications devices installed on their premises , such as private branch exchanges ( pbx ) , and voice mail systems .

the key is connectivity: all of the pieces must work together .

telecommunications are critical to the operations of nearly every public - and private - sector organization .

all other major sectors rely on it: banking and finance ; health , safety , and emergency services ; transportation ; utilities ; and manufacturing and small business .

for example , it ( 1 ) enables the electronic transfer of funds , ( 2 ) is essential to the service economy , manufacturing , and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods , and ( 3 ) is basic to responsive emergency services .

the federal government depends on the telecommunications infrastructure to deliver a wide range of services .

many agencies , including those in the department of the treasury and department of health and human services ( hhs ) , rely on both their private networks and on the public telecommunications network to conduct mission - critical business .

for example , the route of an electronic medicare payment may traverse several networks — those operated by the hhs , treasury's computer systems and networks , and the federal reserve's fedwire electronic funds transfer system .

seamless connectivity among a wide range of networks and carriers is essential nationally and internationally .

recent nationwide telecommunications failures remind us of our dependence on telecommunications — and the fragility of complex communications systems .

on april 13 , 1998 , a software error in a single switch caused a major carrier to fail nationwide .

according to press reports , during the 24-hour outage , the carrier's corporate customers were unable to complete critical network - based business ; retailers were unable to authorize credit card payments ; and financial institutions could not complete electronic transactions .

another failure occurred on may 19 , 1998 , when a communications satellite went into an uncontrolled spin after failure of a control system .

the satellite's failure disrupted the operations of credit card authorization services , paging services for 80 to 90 percent of all pagers in the united states , and the distribution of television programs .

while these failures were not caused by a year 2000 problem , they illustrate the degree to which we depend upon reliable , available , interoperable telecommunications .

major disruption in the service provided by the public telecommunications network can affect millions of users and cause massive financial losses .

the cost of disruptions and outages caused by noncompliant computer or telecommunications systems was discussed in a recent study of the potential impact of year 2000-related foreign exchange settlement failures .

according to the study , the market costs of a single major bank's inability to settle its trades could reach $3.3 billion in a single week .

business dependence on the public telecommunications infrastructure is particularly evident in the retail and financial sectors , where financial transactions with a combined value in the billions of dollars are made every day .

businesses and financial institutions rely heavily on telecommunications networks to participate in the global payments system , to exchange information with trading partners and regulatory agencies , and to manage their internal control systems and sophisticated computer equipment .

the consequences of not resolving year 2000 problems in the telecommunications infrastructure are broad - based and potentially disastrous .

for example , if critical telecommunications systems fail: the internal revenue service would be unable to receive electronic tax returns or process electronic tax refunds .

hhs would be unable to make electronic medicare payments .

financial institutions and brokerages would be unable to process financial transactions and trades .

the manufacturing and retail sectors would be unable to manage inventories .

air travel would have to be severely curtailed because air traffic control systems would fail .

credit card transactions would be hindered if communications links with point - of - sale systems fail .

emergency services would suffer if 911 calls were not properly and promptly routed .

international voice and data services would be disrupted .

telecommunications problems can affect virtually all network components — switches , routers , pbxs , and internet servers — all of which must be assessed and tested .

compounding the risk is the global nature of today's telecommunications , which rely on seamless connections among widely scattered and widely diverse networks .

in light of the potential risks involved , the federal government has recently begun to address the year 2000 readiness of the telecommunications sector .

the government is undertaking telecommunications initiatives from three perspectives: national , international , and governmental .

on february 4 of this year , the president's council on year 2000 conversion was created , with the mandate to cooperate with private - sector operators of critical national and local systems , including telecommunications , in addressing the year 2000 crisis .

the council's recently established telecommunications working group — chaired by a federal communications commission ( fcc ) commissioner — held its first meeting on april 29 , 1998 ; membership includes representatives of the departments of agriculture , commerce , defense , and state ; fcc ; the general services administration ( gsa ) ; and the national science foundation .

the group reports that it is developing a strategy and an action plan to address the key issues facing the telecommunications sector .

these include raising industry awareness of the problem and disseminating information on best practices and contingency planning .

in addition to its role on the council , within the past 2 months fcc has established a year 2000 internet web site , formed a task force to coordinate the activities of fcc bureaus to provide year 2000 information for consumers and industry , and coordinated an outreach effort to state public utility commissions .

its specific national efforts are focusing on raising the year 2000 awareness of companies under its jurisdiction , monitoring the status of year 2000 readiness of the telecommunications sector , and helping telecommunications users obtain information from individual telecommunications service providers needed for testing .

as part of this campaign , fcc in late april sent letters to over 200 telecommunications service providers , industry associations , and other interested organizations , advising them of the seriousness and potential impact of the year 2000 problem and asking them to share information about the year 2000-compliance status of their services with fcc , others in the telecommunications industry , and the public — including making such information available on the internet .

fcc is also contacting additional service providers and equipment manufacturers , and is working with industry associations to reach the hundreds of small and midsized telecommunications service providers .

the securities and exchange commission also has an initiative to gather information on companies' year 2000 activities .

in october 1997 and january 1998 , the commission urged public operating companies ( which would include those in the telecommunications sector ) to disclose their anticipated costs , problems , and uncertainties associated with the year 2000 issue .

fcc is also working on the international front , by coordinating with the international telecommunications union to reduce the risk of disruption to international telecommunications services .

in addition , the department of state has initiated discussions between embassies and public telecommunications network providers worldwide to determine the potential impact of the year 2000 problem .

in july 1997 , the department's diplomatic telecommunications services program office sent a cable to foreign posts asking them to determine whether the local telecommunications carriers — the national post , telephone , and telegraph companies — are aware of the problem and whether they are making plans to ensure the availability of telecommunications services on january 1 , 2000 .

year 2000 actions concerning the federal government's telecommunications networks have been initiated by the chief information officers ( cio ) council's year 2000 committee , gsa , and federal agencies .

the cio council year 2000 committee has a telecommunications subcommittee to focus on telecommunications issues in addressing the year 2000 problem .

this subcommittee , chaired by gsa , has adopted a year 2000 telecommunications compliance program that lays out a framework , including milestones , for agencies to use in addressing telecommunications issues .

this compliance program also focuses on enhancing partnerships with industry to identify year 2000-compliant products and services , develop test methodologies and processes , perform collaborative testing of network elements / systems , and share compliance information and test results .

the subcommittee is also addressing contingency planning for telecommunications .

in addition to its role chairing the subcommittee on telecommunications , gsa owns , manages , or resells consolidated telecommunications services to federal agencies throughout the united states ; it controls about 25 percent of all federal telecommunications services .

gsa's year 2000 program addresses three service areas: federal telecommunications system ( fts 2000 ) services , other federal telecommunications services , and commercial services .

in the fts 2000 area , gsa plans to complete assessment of year 2000 compliance by this september , renovation by march 1999 , and validation and testing between april and december 1999 .

in the other federal services area , gsa is supporting agencies in hardware testing , is conducting year 2000 telecommunications working group meetings with agency representatives , and is managing its year 2000 web site .

in the area of commercial services , gsa plans by march 1999 to conduct interoperability testing between government systems and network service providers .

key federal initiatives are in their early stages on a national , international , and governmental level , and critical issues remain to be addressed .

less than 19 months remain , yet no one currently has an overall assessment of the degree of year 2000 risk in the telecommunications infrastructure .

accordingly , it is imperative that the executive branch , and particularly fcc and the conversion council's telecommunications working group , take a more active approach to addressing the year 2000 issues of the domestic and international telecommunications sectors .

establish public / private partnership forums composed of representatives of each major sector that , in turn , would rely on task forces organized along economic sector lines to help ( 1 ) gauge the nation's preparedness for the year 2000 , ( 2 ) periodically report on the status and remaining actions of each sector's year 2000 remediation efforts , and ( 3 ) ensure the development of contingency plans to assure the continuing delivery of critical public and private services .

in disagreeing with this recommendation , the chair of the conversion council stated his belief that the council needs to be a catalyst , facilitator , and coordinator .

he did , however , establish five new working groups — telecommunications among them ; while not providing specific guidelines or expectations , the chair told them to focus on developing a coordinated outreach plan and establish communications with public and private parties within each sector , and to monitor the year 2000 readiness of each sector .

given the inarguably critical nature of telecommunications services to the functioning of our nation , coordinated oversight is essential .

in order to gain confidence that our telecommunications infrastructure will be ready for the next century , accountability must be established ; this includes a broad strategy as well as specific milestones and defined accountability .

we see several major areas that must be addressed: ( 1 ) obtaining information on the current readiness status of various segments of the telecommunications industry for the next century , ( 2 ) establishing a mechanism for obtaining such readiness information on a regular basis , ( 3 ) setting milestones for achieving year 2000 compliance , ( 4 ) disseminating readiness status information to the public and the congress , and ( 5 ) developing — in conjunction with the private sector — contingency plans to ensure business continuity , albeit at reduced levels , in the event that not all telecommunications systems are fully operational on january 1 , 2000 .

based on data from industry associations and telecommunications companies , fcc has compiled general information on the status and activities of various segments of this sector .

in late april of this year , the agency asked the telecommunications industry for year 2000-compliance information ; however , as of last week , fcc was unable to provide us with information on the current status and anticipated readiness dates in areas such as satellite , cable , broadcast , and wireless services .

as a major example , fcc could not provide us with data on when major interexchange ( long distance ) and local exchange carriers were expecting to be year 2000 compliant .

because fcc did not have such data readily available , we attempted to obtain year 2000 milestone information from the major interexchange ( long distance ) and local exchange carriers .

we focused on these 12 carriers because they hold key positions within the telecommunications sector and account for over 90 percent of the market .

we obtained this information from the carriers' world wide web sites , or through telephone interviews with carrier representatives .

table 1 provides a summary of the information we gathered .

the table shows that most major carriers expect to achieve year 2000 compliance of their networks by december 1998 , although for some it is either later than that date or we were unable to obtain this information .

the table also shows that most major carriers plan to be fully compliant — including support systems — by mid - 1999 .

in addition to the individual carrier information shown in the table , some interoperability testing is planned .

this laboratory - based testing , sponsored by the telco year 2000 forum and by the alliance for telecommunications industry solutions ( atis ) , is scheduled to begin later this year and continue throughout 1999 .

the forum - sponsored testing will focus on interoperability between local exchange carriers , while the atis - sponsored tests will focus on common equipment interoperability between a local exchange carrier and a long - distance carrier .

not only is it important that fcc know the current status of telecommunications preparedness , it is imperative that such information be obtained on a regular basis .

just as the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the congress monitor individual agency progress through quarterly reports on the status of year 2000 systems compliance , fcc would benefit from a mechanism that would provide updated status data on a recurring basis .

without this information , fcc will find it more difficult to address major problems that may occur .

fcc's recent letters to the industry are a start , but ongoing receipt of information will be essential to effectively monitor sector readiness .

while telecommunications service providers are establishing their own year 2000 schedules , fcc has not developed schedules and milestones for the various segments of the telecommunications industry to achieve year 2000 compliance .

milestones for activities such as renovation , validation , and implementation are important to overall year 2000 telecommunications planning and for evaluating progress in reaching compliance .

beyond obtaining current and ongoing status information , it is important that fcc make such information available to the public — including telecommunications customers — and the congress .

the dissemination of this information could provide continuous information about the preparedness of this essential sector for the century change .

potential vehicles for such dissemination include regular reports to the congress .

contingency plans should be formulated to respond to two types of failures: predictable ( such as repairs or replacements that are already far behind schedule ) and unforeseen ( such as a system that fails despite having been certified as year 2000 compliant or one that , it is later found , cannot be corrected by january 1 , 2000 , despite appearing to be on schedule today ) .

given the central nature of telecommunications to the ability of other sectors to be year 2000 ready , a public / private partnership could be formed to develop and test necessary contingency plans , critical to ensuring the continuity of service in the event of failures .

little is known about the year 2000 readiness of foreign telecommunications carriers and their ability to continue to provide telecommunications services after december 31 , 1999 .

in september 1997 , the gartner group conducted several surveys to determine how companies around the world were dealing with the year 2000 problem .

the study did not focus on the telecommunications sector ; however , its findings provide an indication of the overall year 2000 readiness of the various geographic regions of the world .

according to the study , “hirty percent of all companies have not started dealing with the year 2000 problem .

small companies , health care organizations , educational institutions , and many companies in 30 percent of the world's countries are at a high risk of seeing year 2000 mission - critical failures due to a lack of readiness.” a more recent survey focusing on foreign telecommunications service providers was conducted by the international telecommunication union ; its results are not yet available .

fcc has also noted that year 2000 issues have not received the same level of attention abroad as in the united states , with the exception of the united kingdom .

this was confirmed by the results of the state department's initiative to assess the year 2000 readiness of foreign carriers .

as shown in table 2 , the department received information from 113 countries , updated through march 1998 .

of those , 25 countries ( 22 percent ) expected to be compliant by this december ; 26 countries ( 23 percent ) expected to be compliant by december 1999 ; 33 countries ( 29 percent ) stated that they were addressing the year 2000 issue but were having problems ; and 29 countries ( 26 percent ) were unaware of or had not begun to address the problem .

the state department is continuing its activities to determine the year 2000 readiness of its foreign posts , and is developing contingency plans to ensure continuity of diplomatic telecommunications services .

the world bank is reporting similar findings .

in an informal survey of foreign year 2000 readiness conducted this month , only 18 of 127 countries ( 14 percent ) had a national year 2000 program ; 28 countries ( 22 percent ) report working on the problem ; and 16 countries ( 13 percent ) report only awareness of the issue .

no conclusive data were received from the remaining 65 countries surveyed ( 51 percent ) .

the world bank is now planning to appoint a field year 2000 representative for each country .

the year 2000 readiness of international telecommunications networks and carriers is clearly an area of concern .

all sectors of the global economy depend upon reliable communications networks to handle billions of dollars in financial transactions .

current and ongoing information to monitor the compliance status of foreign carriers would , therefore , allow the federal government and the private sector to identify troubled regions and develop contingency plans for ensuring the continuity of vital telecommunications services .

without compliant telecommunications , federal agencies will be unable to provide basic services to the american public .

however , many major departments and agencies do not yet know the year 2000 compliance status of their own telecommunications networks and services .

in fact , many federal agencies are just beginning to assess the readiness of their telecommunications .

as of last month's quarterly reports to omb , only 11 of 24 major federal agencies reported that they had completed inventories and / or assessments of telecommunications .

the department of agriculture , for example , does not expect to complete its telecommunications inventory until next month — a critical assessment task that should have been completed last summer .

in closing , let me reiterate that the importance of the telecommunications infrastructure in the successful functioning of our nation cannot be overemphasized ; it is the linchpin of our economy and critical citizen services .

yet the telecommunications industry faces a massive challenge to make sure that it can finish the year 2000 job in time .

while the federal government must take a stronger , more active oversight role to help ensure that this central sector is prepared , much of the responsibility inevitably lies with the industry and other countries around the world .

madam chairwoman , this concludes my statement .

i would be pleased to respond to any questions that you or other members of the subcommittee may have at this time .
