backgroundsites in dna that bind regulatory proteins can be detected computationally in various ways . pattern discovery methods analyze collections of genes suspected to be co - regulated on the evidence , for example , of clustering of transcriptome data . pattern searching methods use sequences with known binding sites to find other genes regulated by a given protein . such computational methods are important strategies in the discovery and elaboration of regulatory networks and can provide the experimental biologist with a precise prediction of a binding site or identify a gene as a member of a set of co - regulated genes ( a regulon ) . as more variations on such methods are published , however , thorough evaluation is necessary , as performance may differ depending on the conditions of use . detailed evaluation also helps to improve and understand the behavior of the different methods and computational strategies.resultswe used a collection of 86 regulons from escherichia coli as datasets to evaluate two methods for pattern discovery and pattern searching : dyad analysis / dyad sweeping using the program dyad - analysis , and multiple alignment using the programs consensus / patser . clearly defined statistical parameters are used to evaluate the two methods in different situations . we placed particular emphasis on minimizing the rate of false positives.conclusionsas a general rule , sensors obtained from experimentally reported binding sites in dna frequently locate true sites as the highest - scoring sequences within a given upstream region , especially using consensus / patser . pattern discovery is still an unsolved problem , although in the cases where dyad - analysis finds significant dyads ( around 50% ) , these frequently correspond to true binding sites . with more robust methods , regulatory predictions could help identify the function of unknown genes .
