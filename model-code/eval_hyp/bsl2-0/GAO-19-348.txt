this report examines ( 1 ) factors that may account for differences in the percentage of children who receive special education services across states , and ( 2 ) how education and selected states monitor and support child find requirements .
to obtain information for both objectives we ( 1 ) reviewed education's special education data for school years 2011 through 2016 ( the most recent data available at the time of our review ) ; ( 2 ) reviewed relevant department information , such as dear colleague letters ( documents through which education communicates policy information ) , frequently asked questions , and questions and answers ; federal laws ; federal regulations and policies ; and selected state laws and regulations ; ( 3 ) interviewed education officials ; and ( 4 ) interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable selection of four states ( colorado , iowa , massachusetts , and new york ) from state agencies responsible for special education and from 15 school districts within those states .
idea — the primary federal special education law for infants , toddlers , children , and youth with disabilities — is administered at the federal level by the u.s. department of education's ( education ) office of special education programs ( osep ) .
you asked us to examine how states implement idea's child find requirements and how education oversees state implementation of child find .
in addition , special education experts and advocates have expressed concerns about both over - representation and under - representation of minorities in special education , which could indicate that these students are not appropriately being identified and evaluated for special education .
the series alleged that , to reduce costs , the texas education agency ( tea ) set an 8.5 percent cap on the percent of students who could receive special education services , and intensified monitoring of school districts that exceeded that level .
under part b of idea states receiving part b funds are required to make a free appropriate public education available to all eligible children with disabilities .
nearly 7 million children between the ages of 3 and 21 ( about 13 percent of the total number of students enrolled in public schools ) received special education services during school year 2015-16 under the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) .
to do so , idea requires states to have policies and procedures to ensure that all children with disabilities residing in the state are identified , located , and evaluated .
concerns about the identification and evaluation of children have been raised by the media , experts , and special education advocates .
this requirement is known as “child find,” and is generally implemented by local school districts .
for example , in fall 2016 , the percentages of the population aged 6 through 21 served in individual states ranged from 6.4 percent to 15.1 percent .
for instance , a 2016 series of investigative reports by the houston chronicle alleged the systematic delay or denial of special education services for children with disabilities in texas .
education monitored tea and found , among other things , that some school districts took steps designed to keep the percentage of children receiving special education services at or below the 8.5 percent cap .
