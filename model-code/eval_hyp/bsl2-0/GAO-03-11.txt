to date , there has been debate regarding the effectiveness of such companies in managing public schools .
as agreed with your office , we ( 1 ) identified the characteristics of their programs and determined the extent to which district schools managed by them have used their programs and ( 2 ) determined what is known about the effectiveness of these companies' educational programs , as measured primarily by student achievement .
in recent years , local school districts and traditional public schools have taken various initiatives to improve failing schools .
these companies generally offer schools services in areas such as school organization , instruction , technology , and professional development .
for example , school districts and charter schools are increasingly contracting with private , for - profit companies to provide a range of education and management services to schools .
in the district of columbia , some public schools currently contract with three such companies: edison schools , mosaica education , and chancellor beacon academies .
to address these issues , we reviewed relevant research on charter and traditional public schools managed by for - profit educational management companies as well as documents and materials provided by the companies .
we also interviewed officials of the companies that manage district public schools , officials of the district's oversight authorities , and representatives of the schools , as well as officials of the department of education , other education experts and advocates .
in addition , we observed an on - site review of one school's program which was conducted for district oversight authorities .
finally , we reviewed evaluations concerning the three companies operating in the district that met the following criteria: included comparison groups and measurement of performance over time , and focused on academic achievement , parental satisfaction , parental involvement , or school climate .
we conducted our work between january and september 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
we assessed the quality of the evaluations' research designs , reviewed them for threats to validity and determined whether we had confidence in their conclusions .
all of these companies offer programs that include management and educational services , such as curricula that integrate technology and professional development opportunities for teachers .
several methodological techniques that would have strengthened its overall findings could have been employed .
additional research is in progress .
company officials report that one way to determine if their programs are effective is to assess whether students demonstrate academic growth as evidenced by improvement on standardized tests .
these include controlling more specifically for school - level differences between the participating students as well as better ensuring the two groups of students remained equivalent despite study dropouts ( subsequently referred to as attrition ) .
these limitations included use of comparison groups that did not adequately control for differences between the students in the company's schools and the students in traditional public schools , instances where achievement data were not available for all students , and lack of adjustment for high attrition rates .
the remaining studies had methodological limitations that precluded such assessments .
similar to traditional public schools , the district schools managed by these companies were required to be open to all students , up to their enrollment limits , and to meet district standards in areas such as health , safety , standardized testing , and compliance with federal special education requirements .
