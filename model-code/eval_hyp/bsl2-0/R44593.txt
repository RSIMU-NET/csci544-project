the nfip is managed by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , through its subcomponent the federal insurance and mitigation administration ( fima ) .

the last long - term reauthorization of the nfip was by the biggert - waters flood insurance reform act of 2012 ( hereinafter bw - 12 ) , from july 6 , 2012 , to september 30 , 2017 .
according to fema , the program saves the nation an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses avoided because of the nfip's building and floodplain management regulations .
the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) was created by the national flood insurance act of 1968 ( nfia ) .
the nfip received a short - term reauthorization through december 8 , 2017 , a second short - term reauthorization through december 22 , 2017 , and a third short - term reauthorization through january 19 , 2018 .

nationally , as of january 2019 , about 22,355 communities in 56 states and jurisdictions participated in the nfip .
the nfip lapsed between january 20 and january 22 , 2018 , and received a fourth short - term reauthorization until february 8 , 2018 .
this report provides introductory information on key components of the nfip , ranging from floodplain mapping to the standard flood insurance forms .
the nfip lapsed for approximately eight hours during a brief government shutdown in the early morning of february 9 , 2018 , and was then reauthorized until march 23 , 2018 .
the nfip accomplishes the goal of reducing comprehensive flood risk primarily by requiring participating communities to collaborate with fema to develop and adopt flood maps called flood insurance rate maps ( firms ) .
in addition , premiums collected from the sale of insurance in the nfip finance a flood mitigation assistance ( fma ) grant program that reduces overall flood risk .
enact minimum floodplain standards based on those flood maps .
generally , the nfip has been funded through three methods: receipts from the premiums of flood insurance policies , including fees and surcharges ; direct annual appropriations for specific costs of the nfip ; and borrowing from the u.s. treasury when the balance of the nfif has been insufficient to pay the nfip's obligations ( e.g. , insurance claims ) .
