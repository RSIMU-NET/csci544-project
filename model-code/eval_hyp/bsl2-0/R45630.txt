although other mspb employees , including administrative judges who issue initial decisions in cases , will continue their work , some members of congress and others have raised concerns about the extent to which these vacancies limit the agency's ability to perform its other functions .
the board may also order federal agencies to comply with board orders , conduct special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems , and review office of personnel management ( opm ) rules and regulations to determine , for example , whether a federal agency has invalidly implemented the opm requirements .
the mspb also aims to promote an effective federal workforce free of prohibited personnel practices .
the board mainly carries out its mission through adjudication of federal employee appeals of adverse actions .
when the board determines that a federal employee has been subject to an improper adverse action , it may order relief , including reins tatement , backpay , and attorney' s fees .
however , as of march 2019 , the board lacks any sitting members .
the merit systems protection board ( mspb or board ) is a n independent , executive branch agency that works to protect current , former , and prospective federal employees against inappropriate employment - related actions , in accordance with " merit system principles ," statutorily defined standards governing the performance and management of the federal workforce .
federal law specifies that the board consists of three members appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate .
the report then addresses the board's authority to adjudicate matters within its jurisdiction and the scope of this jurisdiction , as well as the availability of judicial review for the board's decisions .
this report focuses on the board's adjudicatory authority .
this report discusses the establishment of the mspb and its structure , as well as the role of the office of special counsel , an independent , prosecutorial agency that operates concurrently with the board .
finally , the report examines the effect of the lack of a quorum of board members .
over the next few decades , congress enacted additional measures addressing issues such as merit hiring , due process rights , and appeals of agency adverse personnel actions , and the csc played an increasingly larger role in implementing these requirements .
more specifically , the act established a civil service commission ( csc ) authorized to aid the president in preparing suitable civil service rules for open , competitive examinations of applicants for federal employment .
even so , some members of congress and others expressed concerns with the regulatory structure of the civil service system .
aljs typically adjudicate and issue initial decisions in cases involving corrective and disciplinary action .
in response to these and other issues , congress passed the civil service reform act ( csra ) , the most comprehensive reform of the civil service system since the pendleton act and the current legal framework governing the federal civilian workforce .
the board has original jurisdiction over actions brought by the special counsel for corrective and disciplinary action , specified removals of persons in the senior executive service ( ses ) , and certain adverse personnel actions taken against administrative law judges ( aljs ) .
