proponents of the labor shortage scenario assert that the nation's rate of economic ( output ) growth will slow because worker - starved u.s. firms would be unable to produce the quantity of goods and services demanded by u.s. consumers .
they further argue that the competitive position of u.s. industries will suffer because foreign companies would expand sales not only to the domestic market but also to other markets now supplied by u.s. firms .
the market share of u.s. businesses could shrink as well , if domestic and foreign purchasers react to these higher prices by switching to less costly goods and services from other countries .
while the public budgetary effects of the aging of the baby - boom cohort have been much studied , the implications for the private economy have been less thoroughly researched .
employers would try to pass the increased cost of production onto buyers , resulting in higher prices that , among other things , would diminish the purchasing power of u.s. workers' wages .
the scenario similarly does not consider that congress might take legislative action to mitigate the effect on the private economy of a perceived shortfall of workers — something it has done in the recent past ( e.g. , loosening and raising the cap on h - 1b visas for foreign workers in professional occupations ) .
in 2007 , however , the national unemployment rate averaged just 4.6% .
this suggests the presence of tight labor market conditions that are related to long - running demographic trends .
this frequently voiced view omits actions that employers could take , other than raising wages , to ameliorate the labor market tightness they expect to occur when baby - boomers stop working .
concern about this possibility waned when the historically low unemployment rates from 1998 to 2000 rose during , and for some two years after , the march - november 2001 recession .
even if businesses were able to coax more individuals into the u.s. labor force by bidding up wages , it is claimed that a similar end - result could occur .
as a consequence , observers — particularly members of the business community — have expressed the belief that the supply of u.s. labor will fall short of employer demand in coming decades .
the oldest members of the baby - boom generation will reach 60 years of age by the end of 2006 , and every year thereafter , more of the 76 million persons born between 1946 and 1964 will move into their early 60s , when most workers traditionally have retired .
u.s. employers again have turned their attention to the shortage of labor they anticipate will occur in the not - too - distant future .
it also assumes that baby - boomers will behave similarly to preceding generations of older workers in terms of the rate at which they participate in the labor force and the length of their working lives .
in addition , shortage proponents often paint firms with a broad brush , raising the question of whether each firm is as likely as the next to be affected by the baby - boomers' retirement .
it first sets forth past and projected trends in the supply of labor available to u.s. businesses in general .
