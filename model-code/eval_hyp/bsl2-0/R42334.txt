112-25 ) , the department of defense ( dod ) is considering how to absorb a reduction of about $490 billion in planned programs through fy2021 .
as a result of limits on discretionary spending in the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l .
after several years of rapid growth in defense budgets , measures to reduce federal budget deficits have led to projections of a substantial decline in military spending over the next decade .
senior defense officials have said that such reductions can be managed , but they also warn that that trade - offs among defense programs will require a strategically grounded re - assessment of priorities , and deeper cuts would weaken critical capabilities .
a common theme is , unless reductions are managed prudently , budget cuts of the magnitude required , let alone larger cuts , would risk creating a hollow force as former secretary of defense robert gates put it: i am determined that we not repeat the mistakes of the past , where the budget targets were met mostly by taking a percentage off the top of everything , the simplest and most politically expedient approach both inside the pentagon and outside of it .
that kind of "salami - slicing" approach preserves overhead and maintains force structure on paper , but results in a hollowing - out of the force from a lack of proper training , maintenance and equipment — and manpower .
that's what happened in the 1970s — a disastrous period for our military — and to a lesser extent during the late 1990s .
the administration has invoked the specter of a hollow force to describe what could happen to the u.s. armed forces if significant cuts to the defense budget are enacted .
given the administration's plan to reduce troop strength in response to budgetary limitations and a new strategic direction , congress — in its oversight , authorization , and appropriations role — will likely encounter administration officials who claim that the u.s. military faces the prospect of once again becoming a hollow force as congress will play a major role in shaping the armed forces both in terms of size , capabilities , and how it is equipped and trained , a nuanced understanding of how the military once became "hollow" could provide a useful context for current and anticipated legislative action .
while some members and staff might be familiar with the hollow force and its causes , newer members and staff might not have a similar understanding of the conditions that led to the hollow force in the past and what actions were taken to improve the situation .
with defense spending limited by ongoing battles over budget deficits , dod elected to protect readiness - related funds for operations , but at the expense of extending a "procurement holiday" in which relatively little money was available to finance new weapons platforms .
the congressional budget office ( cbo ) suggested that other factors — notably overall priorities within the defense budget — also contributed to the hollow force: between 1969 and 1975 , public disillusionment with the nation's role in vietnam encouraged rapid reductions in defense spending .
yet the underlying problem may have been an imbalance between defense resources and national security commitments that made it impossible for dod to buy both readiness and modernization .
