these loans are made by banks and other private lenders from their own funds and are insured by hud's federal housing administration ( fha ) .
under the hud 2020 management reform plan and related efforts , hud is making significant changes in all of its single - family housing programs , including the title i property improvement program .
concerned about how well this title i program was being operated , you and congressman bentsen asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the information needed to manage the program was available to hud , ( 2 ) the extent to which hud was overseeing program lenders , and ( 3 ) whether hud has any ongoing or planned efforts under way to strengthen its management and oversight .
if borrowers default on their loans , banks submit claims to hud , which approves or denies them .
hud also provides limited oversight of lenders' compliance with program regulations , conducting only 2 on - site lender reviews in fiscal year 1997 of the approximately 3,700 program lenders .
hud officials attributed these weaknesses to the program's being lender - operated , limited staff resources , and hud's assignment of monitoring priorities .
theses changes are motivated in part by hud's goals to downsize the agency and address long - standing agencywide management weaknesses .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss the preliminary results of our assessment of certain aspects of the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) management and oversight of its loan insurance program for home improvements under title i of the national housing act .
homeowners who have little equity in their home , at times obtain title i property improvement loans to make alterations or repairs to their homes .
as a result of the management and oversight weaknesses we have observed , our preliminary work indicates that hud does not know who the program is serving , if lenders are complying with program regulations , and whether certain potential program abuses are occurring , such as violations of the $25,000 limitation on the amount of title i loan indebtedness for each property .
in addition , some claims were paid by hud even though there were indications that lenders did not comply with required underwriting standards when insuring the loan .
regarding the need for oversight of lenders' compliance , we found that loan claim files submitted by lenders to hud following loan defaults often do not contain required loan documents , including the original loan applications and certifications signed by the borrower that the property improvement work has been completed .
moreover , hud does not maintain information on why it denies loan claims or why it subsequently approves some for payment .
we are assessing the extent to which these changes may affect the management and oversight weaknesses we identified .
specifically , we found that hud collects little information when loans are made on program borrowers , properties , and loan terms , such as the borrower's income and the address of the property being improved .
to meet these objectives , we reviewed , among other things , hud's title i program regulations and guidelines , 16,556 claims paid by hud between january 1994 and august 1997 to identify if any multiple claims were submitted on the same borrower for the same property , documents from a random sample of 53 loan claims paid to lenders by hud from fiscal years 1995 through july 1997 , and interviewed hud officials in washington , d.c. , and albany , new york â€” the location of the programs' claims examination unit .
