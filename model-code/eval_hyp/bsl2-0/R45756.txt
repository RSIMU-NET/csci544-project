using unclassified sources , crs estimates that dod seeks to invest approximately $9.7 billion in fy2021 funding for ew programs .
congress has shown an interest in the department of defense's ( dod's ) electronic warfare ( ew ) portfolio , requiring an independent assessment of ew plans and programs in the fy2019 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) .
this report addresses u.s. military ew funding across research , development , test , and evaluation ( rdt&e ) and procurement appropriations .
using the fy2019 through fy2021 budget request documents , this analysis compares funding profiles between fiscal years , as well as projected funding across the future years defense program ( fydp ) .
the following analysis looks at ew funding identified by the dod's ew executive commission ( ew excom ) .
the ew excom identified a series of rdt&e program elements from three of the military services ( air force , army and navy ) , as well as several defense agencies ( defense advanced research projects agency , defense information systems agency , the joint staff , office of the secretary of defense operational test and evaluation , and u.s. special operations command ) .
discussion of specific ew - related programs , as well as an overview of electronic warfare , are outside the scope of this report .
using the program elements identified , this analysis extrapolates procurement funding to provide an overview of dod investments in electronic warfare in fy2019 and fy2020 and requested investments in fy2021 .
over the past two decades , china and russia have seen u.s. military command and control , intelligence surveillance , and reconnaissance ( c2isr ) networks as a critical capability that they must develop capabilities against which to effectively compete .
similarly , in its fy2019 through fy202 1 defense budget overview request documents , dod identified ew as a priority to improve platform and network survivability ; provide advanced jamming techniques to disrupt radars , communications , and command and control systems ; and provide measures to defend the space domain and maintain power projection forces .
the national defense strategy commission , an independent congressional commission charged with evaluating the dod's national defense strategy , identified ew as a critical capability to achieve the goals of the national defense strategy .
historically , individual ew programs have not been generally seen as large enough for in - depth congressional scrutiny ; however , combined , these programs represent funding levels nearly as much as an aircraft carrier ( $12.5 billion in total procurement for cvn - 80 ) or the f - 35 joint strike fighter procurement ( $10.7 billion in fy2019 ) .
congress might consider requiring dod to report all ew - related funding for procurements , as well as ensuring that dod is not procuring new or advanced electronics through other appropriations .
similarly , china has developed sophisticated ew capabilities to disrupt and deny adversary access to command and control systemsâparticularly space - based systems .
both countries , as a result , have invested heavily in ew - related systems .
congress may consider whether dod uses research and development funding to procure new electronic components .
not only has the chinese military been developing new systems , but it routinely exercises with them .
