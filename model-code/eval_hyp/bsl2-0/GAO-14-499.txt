today , significant questions remain about how much the u.s. iter project will cost , when it will be completed , and how doe plans to manage the impact of u.s. iter project costs on the overall u.s. fusion program in a constrained federal budget environment .
this report examines ( 1 ) how and why the estimated cost and schedule for the u.s. iter project have changed since 2006 ; ( 2 ) the reliability of doe's current cost and schedule estimates for the u.s. iter project and the factors , if any , that have affected their reliability ; and ( 3 ) the actions doe has taken , if any , to reduce u.s. iter project costs and plan for their potential impact on the overall u.s. fusion program .
we also noted the risk that management challenges facing the iter organization could result in iter construction delays and further increase costs for the united states .
among those benefits would be no emissions of greenhouse gases , no risk of the type of severe accidents that could occur at existing nuclear power plants , and no long - lived radioactive waste .
fusion has the potential to be an abundant source of energy to help meet future energy needs , and it also offers many other benefits .
the house and senate appropriations committees , in particular , have expressed concern that doe will fund the u.s. iter project at the expense of the rest of the u.s. fusion program , and they have directed doe to provide detailed cost and schedule estimates for the project .
in fiscal year 2014 , the u.s. iter project received $199.5 million , which represented about 40 percent of that year's overall u.s. fusion program budget and continued a pattern of substantial funding increases for the project that began in fiscal year 2011 after several years of fluctuating funding levels .
however , since the iter agreement was signed in 2006 , the expected total cost of building iter has grown by billions of dollars from its original estimate of about $5 billion , and its construction schedule has slipped by years , as have the cost and schedule estimates for the u.s. portion of the construction project .
in this context , you asked us to review doe's cost and schedule estimates for u.s. contributions to iter's construction .
through march 2014 , doe had spent about $692 million on the project .
we noted at the time that doe had made a commitment to provide hardware components to iter without a definitive cost and schedule estimate and a complete project design and , as a result , doe's preliminary cost estimate of $1.122 billion for u.s. contributions to iter's construction might be subject to significant change .
over the last 50 years , scientists around the world have made progress in understanding how to create the conditions for fusion , but many outstanding scientific and technical questions must still be addressed before fusion can be used as an energy source .
by participating in iter , the united states will share the cost of building this complex and expensive fusion device , benefit from the scientific and technological expertise of the six other iter members , and have full access to iter research results .
