the new york times reported in january 2008 that the bush administration has crafted a draft proposal for a u.s. - iraq security agreement which would , if agreed upon by the parties , provide the united states with broad authority to conduct military operations in iraq , guarantee u.s. military forces and contractors immunity from iraqi law , and provide the united states with the power to detain iraqi prisoners .
during testimony before the senate committee on armed services on february 6 , 2008 , secretary of defense robert m. gates stated that the prospective security agreement would not obligate the united states to militarily defend iraq in the event of a threat to iraqi security .
the new york times also reported that the draft proposal does not call for the establishment of permanent u.s. military bases in iraq , authorize future troop levels in the country , or describe the specific security obligations of the united states should iraq come under attack .
it is not clear whether the agreement ( s ) discussed in the declaration will take the form of a treaty or some other type of international compact .
among other things , the declaration proclaims the parties' intention to negotiate a security agreement to support the iraqi government in training , equipping , and arming the iraqi security forces so they can provide security and stability to all iraqis ; support the iraqi government in contributing to the international fight against terrorism by confronting terrorists such as al - qaeda , its affiliates , other terrorist groups , as well as all other outlaw groups , such as criminal remnants of the former regime ; and to provide security assurances to the iraqi government to deter any external aggression and to ensure the integrity of iraq's territory .
presently , the administration intends to negotiate two separate security agreements with iraq .
the first agreement would constitute a legally binding status of forces agreement ( sofa ) to define the legal status of u.s. forces within iraq .
according to a february 5 , 2008 , report by the congressional quarterly , the national security council offered to brief congress on the nature of the prospective u.s. - iraq security agreement .
in a february 13 , 2008 , op - ed piece for the washington post , secretary of defense gates and secretary of state condoleezza rice claimed that the administration "will work closely with the appropriate committees of congress to keep lawmakers informed and to provide complete transparency .
classified briefings have already begun , and we look forward to congressional input. .
on march 4 , 2008 , during a joint hearing before the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle east and south asia and the subcommittee on international organizations , human rights and oversight , ambassador david m. satterfield , senior advisor to the secretary and coordinator for iraq , testified that seven background briefings by senior administration officials had been held with members of congress concerning the prospective u.s. - iraq agreement .
pursuant to this declaration , the parties pledged to "begin as soon as possible , with the aim to achieve , before july 31 , 2008 , agreements between the two governments with respect to the political , cultural , economic , and security spheres. .
