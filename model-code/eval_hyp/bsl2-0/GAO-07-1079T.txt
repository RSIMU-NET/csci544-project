major decisions still need to be made regarding infrastructure , housing , levee protection , coastal restoration , and economic recovery , among other issues .
i would like to: ( 1 ) place the federal assistance provided to date in the context of varied damage estimates for the gulf coast ; and ( 2 ) discuss the key federal programs that provide rebuilding assistance , with an emphasis on public assistance ( pa ) and community development block grants ( cdbg ) .
our ongoing work in mississippi , southern louisiana , and new orleans confirms that some communities still lack fulfillment of basic needs , such as schools , hospitals , and other infrastructure , while the doors of many businesses remain closed .
wide swaths of housing , infrastructure , and businesses were destroyed , leaving more than 1,500 people dead and hundreds of thousands of others displaced without shelter and employment .
the size and scope of the devastation caused by the gulf coast hurricanes presents the nation with unprecedented rebuilding challenges as well as opportunities to reexamine shared responsibility among all levels of government .
almost 2 years since the hurricanes made landfall , many gulf coast neighborhoods and communities still need to be rebuilt — some from the ground up .
the gulf coast and the nation continue to face daunting rebuilding costs , uncertainty surrounding numerous decisions linked to the availability of federal funds , and the complexity of integrating multiple public and private decisions that will influence the future of the region .
agreeing on what the costs are , what rebuilding should be done and by whom , and who will bear the costs will be key to the overall rebuilding effort .
in doing so , we will highlight aspects of gulf coast rebuilding likely to place continued demands on federal resources .
we also interviewed various federal officials from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and the coordinator of federal support for the recovery and rebuilding of the gulf coast region within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and analyzed federal regulations and state policies regarding funding for the gulf coast .
my testimony today will offer some preliminary observations on the federal financial implications of rebuilding efforts in the gulf coast .
these observations may assist you in your oversight of these activities — now and over the longer term .
congress will be faced with many questions as it continues to carry out its critical oversight function in reviewing funding for gulf coast rebuilding efforts .
how effective are current funding delivery mechanisms — such as pa and cdbg — and should they be modified or supplemented by other mechanisms ? .
what options exist to effectively build in federal oversight to accompany the receipt of federal funds , particularly as federal funding has shifted from emergency response to rebuilding ? .
all levels of government , together with the private and nonprofit sectors , will need to play a critical role in the process of choosing what , where , and how to rebuild .
specifically , we analyzed state and local documentation related to funding for rebuilding and interviewed state and local officials as well as representatives from nongovernmental organizations in these two states .
