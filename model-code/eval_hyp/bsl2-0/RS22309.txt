in this report , the terms bill ( s ) or measure ( s ) refer to bills and joint resolutions .
 ( senate rules contain procedures for processing concurrent and simple resolutions ( rule xiv , paragraph 6 ) , treaties ( rule xxx ) , and nominations ( rule xxxi ) , which are not covered in this report. ) .
broadly , the two purposes of preventing the referral of a bill or joint resolution to a committee and placing it directly on the calendar are ( 1 ) to facilitate the full senate's opportunity to consider the measure ; or ( 2 ) to bypass a committee's potential inaction or , to the measure's sponsor , potential hostile action .
although placing a bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full senate will ever consider it , the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps , such as committee reporting or discharging a committee from a bill's consideration , and procedural requirements , such as the two - day availability of a committee report , may be obviated .
when the house informs the senate that it has passed a bill or joint resolution that was introduced in the house , and the senate receives the measure , the measure is also usually referred to a senate committee .
the senate may , however , use provisions of senate rule xiv to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a senate committee in order to have the measure placed directly on the senate calendar of business .
although a senator may demand ( under paragraph 2 ) that the readings occur on three different legislative days , bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day "for reference" ( referral ) if there is no objection ( under paragraph 3 ) .
the calendar's general orders section lists measures eligible for senate floor consideration .
senate rule xiv , paragraph 2 requires that bills and resolutions have three readings before passage , and that they be read twice before being referred to committee .
 ( the "third reading" occurs before a vote on final passage. ) .
when a senator introduces a bill or joint resolution , the measure is usually referred to committee , pursuant to provisions of senate rules xiv , xvii , and xxv .
most bills and resolutions are read twice and referred to committee on the same day that they are introduced by a senator or received from the house .
 ( emphasis added . ) .
senate rule xiv , paragraph 4 , states: "... every bill and joint resolution introduced on leave , and every bill and joint resolution of the house of representatives which shall have received a first and second reading without being referred to a committee , shall , if objection be made to further proceeding thereon , be placed on the calendar . .
therefore , through objection , a bill or joint resolution after two readings is prevented from being referred to committee and is placed directly on the calendar .
it is usually the majority leader ( or another senator in his stead ) , acting on his own or at the request of any other senator , who objects to "further proceeding" — committee referral — on a measure .
