fuel ethanol consumption has grown from roughly 1 billion gallons per year in the early 1990s , largely as a result of federal policies promoting its use , including tax incentives and mandates for the use of renewable fuels .
the rfs mandates the use of 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008 , increasing steadily through 2022 ( figure 1 ) .
however , a limit of 10% ethanol would mean that ethanol for gasoline blending ( not including e85 ) likely cannot exceed 14 billion gallons per year .
arguably the most significant incentive for ethanol's use is the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) established in the energy policy act of 2005 and expanded in the energy independence and security act of 2007 .
in 2010 , the united states consumed roughly 13 billion gallons of fuel ethanol , representing about 10% of all u.s. gasoline consumption ( by volume ) .
currently , although some ethanol is sold as an alternative fuel ( e85 ) , most is sold as an additive in conventional and reformulated gasoline .
in 2012 , the rfs will require over 15 billion gallons of renewable fuel , while projected gasoline consumption in 2012 is just above 140 billion gallons .
after 2012 , the renewable fuel mandate will continue to increase .
before epa's decision on the growth energy waiver petition , the amount of ethanol that could be blended in gasoline for all conventional gasoline vehicles and engines was limited to 10% by volume ( e10 ) by guidance developed by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) under the clean air act ( caa ) , as well as by vehicle and engine warranties , and certification procedures for fuel - dispensing equipment .
by 2022 , eisa requires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels , and much of this would likely be ethanol from a variety of feedstocks .
going forward , there are limitations on the amount of corn - based ethanol that may be used to meet the mandate , although it is likely that much of the additional mandate for "advanced biofuels" will be met using ethanol derived from sugarcane and from cellulosic feedstocks such as perennial grasses , fast - growing trees , and agricultural wastes .
under eisa , epa had 270 days ( december 1 , 2009 ) to grant or deny the waiver .
research is ongoing on intermediate - level blends , including 15% , 20% , 30% , and 40% ethanol ( e15 , e20 , e30 , and e40 , respectively ) .
on march 6 , 2009 , growth energy ( on behalf of 52 u.s. ethanol producers ) applied to epa for a waiver from the caa e10 limit .
while the rfs is not an explicit ethanol mandate , the vast majority of the requirement has been met using corn - based ethanol .
however , there is a key obstacle to the use of so much ethanol in gasoline .
the waiver would allow the use of significantly more ethanol in gasoline than was permitted under the 10% limit .
it is likely that the actual limit is lower , since older fuel tanks and pumps at some retail stations may not be equipped to handle ethanol - blended fuel .
