ongoing congressional interest in the professional experiences of judicial nominees reflects , in part , the evaluative role of congress in examining the qualifications of those who are nominated by the president to life - tenure positions .
the professional experiences of judicial nominees are also of interest to interest groups , particularly professional organizations such as the american bar association ( aba ) .
judicial nominees are evaluated by the aba's standing committee on the federal judiciary .
senators , when giving floor speeches supporting circuit court nominations , routinely highlight certain professional experiences or qualifications often considered important to serving as a federal judge .
examples of such statements include the following: a senator noting that a nominee to the fourth circuit court of appeals had 22 years of prior judicial experience "at the state courts and the federal courts. .
other scholars suggest that the lack of career diversity among federal judges might be problematic , in terms of the lack of diversity diminishing the institutional performance of the courts .
the senator also noted that prior to the nominee's service as a state judge , the nominee had "practiced commercial litigation for 7 years at one of wisconsin's most prestigious law firms. .
the committee's evaluation criteria focus "strictly on professional qualifications: integrity , professional competence and judicial temperament. .
this report provides an analytic overview of the professional experiences and qualifications of those individuals who are currently serving as active u.s. circuit court judges .
another study found that district court judges whose primary work before becoming a judge involved non - private practice work experience ( e.g. , working as a government attorney or law professor ) were less likely to rely on regulations and other internal revenue service pronouncements in interpreting the federal tax code than judges whose work prior to becoming a judge was predominately as an attorney in private practice .
the senator stated that the nominee "has not only served as a distinguished judge , but also he came to the courts as an experienced prosecutor .
for example , one study found that prior judicial experience for u.s. circuit court judges did not influence variation in judicial decision making in terms of the extent a judge voted in a consistent ideological fashion ( such prior experience might have been hypothesized to be a source of consistency in judicial voting ) .
additionally , the professional or career experiences of judges prior to the start of their judicial service has also been of interest to scholars examining whether particular professional experiences might influence or explain variation in aspects of judicial decision making ( e.g. , whether a judge votes in a consistent ideological direction , the sources relied upon by a judge in reaching his or her decisions , whether a judge decides to publish his or her opinions , etc. ) .
the senator also stated that the nominee had served as chairman of the state's professional ethics commission and as president of the state's bar association , and that "his 30-plus years of real - world litigation experience would bring a valuable perspective to the court. .
the committee also notes , however , that "distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in - court trial work ... may compensate for a prospective nominee's lack of substantial courtroom experience. .
