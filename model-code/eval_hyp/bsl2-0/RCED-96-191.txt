the program's total federal costs for this period were over $5 billion â€” about $4.5 billion in cash reimbursements and over $600 million in commodity foods , such as beef patties , flour , and canned vegetables .
in fiscal year 1995 , about 26 million students in about 94,000 schools ( public and private schools and residential child care institutions ) nationwide were served lunches each day through the national school lunch program ( nslp ) .
the schools participating in the program had to offer lunches that included one serving each of milk , meat or a meat alternate ( such as peanut butter ) , and bread or a bread alternate ( such as pasta ) and at least two servings of vegetables and / or fruits .
all reported differences between subgroups of respondents ( e.g. , cafeteria managers in urban versus rural schools ) , unless otherwise stated , are statistically significant .
specifically , we agreed to survey a random sample of cafeteria managers in the public schools nationwide that participate in the program to obtain the managers' perceptions on the ( 1 ) extent to which plate waste is a problem , ( 2 ) amount of plate waste by type of food , and ( 3 ) reasons for and ways to reduce plate waste .
some concerns have been raised about the amount of food provided in the school lunch program that students throw away .
we also agreed to determine whether the perceptions of managers differed by their school's level ( elementary , middle , or high school ) , their school's location ( urban , suburban , or rural ) , and the proportion of their school's lunches served free and at a reduced price .
to help address these concerns , you asked us to study plate waste in the nslp .
this discarded food is commonly referred to as plate waste .
our survey results represent the views of cafeteria managers in about 80 percent of the 81,911 public schools nationwide that participated in the nslp in the 1993-94 school year , the latest year for which a comprehensive list of public schools was available .
in addition , we agreed to ask cafeteria managers about their level of satisfaction with the federal commodities used in the nslp .

sampling error must be considered when interpreting differences between subgroups , such as urban and rural schools .
