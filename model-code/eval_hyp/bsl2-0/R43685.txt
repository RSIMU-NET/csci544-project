congress remains deeply involved in efforts to increase pit production capacity .
congress has been deeply involved for decades in setting policy , providing funding , and supporting or rejecting programs for the nuclear weapons enterprise .
for example , it established the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a semi - autonomous component of the department of energy ( doe ) that manages the nuclear weapons program ; established the nuclear weapons council , a joint nnsa - department of defense ( dod ) agency that coordinates nuclear weapons programs ; rejected a major facility to manufacture a key nuclear weapon component ; initiated and later rejected the reliable replacement warhead ; and directed nnsa , the government accountability office , and others to conduct studies on nuclear weapon issues .
 ( war reserve ( wr ) pits are those judged acceptable for use in the nuclear stockpile .
without answers to these questions , congress cannot know whether existing buildings , without modifications , could manufacture 80 ppy ; or if modest upgrades would suffice ; or if major construction would be needed to augment capacity .
the house appropriations committee recommended a substantial increase in funding "for a robust experimental effort in fiscal year 2015 to better understand the properties of plutonium and ensure the nnsa can support certification requirements for pit reuse as an option for future [nuclear weapon life extension programs]. .
while 80 ppy has been beyond reach for a quarter - century , the debate over that capacity would take on added salience to the extent that it moves within the realm of feasibility .
over time , however , various factors will affect availability and requirements .
also in 2013 , a national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) document stated , "preliminary plans call for pit production of potentially up to 80 pits per year starting as early as fy 2030. .
as of june 2014 , nnsa had the capacity to manufacture about 10 non - war reserve pits per year in pf - 4 .
while u.s. policy is not to build new - design nuclear weapons for new missions , some argue that the capacity to manufacture new pits may be needed to extend the service life of certain existing weapons , to replace pits in deployed weapons that develop pit problems unexpectedly , and to hedge against possible geopolitical surprises .
that debate is beyond the scope of this report , which focuses on how to achieve a capacity of 80 ppy because that is the high end of dod's range .
some favor a capacity of greater than 80 ppy , while others argue that a lower number would suffice .
specifically , regardless of what capacity is needed , and when , congress and the administration will need to decide among options .
other pits are manufactured for such purposes as development or process qualification. ) .
the committee also recommended $35.7 million for moving certain activities out of the chemistry and metallurgy research building ( described below ) , which became operational in 1952 .
the schedule for ramping up pit production is uncertain .
while dod has a requirement for up to 80 ppy , some key questions about how to manufacture at that rate remain not only unanswered but also unasked .
