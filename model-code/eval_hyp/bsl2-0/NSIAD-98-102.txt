as agreed with your office , this report ( 1 ) describes the processes nasa used to assess the safety and environmental risks associated with the cassini mission , ( 2 ) describes nasa's efforts to consider the use of a non - nuclear power source for the cassini mission , ( 3 ) identifies the federal investment associated with the development of non - nuclear power sources for deep space missions , and ( 4 ) identifies nasa's planned future nuclear - powered space missions .
the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) launched its nuclear - powered cassini spacecraft on october 15 , 1997 , on a 12-year mission to saturn .
you asked that we review the use of nuclear power systems for cassini and other space missions .
on december 11 , 1997 , we briefed your staff on the results of our work .
this report discusses and updates the information presented at that briefing .
federal regulations implementing the national environmental policy act of 1969 required nasa to prepare an environmental impact statement for the cassini mission .
future spacecraft with more efficient electrical systems and reduced demands for electrical power , when coupled with the advanced nuclear - fueled generators , will require significantly less plutonium dioxide fuel .
to meet the requirements nasa conducted quantitative analyses of the types of accidents that could cause a release of plutonium dioxide from the rtgs and the possible health effects that could result from such releases .
in addition to the analyses of potential environmental impacts and health effects , the document included and responded to public comments on nasa's analyses .
the agencies are continuing to invest in improving both solar and nuclear spacecraft power generation systems .
for example , in fiscal year 1998 , nasa and dod will invest $10 million for research and development of advanced solar array systems , and nasa will invest $10 million for research and development of advanced nuclear - fueled systems .
nasa also used doe's rtg safety analyses and air force safety analyses of the titan iv / centaur rocket , which launched the cassini spacecraft .
also , federal regulations implementing the national environmental policy act of 1969 required nasa to assess the environmental and public health impacts of potential accidents during the cassini mission that could cause plutonium dioxide to be released from the spacecraft's rtgs or heater units .
according to nasa and doe officials , spacecraft carrying much smaller amounts of radioactive fuel will reduce human health risks because it is anticipated that less plutonium dioxide could potentially be released in the event of an accident .
the fiscal year 1998 budget of $10 million for solar array systems exceeds the estimated 30-year average annual funding level of $6 million ( not adjusted for inflation ) .
to obtain the necessary presidential approval to launch space missions carrying large amounts of radioactive material , such as cassini , nasa is also required to convene an interagency review of the nuclear safety risks posed by the mission .
over the long term , limitations inherent to solar array technology will preclude its use on many deep space missions .
before launching a spacecraft carrying radioactive materials , regulations implementing federal environmental laws require the sponsoring agency , in this instance nasa , to assess and mitigate the potential risks and effects of an accidental release of radioactive materials during the mission .
