because of your particular interest in the use of impact evaluations as a way of determining program effectiveness , our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe the value of conducting impact evaluations , ( 2 ) describe their current use in evaluating selected early childhood education and care programs , and ( 3 ) discuss the value of other types of early childhood education and care studies the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) and education currently promote and sponsor .
to understand the use of impact evaluations , we reviewed current government - sponsored studies ( both agency - initiated and congressionally mandated ) of 11 programs that fund early childhood education and care and report serving 25,000 or more children younger than age 5 .
thus , we examined current evaluations and evaluation proposals for two programs focused on early childhood education — head start and even start — and for the following nine programs: child care and development fund ( ccdf ) , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , twenty - first century community learning centers , three special education programs ( state , preschool , and infant and toddler grants ) , social services block grant ( ssbg ) , migrant education , and title i .
given the large federal investment and the current attention on the importance of early childhood experiences , policymakers are interested in the effectiveness of federally funded early childhood education and care efforts and the types of research designs available for determining whether these programs are meeting their objectives for children .
in 1999 , at least $9 billion in federal funds supported early education and care services for children younger than 5 .
these funds provided a variety of services and support to children and their families to meet a range of goals , from increasing low - income families' access to affordable child care to ensuring that children's educational , health , and social needs are met .
these nine programs provide early childhood education and care though , for most , it is not a primary activity .
we conducted our work between october 2000 and march 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
both of these programs are intended to improve children's school readiness and educational and developmental outcomes , for example by encouraging enhanced literacy .
in both authorizing and reauthorizing legislation , the congress has required evaluations of a program or demonstration program .
impact evaluations are also used in other areas to assess program effectiveness .
gpra shifted the focus of accountability for federal programs from inputs , such as staffing and activity levels , to outcomes .
1 ) .
the passage of the government performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993 influenced how agencies assess the effectiveness of their programs .
3 ) .
the congress has mandated studies to ensure that agencies conduct the kinds of evaluations it deems necessary .
the other programs we reviewed fund early childhood education and care in various ways but often have primary goals that are only indirectly related to children or school readiness .
while gpra requires agencies to measure the outcomes of their programs , it does not require agencies to conduct formal program evaluations such as impact evaluations .
