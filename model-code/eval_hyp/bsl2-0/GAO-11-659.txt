by rule , fcc extended the advertising restrictions to direct broadcast satellite providers ( satellite providers ) .
this report discusses ( 1 ) the trends in children's programming since cta was implemented , ( 2 ) fcc's efforts to enforce the act , and ( 3 ) the extent to which parents value and use core children's programming .
cta required the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to ( 1 ) initiate and complete a rulemaking proceeding to prescribe standards regulating commercial advertising transmitted during children's television programs , ( 2 ) limit the duration of advertising that may be shown during children's television programs , and ( 3 ) consider the extent to which a broadcast station has served the educational and informational needs of children through its overall programming when reviewing a station's application to continue broadcasting .
congress enacted title i of the children's television act of 1990 ( cta ) to shield children from excessive advertising by commercial broadcast stations and to help ensure that broadcast television met its public service obligations to children by ensuring that some television was educational and informational .
the advertising provisions apply to cable operators as well as commercial over - the - air broadcasters .
in light of the significant role that television programming plays in the lives of young viewers , you asked us to examine the status of the act , including fcc's efforts to enforce it as well as how fcc provides information on children's programming to parents who may wish to use it to help plan their family television viewing .
in recent years , the number of stations has grown and the transition to digital television has further increased the number of channels available to viewers .
studies show that people's viewing of television has also grown , including children's viewing .
to obtain information about fcc's efforts to implement and enforce cta , we reviewed relevant statutes and fcc rules related to commercial broadcast stations , cable operators , and satellite providers , as well as available fcc data on violations and civil penalties it issued .
to obtain information about the trends in children's programming since the act was implemented , we conducted a trend analysis of children's programming in eight designated market areas ( dma ) of different sizes to determine changes in the availability of core children's programming between 1998 and 2010 .
the television industry has continued to evolve since the advent of broadcast television in the 1940s and 1950s .
we did not include programming aired by non - commercial broadcast stations , such as public broadcasting service ( pbs ) member stations , in our analysis of core children's programming because non - commercial broadcast stations are not required to report the same data and thus comparable data were not available .
we also interviewed personnel from commercial and non - commercial broadcast stations in five of these eight dmas: dallas - fort worth , texas ; san diego , california ; grand rapids - kalamazoo - battle creek , michigan ; spokane , washington ; and charleston , south carolina as well as personnel from various industry stakeholders , including representatives of industry associations , television networks specializing in children's programming , and providers of syndicated children's programming .
