traveling in beijing , secretary of state hillary rodham clinton stated to reporters that lee's steps were "prudent and entirely appropriate," and that president obama had directed u.s. government agencies to review their existing authorities and policies related to north korea , "to ensure that we have adequate measures in place , and to identify areas where adjustments would be appropriate. .
 ( see " legislation in the 111 th congress " below for a selection of related congressional actions. ) .
south korea , backed by the united states and japan , has taken the case before the united nations security council .
when asked whether north korea would be returned to the terrorism list , secretary clinton said that the state department "continually reviews north korea's actions" to determine its actions meet the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism .
as discussed below , for years , there have been reports from a variety of sources of similar arms shipments from north korea .
ever since the bush administration's october 2008 removal of north korea from the u.s. state sponsors of terrorism list , a series of actions by north korea have led to calls for the obama administration to return pyongyang to the list .
the kaesong industrial park accounts for a significant share of north - south trade , so if the complex's operations continue to operate as before , it is unclear how much direct , practical effect the measures will have .
in the spring of 2010 , these calls intensified due to two developments .
 ( see " new reports of support of terrorist groups ." ) .
exceptions were made for humanitarian aid to infants and children , and for the north - south korean industrial complex outside of kaesong , north korea , where over 100 south korean manufacturers employ over 40,000 north korean workers .
the second development was the appearance of reports , largely from israeli sources , that a reshipment of north korean rockets and rocket - propelled grenades that were seized in thailand in december 2009 were ultimately destined for hamas and / or hezbollah .
on may 24 , 2010 , south korean president lee myung - bak also announced that north korean ships would no longer be permitted to pass through shipping lanes under south korean control , and that north - south trade , visits , and exchanges generally would be suspended .
the list identifies any country the government of which the secretary of state determines "has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. .
he said that there is a "never - ending" process of reviewing whether to re - list north korea , and that the administration "will not hesitate to take action" if the department determines that north korea has taken actions that "demonstrate a consistent support for international terrorism. .
in the spring and early summer of 2010 , the state department appeared to deem these reports insufficient to place north korea back on the terrorism list .
south korean minister of unification hyun in - taek announced that new investments in the kaesong complex would be stopped and that the number of south korean personnel at the complex — which had often approached 1,000 people in mid - week — would be reduced .
