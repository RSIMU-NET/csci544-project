as you requested , this report provides information on ( 1 ) the profiles of three power marketing administrations , including their similarities and differences and their interactions with the agencies that operate federal water projects ; ( 2 ) the general parameters of the process by which federally owned assets can be sold ; and ( 3 ) the factors that would have to be addressed in a divestiture of federal hydroelectric assets , such as the relationship between power generation and the other purposes of federal water projects .
we agreed to include in our study only the southeastern , southwestern , and western area power administrations .
as agreed with your offices , we are sending copies of this report to the appropriate house and senate committees ; interested members of congress ; the administrators of the southeastern , southwestern , and western area power administrations ; the commissioner , bureau of reclamation ; the director for civil works , u.s. army corps of engineers ; and other interested parties .
major contributors to this report are listed in appendix ix .
if you or your staff have any questions , please call me at ( 202 ) 512-3841 .
this power , which is generated subject to the needs of the project , is sold through five federal power marketing administrations ( pma ) — the southeastern power administration ( southeastern ) , the southwestern power administration ( southwestern ) , and the western area power administration ( western ) as well as the alaska power administration and the bonneville power administration .
the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) licenses and regulates these projects and their hydropower plants that affect the nation's navigable waterways .
it also exempted the divestiture from certain federal laws pertaining to the disposal of surplus federal property and to environmental protection , such as the federal land policy and management act of 1976 , the national environmental policy act of 1969 , the endangered species act of 1973 , and the wild and scenic rivers act of 1968 .
the federal government owns and operates numerous multipurpose water projects , many of which generate electric power .
under provisions of such legislation as the federal power act , as amended by the electric consumers protection act , ferc's licensing and regulatory activities establish the conditions under which the project must operate , consistent with legal and policy developments .
in licensing and relicensing nonfederal hydropower projects , ferc is required to give equal weight to both “developmental factors” ( such as power , irrigation , and flood control ) and “nondevelopmental factors” ( such as protecting fish and wildlife habitat , conserving energy , and providing recreation ) .
these bills have proposed selling only the pma and its assets ; the pma and the related hydropower assets of the bureau and the corps ; or all of these assets plus the related dams and reservoirs .
by law , the pmas give preference in the sale of federal power to public bodies and cooperatives ( called “preference customers” ) , such as federal agencies , irrigation districts , municipalities , public utility districts , and other public agencies .
despite the enactment of laws in 1995 and 1996 to authorize this transaction , the sale of the hydropower assets from which the alaska power administration markets its power has not been completed , in part because of the need to resolve issues related to rights - of - way and easements .
