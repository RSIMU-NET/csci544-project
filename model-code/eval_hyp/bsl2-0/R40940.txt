some u.s. policy - makers and others have expressed frustration that china's policy of providing economic assistance "without conditions" has undermined the ability of other aid donors to influence the behaviors of aid recipients in such areas as democracy , human rights , and economic reforms .
many observers have praised chinese assistance and investment as filling unmet development needs , particularly in countries that have been relatively neglected by major bilateral and multilateral aid providers .
some observers have argued that chinese financing has burdened some developing countries with too much debt .
others have criticized china for not promoting democracy , equitable and sustainable development , and environmental preservation in these countries .
china has garnered considerable international goodwill through financing infrastructure and natural resource development projects , assisting in the execution of such projects , and backing prc state enterprise ventures in many developing countries .
in recent years , the people's republic of china ( prc ) has bolstered its diplomatic presence and economic influence , often referred to as "soft power," in the developing world .
prc officials have responded that they are contributing to basic development and suggest that they are taking a flexible , "long - term view" of recipient countries' abilities to repay loans .
this report examines china's "economic assistance" — a term that encompasses a mix of development aid , loans , technical assistance , and state - sponsored investments — in africa , latin america , and southeast asia .
southeast asia's largest sources of fdi in 2006 ( net inflow ) were the eu ( $13.3 billion ) , japan ( $10.8 billion ) , the united states ( $3.8 billion ) , south korea ( $1 billion ) , and china ( $900 million ) .
a relatively small portion of chinese economic assistance includes what typically is characterized as "official development assistance" ( oda ) as provided by the world's major aid donors , such as development grants , poverty - reduction programs , humanitarian assistance , and food aid .
china also provides relatively little military and security - related assistance .
prc foreign assistance is difficult to quantify .
by contrast , the foreign aid programs of the united states and other oecd members , with some exceptions , involve fewer direct economic linkages .
estimates of china's foreign aid vary widely due to the lack of official data and to disparate definitions of aid .
some analysts surmise that the chinese leadership is reluctant to be perceived as a major aid donor , since the prc itself continues to be a recipient of foreign assistance and because the government fears that its citizens may object to lavish spending on economic projects abroad .
the united states' foreign operations budget ( bilateral development ; economic , security , and military assistance ; multilateral assistance ; and food aid ) was estimated at $24 billion in fy2008 .
beijing reportedly has taken some tentative steps toward making its foreign aid process more centralized and transparent , coordinating its programs with other aid providers , and offering more development - oriented assistance , while continuing to eschew the label of major oda donor .
