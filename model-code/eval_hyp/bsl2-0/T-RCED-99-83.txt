this increased the coast guard's total fiscal year 1999 funding to about $4.3 billion .
for fiscal year 2000 , the coast guard is requesting $4.1 billion to fund its various programs .
the program , called the deepwater replacement project , may cost as much as $9.8 billion ( in constant 1998 dollars ) over the next 20 years and is potentially the largest acquisition project in the agency's history .
my testimony today , which is based on gao's recently completed and ongoing work at the coast guard , addresses three topics: ( 1 ) the coast guard's progress in justifying the deepwater replacement project and addressing our concerns about its affordability , ( 2 ) the coast guard's plans for spending its fiscal year 1999 emergency funds , and ( 3 ) the budget strategies the agency may have to consider in the future to address continuing budget constraints .
it received another $377 million in emergency funding to pay for additional equipment and operations , most of which was for expanding its anti - drug efforts .
during the last 2 years , we have issued reports on the overall fiscal challenges facing the coast guard and the justification and the affordability associated with its multi - billion dollar program for replacing or modernizing many of its ships and aircraft .
typically , the coast guard has adopted a budget strategy that relies heavily on cost - cutting initiatives to improve operating efficiency .
our work has shown that additional cost - cutting measures to improve efficiency are possible , and the coast guard should renew its efforts in this area .
for fiscal year 1999 , the coast guard initially received $3.9 billion in appropriated funds to carry out its missions .
for example , using civilian personnel rather than military personnel in administrative support positions could achieve significant cost - savings .
however , given the potential size of the increased funding requirements , the adequacy of this approach to meet the sterner budget challenges is highly uncertain .
the agency might have to look for other cost - cutting options , including rethinking its missions and services performed , which is likely to be controversial , given past opposition to reductions in this agency's services .
in summary , our work shows the following: while the coast guard has made progress in addressing our concerns about the justification and the affordability of the deepwater project , additional work is needed .
in the future , the agency might have to develop different budget strategies and approaches to live within its budget .
the additional funding that will likely be needed to modernize and acquire deepwater aircraft , ships , and equipment and to sustain the newly expanded anti - drug efforts will increase the budget pressures on the coast guard .
the coast guard , an agency within the department of transportation ( dot ) , is responsible for maritime missions that range from search and rescue operations to the enforcement of fisheries , immigration , and drug laws .
as directed by the congress , it has begun buying more patrol boats ; reactivating its surveillance aircraft and ships ; and obtaining additional equipment , such as sensors and communications systems , to improve its ability to detect drug smugglers and to coordinate its anti - drug activities .
