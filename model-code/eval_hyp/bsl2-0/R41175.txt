these negotiations yielded the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) in 1992 .
the protocol has not been submitted to the u.s. senate for its advice and consent to ratification .
although , in 2001 , president george w. bush announced that the united states would not become a party to the protocol , most other countries approved it , and it entered into force for its parties on february 16 , 2005 .
the unfccc does not set binding targets for greenhouse gas ( "ghg" ) emissions .
nevertheless , the united states signed the kyoto protocol on november 12 , 1998 .
prior to the conclusion of the protocol on december 11 , 1997 , the senate adopted a resolution expressing the view that the united states should not sign any agreement at kyoto that would either commit developed , but not developing , nations to reduce or limit ghg emissions by a certain date or do "serious harm" to the u.s. economy .
it establishes quantitative emission reduction targets for the high income countries listed in the protocol's annex b and market - based mechanisms , including emissions trading , for achieving those targets .
the protocol and decisions adopted under it also establish an elaborate compliance system .
the kyoto protocol to the unfccc ( the protocol ) was negotiated as the first step towards implementing the unfccc .
in doing so , the parties established two tracks for negotiation: ( 1 ) a track by which kyoto protocol parties would pursue an amendment to the protocol for a "second round" of emission targets for annex i parties , and ( 2 ) a track by which unfccc parties would seek agreement on ghg mitigation targets or actions for all parties .
recognizing that the emissions reductions for the kyoto protocol were set for a period that would end in 2012 , the 2007 un climate change conference in bali adopted the "bali road map" as a framework for negotiations over the post - 2012 climate regime .
formal international negotiations to address human - driven climate change were launched in december 1990 .
most unfccc parties appeared willing to adopt the accord , but adoption was blocked by bolivia , cuba , sudan , and venezuela .
the united states submitted its note verbale to the executive secretary of the unfccc on january 28 , 2010 with a voluntary ghg emissions reduction target of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 .
those napas for which international support is provided are subject to international measurement , reporting , and verification requirements .
the u.s. senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of the agreement that same year .
consequently , the copenhagen accord ( the accord ) is the product of negotiations among a much smaller group of countries , including the united states , china , india , brazil , and south africa .
seventy - six of the 193 countries represented at the copenhagen conference , including china , india , brazil , indonesia , and south africa , have submitted ghg emissions targets or , as appropriate , napas to the executive secretary of the unfccc .
the unfccc provides a structure for international consideration of climate change .
