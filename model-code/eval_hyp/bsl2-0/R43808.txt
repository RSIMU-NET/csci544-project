those who favor a stronger ac emphasis believe that replacing too many or certain types of ac units with rc units is not cost - effective and could reduce the army's ability to respond rapidly to an overseas crisis and sustain operations over time .
the army's rc is made up of both the army national guard ( arng ) and the united states army reserve ( usar ) .
although specific force mix recommendations can be nuanced , policy advocates generally divide between those who favor a stronger ac emphasis and those who favor a stronger rc emphasis .
the army is composed of both an active component ( ac ) and a reserve component ( rc ) .
in the contemporary debate , those who favor a stronger rc emphasis believe that rc units can replace a portion of ac force structure while saving money .
ac / rc force mix refers to the distribution of units among the active and reserve components of the armed forces .
debates over ac / rc mix center on whether to shift force structure between the ac and the rc and , if so , what types of units to shift .
of these , utilization , readiness , effectiveness , cost , and risk are generally considered the major elements in developing the ac / rc force mix .
these factors are all linked to the ability of the specified military forces to meet national security requirements in a budget constrained environment .
those who take this perspective believe that replacing too many or certain types of ac units with rc units could reduce the army's ability to respond rapidly to an overseas crisis and sustain operations over time ; or could require too much additional rc funding and training time to make it cost - effective .
others believe that certain rc forces — particularly larger direct combat units and higher echelon headquarters — are not as capable as ac forces without substantial additional preparation ; cannot respond to a crisis as rapidly as ac forces ; and cannot be used with the same frequency and duration as ac forces due to policy limitations .
determining the appropriate mix of ac and rc forces is complex , with many factors affecting the process .
they are not necessarily mutually exclusive ; congress could elect to pursue some combination of the following options: support administration proposals on what the proper mix of army ac and rc units should be ; gather additional information on key factors that contribute to ac / rc mix decisions ; directly adjust ac / rc mix ; and / or influence ac / rc mix by adjusting factors that contribute to mix decisions .
however , there are other factors often considered with respect to ac / rc mix , particularly with respect to the national guard .
as congress considers the future ac / rc mix for the army , there are several approaches it may wish to consider .
there are also those who believe the current mix is about right , and still others who advocate shifting certain types of units between the ac and rc — for example , moving more combat units to the ac and more support units to the rc , or reallocating some units between the ac and the rc based on their comparative costs — which may or may not result in changes to the relative size of the components .
