this bill included a provision that further increased taxes on major integrated oil companies by extending the depreciation recovery period for geological and geophysical costs from two to five years ( thus taking back some of the benefits enacted under the 2005 law ) .

in theory , energy taxes and subsidies , like tax policy instruments in general , are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some social , economic ( efficiency , equity , or even macroeconomic ) , environmental , or fiscal objective .
