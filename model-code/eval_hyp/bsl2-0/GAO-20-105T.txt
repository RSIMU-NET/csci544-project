under the apa , agencies engage in three basic phases of the rulemaking process: ( 1 ) initiate rulemaking actions , ( 2 ) develop proposed rulemaking actions , or notices of proposed rulemaking ( nprm ) , and ( 3 ) develop final rulemaking actions .
agencies use regulations to carry out statutory directives to achieve public policy goals , such as protecting the health and safety of the public .
most agencies utilize regulations.gov to receive public comments on proposed rules , but some agencies have their own agency - specific websites .
for example , during the public comment period for the federal communications commission's ( fcc ) 2017 restoring internet freedom nprm , fcc received more than 22 million comments through its public comment website .
built into agencies' rulemaking processes are opportunities for internal and external deliberations , reviews , and public comments .
the administrative procedure act ( apa ) establishes procedures for rulemaking , which is the process agencies follow to develop and issue regulations .
although the number of public comments submitted on nprms can vary widely , in recent years some high - profile rulemakings have received extremely large numbers of comments .
federal agencies publish an average of 3,700 nprms each year .
the apa requires agencies to allow comments on nprms to be submitted by any interested party ( commenters ) .
specifically , this testimony discusses ( 1 ) the identity information selected agencies collect through regulations.gov and agency - specific comment websites , ( 2 ) the internal guidance selected agencies have related to the identity of commenters , ( 3 ) how selected agencies treat identity information collected during the public comment process , and ( 4 ) the extent to which selected agencies clearly communicate their practices associated with posting identity information collected during the public comment process .
these selected agencies included eight agencies that use regulations.gov as their agency's comment website ( “participating agencies” ) and two agencies that operate agency - specific comment websites ( “nonparticipating agencies” ) .
however , courts have held that agencies are not required to respond to every comment individually .
the apa does not require the disclosure of identity information from commenters , such as name , email , or address .
agencies therefore have no obligation under the apa to verify the identity of such parties during the rulemaking process .
subsequently , media and others reported that some of the comments submitted to fcc were suspected to have been submitted using false identity information .
agencies must give consideration to any significant comments submitted during the comment period when drafting the final rule .
for our report , we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 10 agencies ( selected agencies ) that received a high volume of public comments for rulemaking proceedings that accepted comments from january 1 , 2013 , through december 31 , 2017 .
agencies routinely offer a single response to multiple identical or similar comments , because the comment process is not a vote .
as explained by regulations.gov's tips for submitting effective comments , “… agencies make determinations for a proposed action based on sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes .
