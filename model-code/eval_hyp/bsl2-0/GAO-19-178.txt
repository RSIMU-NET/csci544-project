this limits congressional efforts to ensure accountability for these costs .
we previously reported on certain costs of presidential travel during the administrations of former presidents barack obama and bill clinton .
the united states secret service ( secret service ) is responsible for protecting the president and his family , including the adult children of the president , unless they decline such protection .
at the request of the secret service , assistance must be provided by other agencies , such as dod and the united states coast guard ( coast guard ) .
we also did not include certain classified cost information or information about federal funds provided to local law enforcement by the federal emergency management agency .
these memoranda also note that even though presidential travel may not be official , there are certain individuals who are required , in the performance of their official duties , to accompany the president when he travels ; therefore their costs are to be paid from appropriated funds .
department of justice memoranda have advised that when presidential travel is for official purposes it is to be paid for with government funds , and when it is for political purposes , appropriated funds cannot be used .
the president flies on military aircraft provided by the department of defense ( dod ) on all trips , regardless of the type of travel: official , political , or other non - official purposes .
we also interviewed officials from dod , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the department of justice .
we reviewed laws , regulations , and policies to identify the rules and processes governing agencies that support presidential travel and agency costs on employee per diem and operational spaces for employees who accompany the president when he is traveling domestically .
as we examined the costs incurred for the president's travel , we did not include the salaries and benefits , including overtime , of u.s. government civilian and military personnel traveling with the president or involved with agency travel preparations , since these personnel would have received their salaries and benefits for the conduct of their regular duties and responsibilities regardless of whether the president traveled .
otherwise , all assistance that executive departments and agencies provide to the secret service in the performance of its duties must be reimbursed by the secret service .
under the presidential protection assistance act of 1976 , as amended , the secret service does not reimburse dod or the coast guard for assistance provided on a temporary basis when the duties are directly related to the protection of the president , the vice president , or other officer immediately next in order of succession to the office of the president .
