however , not all federal programs are administered by federal agencies .
we expressed continued concerns about challenges faced by these agencies in our 2019 high - risk report .
such improvements would be consistent with the expressed view of congress as to the federal government's trust responsibilities and would strengthen confidence in the performance and accountability of the federal government .
we added this area to our high - risk list in february 2017 because of our concern about the ability of agencies within these departments to manage ( 1 ) education and health care programs that serve tribes and their members and ( 2 ) indian energy resources .
in particular , our prior work found numerous weaknesses in how interior's bureau of indian education ( bie ) and bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) — under the office of the assistant secretary - indian affairs ( indian affairs ) — managed education and energy resources and how hhs's indian health service ( ihs ) managed health care services .
we reported that these management weaknesses jeopardized the health and safety of american indians served by these programs and limited opportunities for tribes and their members to use energy resources to create economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities .
my statement today , which is largely based on our march 2019 high - risk series: substantial efforts needed to achieve greater progress on high - risk areas , will address actions taken and progress made by these agencies to address the five criteria we use for determining whether to remove a high - risk designation ( leadership commitment , capacity , action plan , monitoring , and demonstrated progress ) .
the focus of this high - risk area is on management weaknesses within federal agencies that administer programs that serve tribes and their members .
overall , as of march 2019 , 31 recommendations remain open .
the act notes that this history of federal - tribal relations and understandings has benefitted the people of the united states and established “enduring and enforceable ederal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.” agencies can improve the efficiency of federal programs under which services are provided to tribes and their members by making improvements to their management and oversight of such programs .
in 2016 , congress found in the indian trust asset reform act that “through treaties , statutes , and historical relations with indian tribes , the united states has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support indian tribes and indians.” as further stated in that act , the fiduciary responsibilities of the united states to indians arise in part from commitments made in treaties and agreements , in exchange for which indians surrendered claims to vast tracts of land .
in accordance with federal indian policy that recognizes the right of indian tribes to self - government and that supports tribal self - determination , a number of tribes have elected to take over the administration of certain federal programs and services from bia , bie , and ihs .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of actions by the departments of the interior ( interior ) and health and human services ( hhs ) to address issues that led to the high - risk designation we made related to the federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members .
