because of their concerns over the potential anticompetitive impacts of these proposed alliances , the departments of justice ( doj ) and transportation ( dot ) are reviewing them , and you and other members of congress have announced your intention to review them as well .
critics , however , say that this consolidation will undermine the benefits of deregulation by decreasing competition , which will ultimately reduce passengers' choices and increase fares .
in my testimony , i will describe the competitive implications of the proposed alliances , including ( 1 ) their potential benefits to consumers , ( 2 ) their potential harm to consumers , and ( 3 ) the issues that policymakers need to consider in evaluating the net effects of the proposed alliances .
the airlines say that these alliances will produce such consumer benefits as expanded route networks and combined frequent flier programs .
to evaluate these alliances , decisionmakers will have to determine whether the potential benefits to consumers from these alliances will exceed the potential harm .
now , the six airlines that carry about 70 percent of domestic passengers have announced plans to form three alliances .
airline officials also predict that increased frequencies and connection opportunities will spur additional demand , allowing for even more frequent flights and additional destinations .
these airline pairs are northwest airlines and continental airlines , delta air lines and united airlines , and american airlines and us airways .
these potentially negative impacts would be partially offset by potential benefits to about 30 million passengers on the 338 routes where two alliance partners could combine to compete with other airlines on those routes .
these include whether the alliances may exacerbate or ameliorate fare and service problems being reported by business travelers and certain small and medium - sized communities ; the impact that the proposed alliances may have on international travelers ; and , should some combination or all of the proposed alliances go forward , the overall implications for competition in the airline industry from this substantial restructuring .
at your request , we have just begun to evaluate the potential impact of these alliances , and today we can offer some preliminary results of our work .
our prior work has shown that the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 has generally been successful , resulting in lower fares and better service for most air travelers , largely because it increased competition , with both the entry of new airlines into the industry and the movement of established airlines into new markets .
if all three alliances occur , we found that the number of independent airlines could decline on 1,836 of the 5,000 most frequently traveled domestic airline routes ( which account for over 90 percent of the total u.s. domestic traffic ) and potentially reduce competition for about 100 million of the 396 million domestic passengers per year .
the primary potential benefits of the proposed alliances for consumers , according to airline officials , are the additional destinations and frequencies that occur when alliance partners join route networks by code - sharing .
we will continue to study the competitive implications of these alliances for the full committee and this subcommittee and report on the results of our review in more detail later this year .
