a primary user of these codes is medicare , the federal health care program for elderly and disabled individuals administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
on october 1 , 2015 , cms plans to require all hipaa - covered entities to transition from the 9th revision ( icd - 9 ) to the 10th revision ( icd - 10 ) of the icd codes .
this transition requires cms and its medicare stakeholders to modify their information technology systems that use icd codes when processing medicare fee - for - service claims for payment of health care bills .
these entities include health care providers , health care clearinghouses , and health insurers ( referred to as “stakeholders” in this report ) that submit medicare fee - for - service claims .
cms is responsible for enforcing the use of the icd codes by all entities throughout the united states that are covered by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) .
this report addresses: the status of cms's effort to implement changes needed to be made to its systems to process medicare claims that include icd - 10 codes ; the extent to which cms's testing and verification actions are sufficient to ensure changes to its systems have been made to process medicare claims that include icd - 10 codes by october 1 , 2015 ; steps cms is taking to ensure that health care insurers , providers , and other entities have access to the technical support , tools , and other resources needed to identify , develop , and test system modifications , and to process medicare claims that include icd - 10 codes if needed system changes have not been made ; and what is known about estimated costs to cms , insurers , and providers .
we also included within our scope of work the stakeholders that use systems to process , store , and transmit claims for payment of medicare services , such as providers , insurers , and health care clearinghouses .
in conducting this study , we focused on cms's activities to develop and test changes that needed to be made to its internal medicare fee - for - service claims processing systems in order to process icd - 10 codes .
this included additional costs incurred as a result of delaying the transition until october 1 , 2015 .
further , we collected from cms and health care professional associations any data that reflected any knowledge of estimated costs that have been incurred by the agency and its stakeholders for the development , testing , and implementation of necessary system changes made to medicare claims submission and processing systems needed to be made to support the icd - 10 transition .
you asked us to study the actions planned and taken by cms to support the transition of covered entities to the revised codes by october 1 , 2015 .
toward this end , we issued the results of a study in january 2015 that examined the agency's efforts to help entities affected by changes to the codes better prepare for the upcoming transition , and described stakeholders' concerns and recommendations regarding cms's activities .
