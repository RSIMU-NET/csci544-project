specifically , agencies must have ( 1 ) a demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support to address the risks ; ( 2 ) a corrective action plan that identifies the root causes , identifies effective solutions , and provides for substantially completing corrective measures in the near term , including but not limited to steps necessary to implement solutions we recommended ; ( 3 ) the capacity ( that is , the people and other resources ) to resolve the risks ; ( 4 ) a program instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures ; and ( 5 ) the ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures .
dhs has implemented more than 69 percent of these recommendations and has actions under way to address others .
since 2003 , we have made approximately 2,200 recommendations to dhs to strengthen program management , performance measurement efforts , and management processes , among other things .
in 2003 , we designated implementing and transforming dhs as high risk because dhs had to transform 22 agencies — several with major management challenges — into one department , and failure to address associated risks could have serious consequences for u.s. national and economic security .
gao , department of homeland security: progress made and work remaining in implementing homeland security missions 10 years after 9 / 11 , gao - 11-881 ( washington , d.c.: sept. 7 , 2011 ) .
in the 12 years since the department's creation , dhs has implemented key homeland security operations , achieved important goals and milestones , and grown to more than 240,000 employees and approximately $60 billion in budget authority .
that continuing weaknesses in dhs's management functions had been a key theme impacting the department's implementation efforts .
as requested , my statement discusses dhs's progress and actions remaining in strengthening and integrating its management functions , and crosscutting issues that have affected dhs's progress in implementing its mission functions .
we also reported in our 2013 update that the department needs to demonstrate continued progress in implementing and strengthening key management initiatives and addressing corrective actions and outcomes in order to mitigate the risks that management weaknesses pose to mission accomplishment and the efficient and effective use of the department's resources .
in september 2011 , we reported in our assessment of dhs's progress and challenges 10 years after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , ( 9 / 11 ) that the department had implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals in many areas to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential .
since 2003 , the focus of the implementing and transforming dhs high - risk area has evolved in tandem with dhs's maturation and evolution .
given the significant effort required to build and integrate a department as large and complex as dhs , our initial high - risk designation addressed the department's initial transformation and subsequent implementation efforts , to include associated management and programmatic challenges .
while challenges remain for dhs across its range of missions , the department has made considerable progress in transforming its original component agencies into a single cabinet - level department and positioning itself to achieve its full potential .
