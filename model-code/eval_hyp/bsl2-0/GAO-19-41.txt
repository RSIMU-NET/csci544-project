in recent years , states have increased their focus on recovery as part of mental health services , and this has included utilizing peer support specialists .
this report describes ( 1 ) programs for certifying peer support specialists in selected states and ( 2 ) leading practices for certifying peer support specialists identified by program officials in selected states .
specifically , based on its annual survey of behavioral health issues , the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) estimated that 10.4 million adults in 2016 had a serious mental illness ; however , only 6.7 million adults received treatment for these issues in the past year .
the 21st century cures act included a provision for us to conduct a study of peer support specialist programs in states that receive funding from samhsa and identify best practices in these states related to training and credential requirements for peer support specialist programs .
in light of these issues , samhsa officials and other experts have called for using peer support specialists to help address shortages in the behavioral health workforce .
serious mental illnesses — including schizophrenia and bipolar disorders — substantially interfere with a person's major life activities such as maintaining interpersonal relationships and employment .
according to samhsa , workforce shortages are a key driver of the unmet need for behavioral health services ; 55 percent of counties in the united states do not have any practicing behavioral health workers .
further , a recent study covering the period 2008-2014 found that more than 50 percent of adults with co - occurring mental health and substance use disorders ( such as alcohol and opioid use disorders ) received neither mental health care nor substance use treatment in the prior year .
as the peer support specialist workforce continues to grow , there has been increased attention to standardizing the profession through certification .
we selected our sample states using five criteria , specifically ( 1 ) recommendations from samhsa officials , researchers in the field of peer support , and national - level mental health organizations on states with well - established programs ; ( 2 ) samhsa data that indicated that a state had reported using samhsa's community mental health services block grant for peer support generally ; ( 3 ) the age of the state's certification program was at least 2 years old ; ( 4 ) geographic diversity across the united states ; and ( 5 ) the prevalence of serious mental illness among adults in the state .
federal data and academic research show an unmet need for behavioral health services — that is , for services that address mental health or substance use issues .
peer support specialists are individuals who use their own personal , lived experience recovering from mental illnesses to support others in their recovery .
to describe programs for certifying peer support specialists in selected states , we selected six states to illustrate aspects of , and variations in , the certification programs that states have developed for peer support specialists .
a nationwide study found that 41 states and the district of columbia had established programs to train and certify these workers , and two other states were in the process of developing such a program as of july 2016 .
