regime members conduct a number of activities in support of the regimes , including ( 1 ) sharing information about each others' export licensing decisions , including certain export denials and , in some cases , approvals ; ( 2 ) adopting common export control practices and control lists of sensitive equipment and technology into national laws or regulations .
because of your interest in efforts to strengthen the multilateral export control regimes , this report ( 1 ) describes their accomplishments , ( 2 ) assesses their weaknesses , and ( 3 ) identifies obstacles that the united states faces in trying to strengthen them .
the four principal regimes are the australia group , which focuses on trade in chemical and biological items ; the missile technology control regime ( mtcr ) ; the nuclear suppliers group ; and the wassenaar arrangement , which focuses on trade in conventional weapons and related items with both civilian and military ( dual - use ) applications .
regime members agree to restrict such trade through their national laws and regulations , which set up systems to license the exports of sensitive items .
multilateral export control regimes are voluntary , nonbinding arrangements among like - minded supplier countries that aim to restrict trade in sensitive technologies to peaceful purposes .
the advent of global terrorism has heightened concerns about the long - standing threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
the under secretary of state for arms control and international security stated recently that preventing the next wave of terrorist acts requires , above all , effective use , improvement , and enforcement of the multilateral tools at u.s. disposal , including export control regimes .
the united states is a member of all four regimes .
we also reviewed regime documentation , including export denial and approval information , and met with regime representatives in paris , france ( mtcr ) ; vienna , austria ( the nuclear suppliers group and the wassenaar arrangement ) ; and canberra , australia ( the australia group ) .
to address these issues , we reviewed analyses prepared by the departments of state , commerce , defense , and the intelligence community , and studies prepared by nonproliferation specialists in academia .
we also interviewed officials of the governments of australia , austria , canada , france , japan , the netherlands , new zealand , and the united kingdom , and received written responses to questions we provided to the governments of canada , japan , germany , russia , and hong kong .
specifically , we found that regime members do not ( 1 ) share complete and timely export licensing information or ( 2 ) harmonize their export controls promptly to accord with regime decisions .
we identified several significant weaknesses in the activities of the regimes that could limit their ability to curb proliferation .
 ( 2 ) adopt and implement agreed - upon regime changes to export controls more consistently by setting guidelines for when each regime member should adopt control list changes into national laws and regulations and making this information available to all members ; tracking when members adopt regime changes into national law and regulations and making information on the timing and content of these changes available to the membership ; establishing minimal standards for an effective national export control periodically assessing each member's national export control system against these standards and reporting the results of these assessments to the regime ; ( 3 ) identify potential changes in policies and procedures by assessing alternative processes for reaching decisions , evaluating means for encouraging greater adherence to regime conducting an annual self - assessment of regime effectiveness .
