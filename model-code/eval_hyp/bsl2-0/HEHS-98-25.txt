because of these concerns , you asked us to evaluate the food and drug administration's ( fda ) oversight of transplanted human tissue as well as to evaluate potential safety problems .
specifically , we sought to identify gaps in the current regulation , determining whether and how fda plans to address them in the approach it has proposed for regulating tissue banking .
notwithstanding the benefits of tissue transplantation , some are concerned about the potential transmission of infectious diseases from donor to recipient and about certain tissue - processing techniques that may affect the usefulness of tissues or leave them with harmful residues .
we also did not examine fda's regulation of highly manipulated cellular techniques , such as those used in somatic cell therapies .
our examination of the tissue industry was limited to human tissues that are under fda oversight .
we examined fda's regulation of human tissue intended for transplantation , the agency's december 1995 draft document on the regulation of placental and umbilical cord blood stem cell products intended for transplantation , and the agency's proposed approach for the regulation of cellular and tissue - based products , as well as guidance from fda and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) on screening donors of human tissues .
we did not examine transfusable blood products or other more specialized fda - regulated tissue - related products , such as tissues derived from animals , products used to propagate cells or tissues , or products that are extracted from cells or tissues .
in this report , we provide our findings and recommendations on these topics for musculoskeletal tissue , skin , corneas , reproductive tissue , and peripheral and umbilical cord blood stem cells .
additionally , transplanting reproductive tissue allows infertile couples to bear children .
these transplants aid burn victims , the visually impaired , and persons living with cancer , heart defects , and various other illnesses and injuries .
we also collected information on state regulations and trade association standards and reviewed them for variations and gaps between federal , state , and private entities in the oversight of human tissue .
we obtained information on fda's guidance on inspections for human tissue , summaries of findings on inspections , and memoranda relating to tissue donation and viral testing of donors .
we met with officials from fda and all the relevant industry associations to obtain their views on the regulation of tissue banking .
each year human tissue transplants allow approximately 600,000 americans to live fuller and healthier lives .
we interviewed representatives of and made site visits to the full complement of the types of tissue facilities within the scope of our study , including musculoskeletal facilities and processors , eye facilities , reproductive facilities , and facilities that collect , process , store , or transplant peripheral and umbilical cord blood stem cells .
we observed tissue processing and infectious disease controls and reviewed documents relating to donor screening and standard operating procedures .
the approach would focus on three main areas: ( 1 ) preventing unwitting use of contaminated tissues with the potential for transmitting infectious diseases , ( 2 ) preventing improper handling and processing that might contaminate or damage tissues , and ( 3 ) ensuring that clinical safety and efficacy are demonstrated for tissues that are highly processed ( more than minimally manipulated ) , used for other than their normal function ( nonhomologous ) , combined with nontissue components , or used for metabolic purposes .
