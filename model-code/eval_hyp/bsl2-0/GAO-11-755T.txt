these agencies included the department of the interior's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) , bureau of land management ( blm ) , bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , u.s .
fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , and national park service ( nps ) ; the department of agriculture's u.s. forest service ; the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) ; and the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) .
in july 2010 , we reported on the implementation of nagpra by eight key federal agencies with significant historical collections .
the national museum of the american indian act ( nmai act ) and the native american graves protection and repatriation act ( nagpra ) were enacted , in 1989 and 1990 respectively , in part to address these concerns .
these human remains and cultural objects have long been a concern for many indian tribes and native hawaiian communities , who have been determined to provide an appropriate resting place for their ancestors .
the acts generally require the smithsonian institution and federal agencies to take certain actions to identify the indian and native hawaiian human remains and cultural objects in their collections , affiliate those remains and objects to a tribe , and upon request repatriate the items to the tribes .
similarly the smithsonian institution has acquired its collections since its establishment in 1846 .
many federal agencies have acquired thousands of indian human remains , funerary objects , sacred objects , and objects of cultural patrimony over hundreds of years .
our testimony today summarizes the findings of both of these reports and also includes information on some recent actions that the agencies have taken in response to the recommendations we made in our reports .
both of these reports were performance audits that were conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
in may 2011 , we reported on the smithsonian institution's implementation of the nmai act's repatriation requirements as they relate to the collections held by the national museum of the american indian and the national museum of natural history .
i am pleased to be here today to participate in your hearing on federal efforts to repatriate indian and native hawaiian human remains and certain cultural objects .
a detailed description of our scope and methodology is presented in each issued report .
furthermore , while national nagpra has taken several actions to implement the act's requirements , in some cases it has not effectively carried out its responsibilities .
as we reported , the committee's recommendations to facilitate the resolution of disposition requests involving culturally unidentifiable human remains have generally been implemented ( 52 of 61 requests has been fully implemented ) .
finally , although the key agencies have repatriated many nagpra items , repatriation activity has generally not been tracked or reported governmentwide .
we found that the nagpra review committee , to fulfill its responsibilities under nagpra , had monitored federal agency and museum compliance , made recommendations to improve implementation , and assisted the secretary in the development of regulations .
in conclusion , chairman akaka , vice chairman barrasso , and members of the committee , our two studies clearly show that while federal agencies and the smithsonian have made progress in identifying and repatriating thousands of indian human remains and objects , after 2 decades of effort , much work still remains to be done to address the goals of both nagpra and the nmai act .
