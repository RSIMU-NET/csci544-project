by convening the committee specifically to address transportation issues surrounding military growth installations , dod may be able to reach agreement with other federal agencies to meet more of those unmet needs by more fully leveraging federal resources to their best advantage .
this has resulted in an increased interest in the defense access roads ( dar ) program to help mitigate adverse transportation impacts .
while recognizing the importance of the current dod growth initiatives , the house appropriations committee's subcommittee on military construction and veterans affairs expressed concerns about the potential impact on the quality of life and military mission if off - installation transportation infrastructure becomes significantly overburdened due to population increases at growth installations .
nonetheless , a large backlog of unmet transportation needs remains , in part because state and local governments have experienced fiscal pressures that have strained their ability to help fund their share of transportation projects .
for this report , our objectives were ( 1 ) to assess the extent to which the dar program has been used to mitigate defense - related transportation impacts on surrounding communities , and ( 2 ) to identify additional steps that may be necessary to address unmet transportation needs in those impacted communities .
we have also reported previously on federal , state , and local actions to mitigate growth impacts and found that federal monetary support for those defense - affected communities has been limited .
moreover , without a strategy for providing priority assistance and leveraging funding for transportation projects surrounding its dod - growth installations , infrastructure needs both on and off the installation will continue to be subject to funding uncertainties , and both military readiness and the communities' ability to plan to meet the needs of their citizens could suffer .
while it is difficult to determine the magnitude of the unmet needs , we reported in 2009 that communities surrounding 18 military installations expecting brac - related growth had estimated over $2 billion in defense - related transportation needs .
in addition , in february 2009 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 provided another approximately $25.6 billion for state and local highway infrastructure investment projects .
furthermore , unless high - level interagency leadership takes additional steps to improve the utilization of dar — in conjunction with other federal programs that provide funding for transportation projects nationwide — both installations and communities affected by dod growth will continue to struggle to address their transportation needs .
state and local highway agencies are primarily responsible for developing and maintaining public highways that meet normal defense and other transportation needs .
under executive order 12788 , the economic adjustment committee is expected to provide coordinated federal economic adjustment assistance to defense - affected communities .
as of november 2010 , dod officials said that dod had yet to convene the entire economic adjustment committee regarding domestic military growth impacts .
consequently , the subcommittee asked us to review dod's use of the dar program to mitigate defense - generated traffic impacts .
specifically , executive order 12788 provides dod a tool — the 22-agency economic adjustment committee — to help ensure that the federal government effectively and efficiently leverages scarce resources to assist impacted communities .
