ecuador is both geographically and ethnically diverse , and has a relatively long , albeit unstable , experience with democratic rule .

while the united states has concluded free trade agreements ( ftas ) with peru and colombia , negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement with ecuador have been suspended indefinitely in the wake of the dispute with the u.s. firm occidental petroleum .
