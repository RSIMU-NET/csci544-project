this report provides our assessment of whether the ( 1 ) procedures used to conduct the c - 5 competition provided substantially equal opportunity for the public and private offerors to compete for the workload without regard to work performance location , ( 2 ) procedures complied with the requirements of all applicable provisions of law and the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , and ( 3 ) c - 5 award results in the lowest total cost to the department of defense ( dod ) for performance of the workload .
this report responds to one of several reporting requirements contained in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 , relating to depot maintenance activities .
as required , we reviewed the air force's solicitation and selection of a source for c - 5 aircraft depot maintenance being performed at the closing san antonio air logistics center .
appendix i lists the depot maintenance reporting requirements contained in the act .
this review included examining documents , reviewing processes and procedures , and conducting discussions with cognizant air force and dod officials .
in assessing the c - 5 competition's compliance with applicable laws and regulations , we reviewed the solicitation , proposal evaluation , and award in the context of applicable laws and regulations .
we also assessed several specific concerns raised by the participants .
because the air force's depot competition procedures use the competitive acquisition system , the standards in chapter 137 of title 10 of the united states code ( governing dod acquisitions ) and the far apply to the extent they are consistent with the basic public - private competition statutes .
among other things , these standards require that the requirements in a solicitation be stated clearly and unambiguously and that restrictive provisions be included only to the extent necessary to satisfy an agency's needs .
to mitigate the impact of the closings on the local communities and employees , the administration announced its intention to maintain employment levels by privatizing the depots' workloads in place .
both the public and private competitors raised questions about the proposal's cost evaluation and adjustments .
congress included provisions in the fiscal year 1998 authorization act that require us to review and report on the process , procedures , and results of these competitions .
to determine whether adjustments made in the source selection evaluation were accurate and supported , we ( 1 ) discussed the selection process with cognizant air force and dod officials , as well as the offerors ; ( 2 ) reviewed the calculation methods for the various cost element estimates used in the cost evaluation ; ( 3 ) compared the cost elements among offerors to test for reasonableness ; ( 4 ) discussed the rational for cost element treatment in the evaluation with the evaluation team members ; and ( 5 ) discussed each offeror's assessment of cost element treatment in the evaluation and followed up on issues or concerns raised .
in response to congressional concerns regarding the appropriateness of its privatization - in - place plans , the air force revised its strategy to allow the public depots to participate in public - private competitions for the closing depot workloads .
