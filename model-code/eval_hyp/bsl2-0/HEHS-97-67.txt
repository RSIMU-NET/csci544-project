currently , dod has a major telemedicine effort underway to provide medical support for u.s. peacekeeping forces in bosnia .
dod has devised ways to use this new technology to deliver health care on the battlefield or during peacetime operations .
although many players throughout the federal government and the private sector are involved in telemedicine , the department of defense ( dod ) is considered a leader in research related to telemedicine efforts .
in march 1995 , the vice president directed the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) to lead efforts to develop federal policies that foster cost - effective health applications using communications technologies , including telemedicine .
as with other emerging technologies , telemedicine has not been precisely defined .
this technology is expected to affect health care providers , payers , and consumers in both the public and private sectors .
the influx of recent advanced communications technologies , coupled with changing incentives in the health care marketplace , has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the potential of telemedicine .
hhs was required to prepare a report on current telemedicine projects , the range of potential telemedicine applications , and public and private actions to promote telemedicine and remove existing barriers to its use .
the act further required telecommunications companies to provide discounts to health care providers in rural areas .
in 1993 , several members of congress established the senate and house ad hoc steering committee on telemedicine to advise legislators on integrating new technologies into health care reform strategies .
telemedicine is also expected to impact how medical care is delivered , who delivers it , and who pays for it .
in addition , other agencies are providing personnel support .
