since most of these costs had not been reported by dod , the chairman requested that we review and report on ( 1 ) the scope of ongoing operations at dod installations that have associated environmental cleanup costs , ( 2 ) the potential magnitude of cleanup costs associated with those operations , and ( 3 ) the availability of data to develop related cleanup cost estimates .
the previous chairman of your committee expressed concern about the long - term budgetary implications associated with environmental cleanup costs related to the ongoing operations of the department of defense ( dod ) .
ongoing operations refer to general property , plant , and equipment ( pp&e ) facilities or other assets that are currently being operated or are currently in use on dod installations .
neither dod's financial statements nor the defense environmental restoration program ( derp ) annual report to congress have provided the congress with cleanup cost information on all of dod's closed or inactive operations known to result in hazardous wastes .
based on dod records , these installations appeared to have a high potential for environmental cleanup costs related to facilities and assets used in operations .
dod is subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern restoration ( cleanup ) of contamination from past operations and control of hazardous waste related to active facilities ( ongoing operations ) .
because dod did not have a centralized or comprehensive system for identifying , summarizing , maintaining , and reporting the cleanup costs associated with all of its ongoing operations , we could not determine the full scope and magnitude of its related liability .
we have also issued a series of reports related to the environmental liability associated with the cleanup and disposal of dod's weapons systems .
examples of operating facilities and other assets with associated cleanup costs include hazardous and solid waste landfills and incinerators , hazardous waste storage facilities , open burn / open detonation sites , and underground storage tanks .
therefore , we expanded our work to cover these additional unreported liabilities as well .
dod must also follow federal accounting standards and its own financial management regulation ( fmr ) to ensure complete recognition and financial reporting of the associated liabilities .
the previous chairman also requested a similar review of dod's training ranges that have associated environmental cleanup and disposal costs , and we recently issued a separate report on that category of pp&e .
dod has taken incremental steps in recent years to report a more complete picture of its environmental liabilities , but substantial issues remain in certain areas , including accounting for and reporting estimated cleanup costs for all ongoing and inactive / closed operations .
therefore , as agreed with your staff , we selected 6 of the more than 1,500 active installations reported by dod — 2 from each military service — to review .
finally , we obtained cleanup cost estimates for those six installations .
while we originally focused on ongoing operations , the information at the six installations we visited indicated that dod also was not estimating and reporting liabilities associated with a significant portion of pp&e that was no longer being used in its operations .
