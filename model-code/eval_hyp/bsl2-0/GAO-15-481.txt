medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans .
as medicaid spending and enrollment grew in recent years , states increasingly turned to the managed care delivery model as a way to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries .
under ppaca , states were allowed to expand eligibility for medicaid under their state plan to most nonelderly , nonpregnant adults who are not eligible for medicare and whose income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level .
medicaid serves low - income and medically needy individuals .
medicaid , a federal - state health financing program for low - income and medically needy individuals , served approximately 65 million beneficiaries at a total cost of about $508 billion in fiscal year 2014 .
more than half of those beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans .
under this delivery model , states typically contract with managed care organizations ( mco ) to provide a specific set of medicaid - covered services to beneficiaries .
ppaca also provides for a 5 percent disregard when calculating income for determining medicaid eligibility for this population , which effectively increases this income level to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .
however , recent evidence suggests that the quality of medicaid encounter data may be improving and stronger requirements surrounding encounter data submissions suggest that such improvements could continue .
for purposes of this report , references to ppaca include the amendments made by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 , pub .
analyses of beneficiaries' service utilization could enhance program knowledge and serve as a baseline for future analyses of trends in utilization over time and of the factors that may contribute to differences across states .
variation in medicaid managed care payments: medicaid mco payments to providers for specific services vary substantially across states and this variation could affect the service utilization of beneficiaries .

the state pays the mcos a set amount per beneficiary per month to provide the specific services covered under each managed care plan .
you asked us to examine the level of services provided to beneficiaries in medicaid managed care .
states that enroll their most medically needy beneficiaries into managed care plans are likely to have higher service utilization .
these codes are used by providers to bill for professional services .
within the four broad categories of professional services , e / m services include preventive services , office and inpatient visits , consultations , and emergency room or critical care visits ; procedural services include allergy , cardiovascular , ophthalmology , surgery - administered drugs ( including chemotherapy ) , and immunizations / injections ; ancillary services include pathology and lab services , physical medicine , radiology , and anesthesia services ; and other professional services include oxygen therapy , hospital - mandated on - call service , and other services that are not otherwise classified in the categories above .
in this report , we describe what encounter data indicate about the service utilization of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans .
