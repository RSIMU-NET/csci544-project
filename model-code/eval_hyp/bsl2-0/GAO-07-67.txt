in february 2006 , the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) appropriated $2 billion to fund , among other purposes , these two categories of services under approved demonstration projects .
during the first 3 weeks after the hurricane , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , which oversees the medicaid program , announced that states could apply for demonstration projects — to be approved by cms — through which the federal government would fund its share of expenditures for health care services for certain individuals affected by the hurricane .
the devastation caused by hurricane katrina compounded the health care needs of these communities , increasing the numbers of eligible beneficiaries for medicaid and adding large numbers of uninsured individuals .
additionally , individuals displaced from their homes and jobs evacuated their home states and moved to other states , such as texas , which strained these states' health care resources .
with respect to the third category , funds were available for the nonfederal ( state ) share of expenditures for services provided to existing medicaid and schip beneficiaries from certain areas of the directly affected states .
the first category allowed individuals affected by the hurricane and eligible under an approved demonstration project to receive benefits under medicaid or the state children's health insurance program ( schip ) for up to 5 months .
funds were also available for the fourth category of restoring access to health care in impacted communities .
dra did not specify how the $2 billion in hurricane katrina relief funding would be allocated among the states ; rather , cms was responsible for determining these allocations .
category i — time - limited medicaid and schip services: this category was for the nonfederal ( state ) share of expenditures associated with medicaid and schip services ( including administrative costs ) provided to individuals affected by hurricane katrina and eligible under an approved demonstration project .
dra further specified that the $2 billion could be used for two additional categories of expenditures that were not time - limited .
this report presents results of our work examining: ( 1 ) how cms allocated the dra funds to states , ( 2 ) the extent to which states have used dra funds , and ( 3 ) whether alabama , louisiana , mississippi , and texas anticipate the need for additional funds after dra funds are expended .
the second category , known as uncompensated care , allowed states to reimburse providers rendering services from august 24 , 2005 , through january 31 , 2006 , to individuals affected by the hurricane who had no other method of payment or insurance .
compared to the rest of the united states , higher proportions of the nonelderly populations in these directly affected states were enrolled in medicaid , a program jointly financed by the federal government and states to provide health care coverage to certain categories of low - income individuals .
cms identified two categories of services covered under these demonstration projects , both of which were subject to time limitations .
category iii — existing medicaid and schip beneficiaries: this category was designated to compensate states for the nonfederal ( state ) share of expenditures associated with services provided to existing medicaid and schip beneficiaries from certain areas of directly affected states .
