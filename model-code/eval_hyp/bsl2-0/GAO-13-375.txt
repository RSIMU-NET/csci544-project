we examined ( 1 ) how the capabilities of ipaws have changed since 2009 and what barriers , if any , are affecting its implementation and ( 2 ) the results of the nationwide eas test and federal efforts under way to address identified weaknesses .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within dhs is responsible for modernizing eas and implementing the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) , which is intended to integrate eas and other public - alerting systems into a larger network to form a comprehensive public - alerting system .
building on our previous work , you asked us to provide information on recent efforts to implement ipaws and improve eas .
in september 2009 , we reported that eas exhibited long - standing weaknesses that limit its effectiveness and that fema had made little progress in implementing ipaws.2011 , fema , in conjunction with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , conducted the first - ever nationwide test of eas , which revealed that some portions of the system did not work as intended .
to meet these objectives , we examined federal agency data and reports since 2009 , including fema's inventory and evaluation of public - alerting systems ; the ipaws program management plan ; nationwide eas test data and preliminary reports ; and various agency orders and rules .
although eas was originally designed to alert the public via radios and televisions , in june 2006 , an executive order directed the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to modernize the nation's public - alerting systems to ensure the capability of distributing alerts though a variety of telecommunications devices beyond broadcast media .
the emergency alert system ( eas ) is a national public warning system that requires broadcasters , cable operators , and other communications service providers to provide the president with communications capability to address the american people during a national emergency .
we met with officials from fcc , fema , dhs , and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) to understand the agencies' progress in implementing ipaws and efforts to address weaknesses identified from the nationwide eas test .
a reliable and comprehensive system to alert americans during emergencies can help save lives and reduce damages and hardship .
effective public emergency alerts via various telecommunications modes are critical in major events such as natural disaster , terrorist attack , or war .
we selected these states and the district of columbia because , among other things , they have additional public - alerting systems other than eas , and some have the ability to provide alerts for individuals with disabilities and limited english .
for both objectives , we also met with representatives from industry trade groups , including radio and television broadcasters , cable operators , and wireless service providers , and an organization representing individuals with disabilities .
to determine the reliability of the data used in this report , we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed agency officials about their processes for reviewing the data and ensuring their accuracy .
the selected states also experienced problems during the nationwide eas test .
we found the agency data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review .
