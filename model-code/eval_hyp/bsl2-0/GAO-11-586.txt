goals include replacing aging computer hardware and revamping complex and duplicative farm program benefits processing by 2014 .
since 2004 , fsa has been planning a program called modernize and innovate the delivery of agricultural systems ( midas ) to modernize the information technology ( it ) systems that process these benefits .
the united states department of agriculture's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) is responsible for administering billions of dollars annually in program benefits to farmers and ranchers .
specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the scope and status of midas , ( 2 ) whether midas has appropriate program management , and ( 3 ) whether midas has appropriate executive oversight and governance .
the estimated life cycle costs for the program are expected to approach half a billion dollars .
to describe the program's scope and status , we reviewed program documents and interviewed agency officials to identify the farm programs , interfaces , and systems ; the milestones and products planned and delivered ; and the costs budgeted and expended .
this report responds to your request that we review the progress of fsa's modernization program .
to assess whether there is appropriate program management , we compared program plans and artifacts with leading practices for program planning and monitoring , requirements management , contract management , and risk management to determine the extent to which practices were planned and executed .
to assess whether there is appropriate executive oversight and governance , we compared usda and fsa policies , plans , and artifacts for midas oversight and governance with our guidance and that of the office of management and budget ( omb ) to determine whether this guidance has been applied .
we conducted this performance audit from october 2010 to july 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
in view of congressional concern about the complexity , scale , and challenges of fsa's it modernization , usda has been required to report to the committees on agriculture and appropriations of the senate and house of representatives on key aspects of midas management , including cost , schedule and milestones , oversight and investment management , and integration with other modernization initiatives .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the scope and status of the modernize and innovate the delivery of agricultural systems ( midas ) program ; ( 2 ) whether midas has appropriate program management ; and ( 3 ) whether midas has appropriate executive oversight and governance .
improve data management: make data more readily available to fsa personnel and farmers and ranchers — including self - service capabilities — and increase data accuracy and security .
moreover , the agency had not adequately assessed its schedule estimate because business requirements had not been considered when fsa reduced the implementation time frame from 10 years to 2 years .
see appendix i for a complete description of our objectives , scope , and methodology .
in response , usda has submitted a series of reports to congress that reflect the department's approach toward the modernization program and its progress .
