this report provides information on ( 1 ) fema public assistance program spending and actions fema and puerto rico have taken to provide oversight of federal recovery funds , ( 2 ) initial challenges identified by officials from fema and puerto rico with the recovery process , and ( 3 ) puerto rico's economic and disaster recovery plan .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , leads the federal effort to mitigate , respond to , and recover from disasters , both natural and manmade .
fema also plans to work with puerto rico to ensure that it has effective internal controls in place to oversee federal recovery funds .
in addition , fema coordinated with puerto rico to submit an economic and disaster recovery plan to congress , as required by the bipartisan budget act of 2018 .
these activities include , among other efforts , debris removal ; life - saving emergency protective measures ; and the repair , replacement , or restoration of disaster - damaged publicly - owned facilities .
among other responsibilities , fema administers the public assistance program in partnership with the government of puerto rico ( puerto rico ) , providing grant funding for a wide range of response and recovery activities .
as part of that effort , we have several reviews ongoing of fema's and puerto rico's disaster recovery planning , oversight , and execution efforts in puerto rico .
this includes $30 billion to comprehensively modernize puerto rico's energy sector and improve its resiliency , nearly $5 billion to replace puerto rico's drinking water system , and between $8 to $12 billion to rehabilitate owner - occupied homes that were substantially damaged by the hurricanes , among other things .
you asked us to review the federal government's response and recovery efforts related to the 2017 hurricanes .
in its recovery plan , puerto rico estimates that $132 billion in funding from 2018 through 2028 will be needed to repair and reconstruct the infrastructure damaged by the hurricanes .
in addition , we are conducting a broader body of work covering various disaster response and recovery issues , including disaster recovery in the u.s. virgin islands and impacted states , and will also be reporting on those issues over the next year .
for this report , we reviewed relevant fema public assistance program documentation , and we obtained and analyzed data from fema's emergency management mission integrated environment ( emmie ) and integrated financial management information system ( ifmis ) databases .
we have another ongoing review that will examine disaster recovery efforts in puerto rico and we plan to issue that report in 2019 .
these databases include data on public assistance program obligations and expenditures related to hurricanes irma and maria in puerto rico as of the end of fiscal year 2018 .
although the storm moved offshore in the early afternoon of september 20 , 2017 , tropical storm - force winds continued into the late night hours , causing extensive damage to electrical utilities , roads , bridges , and other public infrastructure throughout puerto rico .
according to the national hurricane center , hurricane maria was the most intense hurricane to make landfall in puerto rico since 1928 .
