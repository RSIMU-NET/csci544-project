other challenges can make drug development for tropical diseases , rare pediatric diseases , and medical countermeasures more difficult than for other drugs .
to encourage the development of drugs to treat tropical diseases , treat rare pediatric diseases , and use as medical countermeasures , congress established three priority review voucher ( prv ) programs under which the food and drug administration ( fda ) awards a prv to a drug sponsor upon approval of that sponsor's drug in one of these three areas .
specifically , tropical diseases often affect people living in low - income areas outside of the united states , making it difficult for drug sponsors to recover drug development costs ; rare pediatric diseases affect a limited number of children , making it difficult to identify and recruit sufficient numbers of patients to include in studies ; and medical countermeasures treat high - priority threats that affect health security , making it difficult to test the drugs because exposing study volunteers to such threats would be an unethical and unacceptable risk .
we reviewed these articles for information related to the prv programs , including the extent to which prvs are incentives for drug development and alternative incentives to the prv programs for developing drugs for tropical diseases , rare pediatric diseases , and medical countermeasures .
publicly available information included prv sales ( including sales prices ) , transfers , purchases , and redemptions reported by drug sponsors in documents such as press releases and securities and exchange commission filings .
drug sponsors — facing a lengthy and expensive drug development process — may be reluctant to develop treatments for these diseases or conditions given the small markets or potentially limited profitability for them .
for all three objectives , we interviewed fda officials ; representatives from seven stakeholder groups , including trade associations , patient advocates , and organizations that partner with or provide funding to drug sponsors and are familiar with the prv programs ( hereafter , stakeholders ) ; seven academic researchers with expertise in drug development , drug pricing , or the prv programs ( hereafter , researchers ) ; and representatives from seven drug sponsors that have been awarded , purchased , or redeemed a prv .
the 21st century cures act included a provision for us to review and report on the prv programs .
few drugs are available for certain tropical diseases , rare pediatric diseases , and material threat medical countermeasures ( medical countermeasures ) , despite their potential to affect millions of people .
this report examines 1. the number of prvs that have been awarded , and what is known about them and about the drugs for which they were awarded ; 2. the number of prvs that have been redeemed , and what is known about them and about the drugs for which they were redeemed ; and 3. what is known about the extent to which prv programs provide incentives for drug development to meet unmet needs .
the potential for additional revenue that comes from marketing a drug approximately 4 months sooner — or the proceeds that may come from selling the prv to another drug sponsor — could provide an incentive for drug sponsors to develop drugs for tropical diseases , rare pediatric diseases , or medical countermeasures .
