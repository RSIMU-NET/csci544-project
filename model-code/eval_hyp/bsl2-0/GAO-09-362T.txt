with an annual appropriation of about $512 billion in fiscal year 2009 and supplemental funding of about $807 billion over the past several years to support the global war on terrorism , dod has a larger budget than any other federal agency .
the department was expected to invest more than $357 billion over the next 5 years on the development and procurement of major defense acquisition programs .
at installations within the united states , contractors provide base operations support ( e.g. , food and housing ) and other administrative and logistical support .
in fiscal year 2008 , dod spent about $200 billion on contractor services , an amount that has more than doubled in real terms over the past decade .
while the combat effectiveness of u.s. forces and weapon systems is unparalleled , dod has not been as effective in managing its ongoing business operations , which have adversely affected mission performance and increased the department's vulnerability to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement .
dod's major weapon systems continue to take longer to develop , cost more , and deliver fewer quantities and capabilities than originally planned .
as the secretary of defense testified last month , however , “the spigot of defense funding opened by 9 / 11 is closing.” the secretary noted that with two major ongoing campaigns , the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on dod , including hard choices regarding defense acquisitions .
further , investment in weapons acquisition programs is now at its highest level in two decades .
the department's senior leadership has shown a commitment to transforming business operations , including its weapon systems acquisition and contract management processes , but challenges remain in sustaining and building on this momentum .
in both the united states and at deployed locations , dod relies heavily on contractors to help meet critical missions .
given the size of this investment , poor outcomes in dod's weapon system programs reverberate across the entire federal government .
current operational demands have highlighted the impact of these persistent problems as dod has been forced to work outside of its traditional acquisition process to acquire equipment that meets warfighter needs , as was the case with the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle .
every dollar wasted during the development and acquisition of weapon systems is money not available for other priorities within dod and across the government .
risk is inherent when relying on contractors to support dod missions .
however , many of these actions , such as the army's efforts to increase its acquisition workforce , will not be fully implemented for several years and progress will need to be closely monitored to ensure the steps undertaken result in their intended outcomes .
gao has issued numerous reports over the last decade discussing dod's long - standing challenges managing and overseeing service contractors .
dod estimated that over 200,000 contractor personnel were supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan in july 2008 , exceeding the number of uniformed military personnel in both countries .
today , i will discuss the challenges that affect dod's acquisition of major weapon systems , dod's management and oversight of service contracts , and steps dod has taken in response to our recommendations for these issues .
