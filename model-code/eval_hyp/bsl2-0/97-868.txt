these concerns prompted actions both in the united states and internationally .
the internet originated with research funding provided by the department of defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) to establish a military network .
an international ad hoc committee ( iahc ) , a coalition of individuals representing various constituencies , released a proposal for the administration and management of gtlds on february 4 , 1997 .
as its use expanded , a civilian segment evolved with support from the national science foundation ( nsf ) and other science agencies .
to assess whether the iahc proposal should be supported by the u.s. government , the executive branch created an interagency group to address the domain name issue and assigned lead responsibility to the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) of the department of commerce ( doc ) .
top level domains ( tlds ) appear at the end of an address and are either a given country code , such as .jp or .uk , or are generic designations ( gtlds ) , such as .com , .org , .net , .edu , or .gov .
the jpa extended through september 30 , 2009 , and focused on institutionalizing transparency and accountability mechanisms within icann .
there also was concern that the role played by iana lacked a legal foundation and required more permanence to ensure the stability of the internet and the domain name system .
those computers , called root servers , must be coordinated to ensure connectivity across the internet .
the proposal recommended that seven new gtlds be created and that additional registrars be selected to compete with each other in the granting of registration services for all new second level domain names .
the aoc affirms commitments made by doc and icann to ensure accountability and transparency ; preserve the security , stability , and resiliency of the dns ; promote competition , consumer trust , and consumer choice ; and promote international participation .
while there were ( and are ) no formal statutory authorities or international agreements governing the management and operation of the internet and the dns , several entities played key roles in the dns .
on september 29 , 2006 , doc announced a new joint project agreement ( jpa ) with icann which was intended to continue the transition to the private sector of the coordination of technical functions relating to management of the dns .
in addition , there was an increase in trademark disputes arising out of the enormous growth of registrations in the .com domain .
on september 30 , 2009 , doc and icann announced agreement on an affirmation of commitments ( aoc ) to "institutionalize and memorialize" the technical coordination of the dns globally and by a private - sector - led organization .
the domain name system ( dns ) is the distributed set of databases residing in computers around the world that contain the address numbers , mapped to corresponding domain names .
computers connected to the internet are identified by a unique internet protocol ( ip ) number that designates their specific location , thereby making it possible to send and receive messages and to access information from computers anywhere on the internet .
specifically , ntia stated that the u.s. government intends to preserve the security and stability of the dns , that the united states would continue to authorize changes or modifications to the root zone , that governments have legitimate interests in the management of their country code top level domains , that icann is the appropriate technical manager of the dns , and that dialogue related to internet governance should continue in relevant multiple fora .
