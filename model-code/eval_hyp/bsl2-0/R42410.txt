some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal funding in light of the current federal fiscal condition , deficit , and debt .
low or negative growth in the overall r&d investment may require movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities .
as congress acted to complete the fy2013 appropriations process it faced two overarching issues: the extent to which the federal r&d investment could grow in the context of increased pressure on discretionary spending and how available funding would be prioritized and allocated .
this report provides government - wide , multi - agency , and individual agency analyses of the president's fy2013 request as it relates to r&d and related activities and congressional actions on appropriations legislation , and specific information on appropriations enacted by congress in the fy2013 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , ( p.l .
for several agencies , research and development ( r&d ) funding is included in accounts with non - r&d activities .
its purposes include addressing specific concerns ( e.g. , national defense , health , safety , the environment , energy security ) , advancing knowledge generally , developing the scientific and engineering workforce , and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .
agency fy2013 appropriations were subject to one or more rescissions as well as sequestration .
113-6 ) for agencies that have made such information available .
congress plays a central role in defining the nation's r&d priorities as it makes decisions with respect to the size and distribution of aggregate , agency , and programmatic r&d funding .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease .
however , widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions involving prioritization of r&d within the context of the entire federal budget and among competing priorities within the federal r&d portfolio .
most of the r&d funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of the funding agencies .
when final appropriations are not resolved until after the president's next fiscal year budget request is prepared ( as was the case for fy2013 appropriations and the president's fy2014 request ) funding for agency r&d may not be known until the subsequent year's budget request .
in such cases , the funding level may not be known until it is included in the president's fy2015 budget request and / or agency budget justifications .
the u.s. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering research and development .
for such agencies , unless congress provides funding at the full request level as requested , it is not possible to know the agency's r&d funding level .
however , some agencies may opt to provide funding estimates , publicly or privately ( for example , in response to a crs inquiry ) .
determination of funding levels can be complicated by a number of factors , including rescissions , sequestration , supplemental funding , transfers , and reprogramming .
