as challenges to state and federal laws move through the courts , many questions remain .
proponents of strong post - incarceration controls argue that the restrictions are necessary to reduce a demonstrably high recidivism rate , safeguard potential victims , and assist law enforcement in tracking offenders .
opponents question the restrictions' efficacy and argue that they are disproportionate to the crimes committed .
these and other policy issues may be informed by judicial determinations .
residency restrictions are a matter of state law but also implicate federal constitutional guarantees .
three such controls — residency restrictions , registration requirements , and civil commitment — are especially at issue in judicial decisions in recent years .
as a result , laws have been enacted which impose a variety of post - incarceration controls on sex offenders .
in two cases decided in the spring of 2010 , united states v. comstock and united states v. carr , the u.s. supreme court addressed questions raised by federal civil commitment and registration requirements .
should an offender be subjected to restrictions for crimes which occurred decades ago ? .
should juveniles be subjected to the same restrictions as adults ? .
this report examines background and case law related to registration requirements and residency restrictions .
§ 4248 , is within congress's authority .
the united states witnessed an increase in sex offender management policy at the federal , state , and local levels beginning in the 1990s .
the related issue of civil commitment was at issue in comstock .

in that case , the supreme court held that a federal statute authorizing the civil commitment of "sexually dangerous persons," 18 u.s.c .
although defendants invoke different constitutional provisions to challenge restrictions , some overarching themes may be drawn regarding post - incarceration controls .
as restrictions have increased in both number and severity , questions arise .
fundamental to the outcome of their characterization are twin propositions: criminal laws , even those labeled as civil remedies , must afford constitutional protections to criminal defendants ; while civil non - punitive regulations do not require the same adherence to substantive and procedural safeguards .
one theme involves timing: as new and existing controls continue to apply retroactively to individuals whose conviction for a sex offense predated the control , legal questions will persist regarding the constitutional limits .
more broadly , a continuing dilemma in ex post facto and other challenges arises because post - conviction controls generally comprise both civil and criminal elements .
registration may have dual goals of assisting law enforcement and preventing future crimes .
while federal laws govern mandatory registration and community notification , many states and localities have gone further by enacting residency restrictions .
instead , opponents argue that these restrictions can cause a myriad of unintended consequences , such as ( 1 ) isolating offenders , potentially forcing them to live in rural areas that may lack sufficient employment opportunities , transportation , housing , and treatment ; ( 2 ) creating homelessness , making it difficult for law enforcement to track offenders ; ( 3 ) causing offenders to go underground and not update registration information ; and ( 4 ) preventing offenders from residing with supportive family members who live in restricted areas .
