to perform our analysis , we reviewed relevant reports produced by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , general services administration ( gsa ) , and national archives and records administration ( nara ) .
in this statement i will describe the current uses of web 2.0 technologies by federal agencies , key challenges associated with their use of these technologies , and initial steps agencies have taken to address identified issues .
the use of these tools by federal agencies is growing tremendously , supported by initiatives from the administration , directives from government leaders , and demands from the public .
however , agency use of these technologies also may present risks associated with properly managing and protecting government records and sensitive information , including personally identifiable information .
my testimony is based on our analysis of federal government policies , reports , and guidance related to the use of web 2.0 technologies .
these tools offer the potential to better include people in the governing process and may also contribute to accomplishing agency missions .
federal agencies are increasingly using recently developed technologies ( commonly referred to as "web 2.0" technologies ) that offer flexible , sophisticated capabilities for interaction with individuals , allowing agencies and the public to publish comments , photos , and videos directly on agency - sponsored web pages .
based on our review of these reports , we identified potential challenges related to privacy , security , records management , and freedom of information .
thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the use of “web 2.0” technologies by federal government agencies and the challenges associated with the use of these technologies .
we interviewed agency officials involved in the development of these reports to validate the challenges identified in relevant reports and obtain their views regarding the extent to which government efforts are underway to address them .
agencies have taken steps to identify these issues and begun developing processes and procedures for addressing them .
federal agencies have been adapting web 2.0 technologies to support their individual missions .
until such procedures are in place , agencies will likely continue to face challenges in appropriately using web 2.0 technologies .
we conducted our work from february 2010 to july 2010 in accordance with all sections of gao's quality assurance framework that are relevant to our objectives .
the framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations to our work .
in addition , at your request , we are currently undertaking a more comprehensive review of the management and protection of information collected and maintained by commercial providers of social media on behalf of or in association with federal agencies .
as federal agencies have increasingly adopted web 2.0 technologies , often by making use of commercially provided services , information technology officials have begun to consider the array of privacy , security , records management , and freedom of information issues that such usage poses .
once these issues are understood , measures can then be developed and implemented to address them .
for example: ● the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) uses facebook to inform the public about the developmental and humanitarian assistance that it is providing to different countries in the world .
