one key challenge dhs has faced is effectively and strategically managing its sizable workforce of nearly 167,000 employees in order to respond to current and emerging 21st century challenges .
since its inception in march 2003 , dhs has faced enormous challenges related to protecting the nation from terrorism while organizing its predecessor agencies — several with existing program and management challenges — into a coherent and integrated department .
strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious change management strategy .
because these challenges could have serious consequences for the security of our country , we designated the department's implementation and transformation a high - risk area in 2003 and reiterated our concerns in january 2005 and again in january 2007 .
developing a workforce that reflects all segments of society and our nation's diversity is a significant part of an agency's transformation of its organization to meet the challenges of the 21st century .
today , as requested , my remarks will focus on demographic data related to career positions in the federal government as a whole and dhs's workforce as well as actions the department has reported taking to create and manage a diverse workforce .
also , given the changing demographics of our society , diversity management is a key aspect of strategic human capital management .
for our analyses of governmentwide career and dhs career demographic data , we extracted data from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) central personnel data file ( cpdf ) and analyzed these data to identify the extent of changes in the representation of women and minorities in dhs's workforce between september 2003 and september 2007 .
i am pleased to be here today to provide the committee with information on diversity of the federal workforce and at the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , which was created from a disparate group of 22 agencies with multiple missions , values , and cultures into a cabinet department whose goals are to , among other things , protect u.s. borders and infrastructure , improve intelligence and information sharing , and prevent and respond to potential terrorist attacks .
dhs reported taking steps to affect the diversity of its workforce that include establishing an objective in its strategic plan concerning the recruitment and development , among other things , of a diverse workforce ; partnering with minority - serving institutions and professional service organizations ; and implementing an ses candidate development program .
these steps are consistent with several leading diversity management practices .
however , we did not analyze the factors that contributed to changes identified in dhs's workforce over this 4-year period .
for the dhs developmental pool of potential ses successors ( generally gs - 15s and gs - 14s ) , the total number increased by more than 50 percent — going from 6,525 to 10,107 .
white men decreased by 4.2 percentage points , and minorities increased by 4.6 percentage points .
when reviewing representation by pay plan / grades , among the higher grades — general schedule ( gs ) gs - 13 to gs - 15 , senior executive service ( ses ) , and senior level / senior technical ( sl / st ) — minority employees generally represented less than 10 percent of these career employees in 2003 and 2007 .
