ppaca stipulates that the age and gender adjustment would be made based on the premium cost of the blue cross and blue shield ( bcbs ) standard plan under the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) .
based on the premise that older individuals tend to have higher health care costs than younger individuals and that younger females tend to have higher health care costs than younger males due to the potential for maternity costs , the age and gender adjustment is designed to lower the tax burden , compared to what it would have been without the adjustment , for employers that have costlier employees so that taxes are owed based on the plan design and not based on member costs .
to assess the benefits and limitations of using the bcbs standard plan data , as well as to identify alternatives , we reviewed relevant statutory provisions and the internal revenue service's ( irs ) 2015 notices related to the age and gender adjustment , as well as other agency documentation and federal internal control standards .
some industry experts have raised questions about the use of the bcbs standard plan premium cost data as the basis of this calculation , including bcbs association ( bcbsa ) representatives who contend that the age and gender makeup , as well as the costs of the bcbs standard plan members , differ from those of the national workforce .
however , this limit could be adjusted upward if an employer's workforce — based on its age and gender characteristics — was likely to have higher health costs than the national workforce , on average .
the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , enacted in 2010 , included a provision for a 40 percent excise tax on high - cost employer - sponsored health coverage ( hereafter referred to as the tax ) intended , in part , to raise funds to offset costs associated with the law .
the tax would be imposed when the annual cost of coverage for an employee exceeds an established applicable dollar limit , set originally at $10,200 for self - only coverage and $27,500 for coverage other than self - only .
this report examines 1. the benefits and limitations of using fehbp bcbs standard plan data as the basis of the age and gender adjustment and alternatives to these data that could be considered ; and 2. how any limitations of the bcbs standard plan data could be mitigated .
the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 includes a provision for us to study the suitability of using the bcbs standard plan premium cost data as the basis of the calculation for the age and gender adjustment .
this is known as the age and gender adjustment .
in addition , we interviewed knowledgeable officials from irs , the office of personnel management ( opm ) , the department of the treasury , and two agencies within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — the agency for healthcare research and quality and the centers for medicare & medicaid services .
to assess how limitations of the bcbs standard plan data might be mitigated , we analyzed 2010 and 2015 fehbp cost and enrollment data provided by opm , as well as current population survey ( cps ) data available through the u.s. census bureau and the bureau of labor statistics .
