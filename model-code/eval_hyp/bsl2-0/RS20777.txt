in 2006 , filings dropped sharply , suggesting that the new law caused many to accelerate their filings , and that many petitions that would have been filed in 2006 ( or later ) were pushed forward by bankruptcy reform .
109-8 ) took effect in october 2005 .
whether bapcpa will reduce filings in the long run is still unclear .
in that year , the number of filings surpassed 2 million â€” there was a "rush to the courthouse" before the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 ( bapcpa ; p.l .
filings rose steadily from the 2006 lows until 2010 , when they exceeded 1.5 million , which was approximately the level during the four years before bapcpa .
 figure 1 and table 1 show bankruptcy filings since 1980. business filings peaked in 1987 , but the number of consumer filings continued to grow through 2005 .
over the first three quarters of 2011 , there was a slight decline from the year - earlier numbers .
some lenders have tightened their credit standards for new loans .
in dollar terms , however , mortgage debt ( other than home equity loans ) accounted for most of the drop .
some households may be paying down their debt , others may be borrowing less , and the amount of debt written off by lenders as uncollectible has increased .
several factors appear to have contributed to the fall in debt balances .
in december 2007 , the u.s. economy went into recession , in the midst of global financial panic .
the decline in debt balances continued for 11 calendar quarters , until debt outstanding rose slightly in the second quarter of 2011 .
over the past decade , this measure rose steadily ( but not dramatically ) , until the recession and financial crisis that began in 2007 .
mortgage balances have fallen because of mortgage modifications or other negotiations that reduce principal outstanding , and because foreclosed homes are often sold for less than the amount of the old mortgage .
since 1980 , however , declining interest rates have permitted households to take on more debt without a comparable increase in the interest payments required to service that debt .
on a percentage basis , home equity and credit card debt led the decline , as shown in table 4 .
the increases in this figure , which between 1990 and 2007 rose more than twice as fast as the debt burden , suggest that further increases in bankruptcy filings ( and perhaps problems for lenders ) may lie ahead if interest rates should rise suddenly or unexpectedly .
in the third quarter , debt levels fell again .
consumer credit consists of ( 1 ) revolving credit , or credit card debt , and ( 2 ) non - revolving debt , which is dominated by auto and college loans ( though it also includes loans for boats , mobile homes , vacations , and so on ) .
household debt levels began to fall in three of the four categories shown in table 2 .
the aggregate household debt numbers mask important differences among families: some have done very well in the long booms of the 1980s and 1990s , while others have taken on debt that they have difficulty repaying .
