this report ( 1 ) addresses the extent to which dod has identified and assessed security risks related to iot devices , ( 2 ) assesses the extent to which dod has developed policies and guidance related to iot devices , and ( 3 ) describes other actions that dod has taken to address security risks related to iot devices .
house report 114-537 , accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2017 , and house report 114-573 , accompanying a bill for the intelligence authorization act of fiscal year 2017 , included provisions that we assess the security challenges dod faces that are associated with the iot .
although several dod components have security responsibilities relating to iot , no single lead office or organization in dod is responsible for iot security , according to dod officials .
according to the director of national intelligence , iot devices are designed and fielded with minimal security requirements and testing , and an ever - increasing complexity of networks could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in civilian infrastructures and u.s. government systems .
this report does not identify specific details of dod assessments and other actions dod is taking to address security risks related to iot devices — information that dod deemed to be sensitive .
although dod has been using automated sensors and controls for more than a century and has been connecting them to computers for decades , the department is now in the midst of enormous technological change .
the scope of this review includes a range of iot devices , to include wearable fitness devices , portable electronic devices , smartphones , and infrastructure devices , but it excludes weapon systems — such as airplanes and tanks — and intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance networks , which could be described as an example of the iot .
even as the iot creates many benefits , it is important to acknowledge the many security implications that may arise .
with such capabilities — including personal smart devices acquired and used by department of defense ( dod ) employees ( e.g. , wearable fitness devices ) , smart devices that dod acquires ( e.g. , smartphones ) , and smart devices that dod vendors may acquire and install on dod installations ( e.g. , devices within industrial and utility control systems ) — being given internet access and thus becoming part of the iot , dod has stated that it is entering a rapidly deepening pool of vulnerability .
for example , in october 2016 , one security incident involving iot devices received national attention .
while there have always been risks to dod sensors and controls , their proprietary nature and isolation previously limited the possibility of attack , according to a dod document about the iot .
to address the extent to which dod has identified and assessed security risks related to iot devices , we obtained documentary and testimonial evidence from dod reports and officials identifying risks and threats related to iot devices , including infrastructure devices and smartphones .
dod has made some progress in addressing the security challenges we identify in this report , including: ( 1 ) identifying a number of iot security risks and notional threat scenarios ; ( 2 ) examining security risks of iot devices by conducting assessments on critical infrastructure ; ( 3 ) developing policies and guidance for iot devices ; and ( 4 ) establishing ongoing efforts , such as research programs , to mitigate the security risks with these devices .
