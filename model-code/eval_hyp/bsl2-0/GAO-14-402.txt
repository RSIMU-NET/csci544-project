over the next several years , rental assistance contracts will expire for about 38,000 affordable housing units currently assisted through the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) rent supplement ( rent supp ) , rental assistance payment ( rap ) , and moderate rehabilitation ( mod rehab ) programs .
this report examines ( 1 ) how hud has implemented rad conversions of tenant - protection vouchers to project - based vouchers for properties under the covered programs ; ( 2 ) how these conversions are expected to affect the long - term percentage of project - based vouchers and costs to the voucher program ; and ( 3 ) how these conversions have affected selected converted units and the housing choices available to assisted residents .
although these programs are no longer used to develop new units , many properties subsidized under these programs continue to offer rental assistance to eligible low - income residents today .
to address these objectives , we reviewed and assessed hud guidance and procedures for implementing the rad program .
hud's rental assistance demonstration ( rad ) program was created , in part , to respond to this concern .
however , upon contract expiration , owners of these properties will have few options for renewing the assistance and will no longer be required to maintain affordable rents or make their units available to low - income residents .
these conversions are also intended to allow property owners to leverage private debt and equity in order to address immediate capital needs .
hud used the rental assistance provided by these programs — referred to as covered programs in our report — with other subsidies to develop affordable housing from the 1960s through the 1980s .
the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2012 mandated that we review the long - term impact of conversions under rad on the ratio of project - based vouchers to tenant - based vouchers .
we compared hud's guidance and procedures to the applicable federal internal control standards .
specifically , to describe how hud has implemented conversions of the covered programs under rad , we reviewed hud's rad notices and guidance on processes and procedures the agency uses to process applications submitted for conversions .
prior to the creation of rad in 2011 , hud had limited authority to extend the availability of rental assistance at these properties when the contracts expired ( or owners terminated them ) .
as preservation of affordable housing is one of hud's goals for its housing policies , project - based vouchers tie the assistance to the property — and preserve the property's long - term affordability — because residents with project - based vouchers can only benefit from the subsidy if they remain in the specific unit .
the conversions result in a contract between the property owners and a public housing agency ( pha ) , which administers the program .
as a result , the number of permanent housing units that target low - income residents and offer subsidized rents declines .
however , hud would make tenant - protection vouchers available to the residents living in these units to keep their rents affordable and prevent them from being displaced .
