the largest wheat - producing countries are china , india , the united states , russia , canada , and australia .
u.s. wheat production accounts for about 9% - 10% of world production ; but the united states is the world's leading wheat exporter with roughly a 25% share of annual world trade .
however , the international wheat market is very competitive and foreign sales often hinge on wheat variety and product characteristics as well as price .
the united states produces all six of the world's major wheat classesâhard red winter ( hrw ) , hard red spring ( hrs ) , soft red winter ( srw ) , hard white , soft white , and durum .
white wheat and hrs wheat rely more than other wheat classes on sales into export markets .
price premiums and / or discounts reflecting quality differences often develop and can also influence buyer preferences .
however , linkages to national and global markets bring additional factorsâsuch as transportation costs , competitors' supplies , and foreign demandâinto play in determining the price of a particular wheat type and quality .
wheat is grown in almost every temperate - zone country of north america , europe , asia , and south america .
u.s. wheat is produced as both a winter and a spring crop .
wheat is the principal food grain grown in the united states ; however , a substantial portion ( 8% - 10% ) of the annual u.s. wheat crop is used as a feed grain .
almost half of the u.s. wheat crop is exported annually , although the importance of exports varies by class of wheat .
traditional , higher - protein wheats command a premium over lower - protein varieties , often referred to as the "protein premium" ( figure 1 ) .
the larger the share of exports to production , the greater the vulnerability to international market forces .
in local markets , the demand for a particular wheat class ( and quality ) relative to its nearby supply will determine local prices .
hard wheats generally contain higher protein levelsâa desirable trait for bread making , while softer wheats may be preferable for making noodles , crackers , and pastries .
in the u.s. domestic market , flour millers are the major users of wheat , milling about 24% of annual wheat production into flour since 2000 .
as a result , wheat must compete with other cereals for a place at the consumer's dinner table , while also vying with coarse grains and other feedstuffs in livestock feed markets .
other major wheat processors include breakfast food , pet food , and feed manufacturers .
wheat may be used directly in feed rations when alternate feedstuffs are lacking or when production - related quality damage makes the wheat unmarketable as a food .
in most cases , a wheat buyer at a flour mill will "source" wheat by general location and primary quality attributes such as protein quantity and quality ( i.e. , gluten share ) and baking performance .
wheat milling by - products such as bran , shorts , and middlings are also used by feed manufacturers in the production of animal feeds .
