for example , the oecd estimates that in 2009 the eu accounted for nearly half ( 48% or $120.8 billion ) of all government support for agriculture ( both monetary and non - monetary ) among the major developed economies , compared with a 12% share ( $30.6 billion ) for u.s. agricultural support outlays ( for a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 ) .
the eu ranked as the fifth most important destination for u.s. agricultural products behind canada ( 17% share ) , mexico ( 13% ) , china ( 12% ) , and japan ( 11% ) during that same period .
however , as a source for u.s. agricultural - product imports , the eu ranked first , with a 22% share placing it ahead of canada ( 20% ) , mexico ( 15% ) , china ( 4% ) , and brazil ( 3% ) .
the united states has more than double the farmland base ( over 1 billion acres versus about 457 million acres in the eu ) , while the eu has more than six times the number of farms ( 13.8 million versus 2.2 million ) spread across its 27 member countries ( table 2 ) .
both the united states and the eu provide significant government support to their agricultural sectors .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , in 2009 the eu and the united states together accounted for 60% of all government support to agriculture among the major developed economies .
in addition to the difficulties inherent in defining what constitutes support , or even what constitutes agriculture , direct spending comparisons of agricultural support levels between the u.s. and eu also are complicated by significant structural differences in their respective farm sectors .
when the definition of support includes non - monetary forms of support such as trade barriers and border measures , then the difference in support levels is still greater .
in the united states , federal farm policy has traditionally focused on price and income support programs concentrated on row crops including grains , oilseeds , cotton , as well as dairy .
when the comparison is limited to the most market - distorting types of direct farm subsidies during the same period , then the levels are smaller but the difference is much greater ( $36.9 billion in eu outlays versus $10.1 billion in u.s. outlays , for a ratio of 3.6 to 1 ) .
for example , when using a broad , inclusive definition of the agricultural sector ( one that encompasses rural development and consumer nutrition assistance ) , then during the 2006-2007 period the eu spent an average of $119.7 billion per year in total government outlays , compared with $86.2 billion by the united states for a ratio of 1.4 to 1 ( table 2 and table 4 ) .
as a result , eu outlays per unit of land appear much larger than in the united states , whereas u.s. outlays per farm appear much larger than in the eu .
the technological scale of agricultural production also varies dramatically across the eu's 27 member nations , thus adding to the difficulty of generalizing about eu farm policy effects in comparison with u.s. farm policy .
