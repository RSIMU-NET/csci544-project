communities are allowed to use their cdbg disaster recovery ( cdbg - dr ) grants to address a wide range of unmet recovery needs — losses not met with insurance or other forms of assistance , including federal disaster assistance — related to housing , infrastructure , and economic revitalization .
in response to the damage caused by the 2017 hurricanes , congress has provided $35.4 billion in supplemental appropriations through the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) community development block grant ( cdbg ) program to help affected communities recover .
specifically , this report examines ( 1 ) the status of the 2017 cdbg - dr grants ; ( 2 ) the steps the 2017 cdbg - dr grantees have taken to establish financial processes and procedures , build capacity , and estimate unmet needs ; ( 3 ) the extent to which hud has reviewed the steps that grantees have taken and developed plans for future monitoring ; and ( 4 ) the challenges hud and grantees have faced in administering grants .
as of february 2019 , hud had awarded approximately $19.9 billion of the cdbg - dr funds to puerto rico , $9.8 billion to texas , $1.9 billion to the u.s. virgin islands , and $1.3 billion to florida .
some questions have been raised about the administration of cdbg - dr funds for prior disasters , including grantees' capacity to administer the funds and ability to adhere to procurement requirements .
congress required that hud certify , in advance of making a grant , that the designated grantees had sufficient financial controls , procurement processes , and procedures to prevent duplication of benefits .
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has estimated the total cost of these three major 2017 hurricanes at $265 billion , placing them among the top five costliest hurricanes on record in the united states , along with hurricanes katrina and sandy .
when disasters occur , congress often appropriates additional cdbg funding ( cdbg - dr ) through supplemental appropriations .
the 2017 hurricanes caused the most damage in puerto rico , texas , the u.s. virgin islands , and florida .
to determine the status of the 2017 cdbg - dr grants , we reviewed relevant laws and the federal register notices allocating the cdbg - dr funds and interviewed hud officials to determine the steps grantees were required to take before signing a grant agreement and expending their 2017 cdbg - dr funds .
to determine how much cdbg - dr funding the 2017 grantees had drawn down , we examined data from the disaster recovery grant reporting system , a hud database of cdbg - dr funding , reported expenditures , and other information .
three historic hurricanes made landfall in the united states in 2017 and affected nearly 26 million people .
