concerned by reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act ( fisma ) of 2002 , which permanently authorized and strengthened information security program , evaluation , and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies .
in my testimony today , i will summarize ( 1 ) the status of agency performance of information security control activities as reported by major agencies and their inspectors general ( ig ) , ( 2 ) the effectiveness of information security at federal agencies , and ( 3 ) opportunities to improve federal information security .
however , five years after fisma was enacted , we continue to report that poor information security is a widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences .
over the past few years , federal agencies have reported numerous security incidents in which sensitive information has been lost or stolen , including personally identifiable information , which has exposed millions of americans to a loss of privacy , identity theft , and other financial crimes .
the need for a vigilant approach to information security is demonstrated by the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents , the wide availability of hacking tools , and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology .
since 1997 , we have identified information security as a governmentwide high - risk issue in each of our biennial reports to the congress .
it is especially important for government agencies , where the public's trust is essential .
in preparing for this testimony , we analyzed the office of management and budget's ( omb ) fisma report for fiscal year 2007 and the annual fisma reports and the performance and accountability reports for 24 major federal agencies ; examined agency , ig , and our reports on information security ; and reviewed omb fisma reporting instructions , information technology ( it ) security guidance , and information on reported security incidents .
information security is a critical consideration for any organization that depends on information systems and computer networks to carry out its mission or business .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss information security over federal systems .
as federal information systems increase their connectivity with other networks and the internet and as the system capabilities continue to increase , federal systems will become increasingly more vulnerable .
thus , protecting federal computer systems and the systems that support critical infrastructures has never been more important .
we conducted our work , in support of this testimony , from february 2008 through march 2008 , in the washington , d.c. area .
intentional threats include both targeted and nontargeted attacks .
omb and certain federal agencies have initiated efforts that are intended to strengthen the protection of federal information and information systems .
unintentional threats can be caused by software upgrades or maintenance procedures that inadvertently disrupt systems .
opportunities exist to improve information security at federal agencies .
current performance measures offer limited assurance of the quality of agency processes that implement key security policies , controls , and practices .
critical operations could be disrupted , such as those supporting national defense and emergency services or agencies' missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents , resulting in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct operations and fulfill their responsibilities .
