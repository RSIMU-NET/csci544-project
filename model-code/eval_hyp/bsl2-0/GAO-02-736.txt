specifically , we ( 1 ) determined the circumstances under which the committee formally investigates acquisitions and ( 2 ) identified weaknesses in the committee's process for implementing exon - florio that limit its effectiveness .
the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions , mergers , or takeovers of u.s. companies if ( 1 ) there is credible evidence that a foreign controlling interest might threaten national security and ( 2 ) legislation , other than exon - florio and the international emergency economic powers act , does not adequately or appropriately protect national security .
in response to your request , we examined the process by which the committee on foreign investment in the united states reviews and investigates foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies .
in 1992 , the law was amended to require that the president report all cases requiring a presidential determination to the congress .
the president delegated the authority to review foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies to an interagency group , the committee on foreign investment in the united states .
previously , the law required a report only when the president took action to block an acquisition .
the president has 15 days to decide whether to allow the acquisition to proceed or to suspend or prohibit it .
implementing regulations require that the committee undertake an initial 30-day review after receiving a voluntary submission from the companies involved in an acquisition .
if the committee decides during this 30-day review that there could be credible evidence to support the belief that the acquisition may threaten national security , the committee can initiate a 45-day investigation .
after completing the investigation , the committee submits a recommendation to the president .
likewise , when agreements are concluded to mitigate national security concerns , the lack of specificity in actions called for by the agreements and the uncertain responsibility for implementing and monitoring make assuring compliance difficult .
allowing companies to withdraw notification to the committee when an acquisition has already occurred without instituting interim protections risks the very harm to national security that exon - florio was enacted to prevent .
further , to ensure compliance with agreements concluded under the authority of exon - florio , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury , in his capacity as chair of the committee on foreign investment in the united states , ( 1 ) increase the specificity of actions required by mitigation measures in future agreements negotiated under the authority of exon - florio and ( 2 ) designate in the agreement the agency responsible for overseeing implementation and monitoring compliance with mitigation measures .
in view of the need to assure that national security is protected during the period that withdrawal is allowed for companies that have completed or plan to complete the acquisition prior to the committee completing its work , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury , in his capacity as chair of the committee on foreign investment in the united states , revise implementing regulations to require specific interim protections prior to allowing withdrawal for companies that have completed or plan to complete the acquisition before the committee has completed its work .
exon - florio and implementing regulations provide the committee with broad discretion to evaluate and make decisions about issues of potential national security risk .
