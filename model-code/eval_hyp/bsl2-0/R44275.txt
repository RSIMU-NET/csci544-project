as congress examines puerto rico's finances , questions have arisen about how federal health care programs ( medicare , medicaid , and the state children's health insurance program [chip] ) and private health insurance reforms apply to puerto rico .
this report provides answers to frequently asked questions ( faqs ) about how federal health care programs and requirements are implemented in puerto rico , including eligibility , coverage , program requirements , and payment rules .
p uerto rico's financial circumstances , including uncertainty about its ability to service its large public debt , have drawn attention in recent months .
examples provided in the faqs illustrate that in many circumstances , health programs in puerto rico differ from programs in the 50 states and the district of columbia ( dc ) , while in other circumstances , puerto rico is treated the same as the states .
as such , these questions and answers should be viewed as a discussion of the complexity of health care financing as it relates to puerto rico under current law .
it then examines puerto rico's treatment under medicare , medicaid , and chip and concludes with a look at how federal requirements for private health insurance apply to puerto rico .
this report will be updated as additional relevant questions and answers arise .
is puerto rico treated like a state , or is it treated differently ? .
this faq begins with a brief background on the demographics and economics of puerto rico .
in fy2014 , medicaid is estimated to have provided health care services to 63 million individuals at a total cost of $494 billion , with the federal government paying $299 billion ( about 61% ) of that total .
this flexibility results in variability across medicaid programs .
historically , medicaid eligibility generally has been limited to certain low - income populations , such as children , pregnant women , parents of dependent children , the elderly , and individuals with disabilities .
these questions provide context for the federal health care program rules applied to puerto rico and their implications .
however , the aca included the aca medicaid expansion provision , which extends medicaid eligibility to individuals under the age of 65 with income up to 133% of fpl , at state option .
this section addresses questions about puerto rico's population and key economic features .
medicaid is a joint federal - state program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services , as well as long - term services and supports ( ltss ) , for a diverse low - income population , including children , pregnant women , adults , individuals with disabilities , and people aged 65 and older .
to participate in medicaid , the federal government requires states and dc to cover certain mandatory populations and benefits , but it allows states and dc to cover optional populations and services .
although in many cases 2014 is the most recent data year for which data are available , some statistics represent outcomes in 2013 ( e.g. , national economic data ) and 2016 ( e.g. , labor force data ) .
the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) is a means - tested program that provides health coverage to targeted low - income children and pregnant women in families that have annual income above medicaid - eligibility levels but have no health insurance .
