 ( 2 ) what are medicare health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) doing to improve delivery of recommended diabetes services ? .
the medicare preventive benefit improvement act of 1997 ( h.r .
 ( 3 ) what activities does the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) support to address these service needs for medicare beneficiaries with diabetes ? .
we focused our review on the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent are medicare beneficiaries with diabetes receiving recommended levels of preventive and monitoring services ? .
very few plans have developed comprehensive diabetes management programs .
diabetes is a prevalent , costly , chronic disease that has substantial effects on the medicare program: at least 1 in 10 beneficiaries is diagnosed with diabetes , and on average these beneficiaries cost medicare considerably more than those without diabetes .
prevention for diabetes aims to slow the disease's progression through screening , monitoring , and treating conditions to keep them from worsening and becoming more costly .
15 , introduced jan. 7 , 1997 ) proposes new medicare coverage for a number of preventive services , including diabetes outpatient self - management training , and for blood - testing strips that people with diabetes use to monitor their blood glucose control .
most experts agree that preventive care — including both appropriate medical management and patient self - management — can improve the quality of life for people with diabetes , and it may help control costs .
the efforts of medicare hmos to improve diabetes care have been varied but generally limited , with most plans reporting that they have focused on educating their enrollees with diabetes about self - management and their physicians about the need for preventive and monitoring services .
while we did not specifically assess these proposals , our findings on the use of diabetes preventive and monitoring services should contribute to deliberations on this legislation .
at your request , we examined how well the health care system provides preventive services to medicare beneficiaries with diabetes .
at the federal level , hcfa has targeted diabetes for special emphasis and has begun to test preventive care initiatives ; but like the hmos , hcfa's efforts are quite recent and the agency does not yet have results that would allow it to evaluate effectiveness .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss our recent report on preventive and monitoring services provided to medicare beneficiaries with diabetes .
we also surveyed 88 hmo plans serving medicare beneficiaries on their approaches to preventive diabetes care and conducted follow - up interviews with 12 of those plans .
this is true both in traditional fee - for - service medicare , which serves about 90 percent of all beneficiaries , and in managed care delivery .
to respond to these questions , we identified a representative sample of more than 168,000 people with diabetes in the medicare fee - for - service program and reviewed their service claims records for 1994 .
among hmos , where coordinated care and prevention are expected to receive special emphasis , many plans are exploring ways to improve diabetes management ; but providers may be reluctant to invest in expensive approaches until their cost - effectiveness is more evident .
