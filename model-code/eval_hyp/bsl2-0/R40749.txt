specifically , recently introduced health reform bills have included a strong focus on supporting and expanding a coordinated national quality measurement infrastructure .
policy makers and others have offered a wide range of policy options to improve health care quality .
these include efforts that would broadly support the development of national priorities in the area of performance measurement ; the development of new quality measures and identification of gaps in existing measures ; the expansion of the endorsement process for quality measures ; and the delineation of a process , in rulemaking , for selecting and implementing new quality measures for use in public health care programs .
it provides a discussion of the definition of quality measurement and a description of the life cycle of quality measures , including the development of quality measures ( across provider types ) ; the process of endorsement of quality measures ; and the process for implementing those measures .
this issue now occupies a prominent position on the national agenda for health care reform and is the subject of considerable congressional interest .
overviews of selected examples of implementation , including the physician quality reporting initiative ( pqri ) and the reporting hospital quality data for annual payment update ( rhqdapu ) , are included .
this report provides information on the issue of quality measurement , which serves as the basis of several of the options policy makers are offering for addressing this problem .
this report begins with a brief description of health care quality activity conceptually , the types of quality information that support these activities , and how quality measurement can be placed within these frameworks .
the release of the iom report represented a changing approach to addressing suboptimal health care quality , from one focused primarily on quality assurance to one focused on quality improvement broadly through the realignment of systems of delivering and financing care to incentivize quality of care .
the report concludes with an overview of key technical and policy issues in quality measurement .
problems with quality of health care in the united states earned the attention of the public with , and have steadily gained in importance since , the release of the first in a series of institute of medicine ( iom ) reports on this topic , "to err is human: building a safer health system," in 1999 .
especially in the context of health care reform , these issues may be useful to consider as congress develops policies aimed at improving health care quality .
the u.s. health care system is characterized by systemic quality shortcomings .
some of these issues are discussed in more detail below .
the complexity of quality measurement , and the importance of its potential applications , has generated a number of policy and technical issues in terms of both measure development and implementation .
the u.s health care system's quality problems are evidenced by a broad range of relevant quality indicators .
significant activity has been undertaken to improve the quality of care delivered in the united states over the past decade , but a number of concerning trends remain .
quality problems are everywhere , affecting many patients .
a july 2008 study reports that despite spending two times more per capita than any other major industrialized country on health care , the united states has an amenable mortality rate — deaths that are amenable to health care intervention and may have been prevented by that intervention — of 110 per 100,000 ( ranking 19 th out of 19 surveyed countries ) .
