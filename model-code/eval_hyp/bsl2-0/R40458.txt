no similar provision was included in the most recent piece of major fda legislation , the fda amendments act of 2007 ( fdaaa ) .
the fda's guidance contains provisions similar to , and potentially more expansive than , the provisions on dissemination of information on off - label uses in ยง 401 of the fda modernization act of 1997 ( fdama ) , which expired in 2006 .
first , this report outlines the relevant provisions of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) and related regulations that have been used to address misbranding violations of the act that relate to pharmaceutical manufacturers' promotion of off - label use .
second , the report summarizes the fda's previous off - label marketing provisions under fdama ยง 401 , which are no longer in effect .
fourth , the report outlines first amendment challenges to fdama and older fda guidance documents addressing off - label promotion .

on january 13 , 2009 , the food and drug administration ( fda ) issued a notice in the federal register regarding the availability of its guidance for industry on the distribution of medical journal articles and scientific publications regarding unapproved new uses ( also known as off - label uses ) of approved drugs .
third , the report details the january 2009 guidance document and its similarities to and differences from the fdama provisions .
the guidance seemingly creates a safe harbor for dissemination of information on off - label uses of fda - approved drugs .
sixth , the report provides an overview of the false claims act ( fca ) and related qui tam cases that addressed off - label marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies .
finally , the report analyzes the interaction of the new guidance document and the fca .
fda rules may be subject to legal challenges .
this section addresses administrative law principles that may come into play in the event that the fda's guidance is implemented or enforced in a manner that would render it a binding rule that should have been promulgated under the provisions of the administrative procedure act ( apa ) .
additionally , this section addresses the question of whether the fda had the authority to issue such a guidance document , due to the expiration of the fdama provisions .
assuming that the fda has the authority to issue the guidance , these provisions may face a first amendment challenge .
fdama ยง 401 and the earlier 1996 fda guidance documents ( both of which addressed permissible methods for the dissemination of information about "off - label" uses by drug manufacturers ) have been challenged on first amendment grounds .
indeed , the legislative history indicates that congress specifically contemplated the use of the act to address regulatory violations .
therefore , the court concluded that congress did not intend "to preclude fca claims by authorizing the fcc to grant relief for violations of fcc regulations. .
the washington legal foundation ( wlf ) , a nonprofit group that advocates against excessive government regulation , challenged earlier fda guidance documents ( issued in 1996 ) dealing with the distribution of enduring materials by drug manufacturers .
