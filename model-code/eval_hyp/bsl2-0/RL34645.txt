investment in federal energy technology r&d programs of the 1970s , in response to two energy crises , have generally been viewed as less successful than the earlier two efforts .
some policymakers have concluded that the energy challenges facing the united states are so critical that a concentrated investment in energy research and development ( r&d ) should be undertaken .
the manhattan project , which produced the atomic bomb , and the apollo program , which landed american men on the moon , have been cited as examples of the success such r&d investments can yield .
this report compares and contrasts the goals of , and the investments in , the three initiatives , which may provide useful insights for congress as it assesses and debates the nation's energy policy .
the activities with the greatest cost were the saturn v rockets ( $6.4 billion in current dollars ) followed by the command and service modules ( $3.7 billion ) , the lunar modules ( $2.2 billion ) , and manned space flight operations ( $1.6 billion ) .
in terms of federal outlays , energy technology r&d funding would need to increase from 0.5% to 1% ( manhattan project ) or 2.2 % ( apollo program ) of federal outlays .
according to nasa , the total cost of the apollo program for fy1960-fy1973 was $19.4 billion ( $97.9 billion in 2008 dollars ) .
nasa's peak funding during the apollo program occurred in fy1966 when its total funding was $4.5 billion ( in current dollars ) , of which $3.0 billion went to the apollo program .
to be equivalent of peak year funding would require even greater increases .
a general understanding of driving forces of and funding histories for the manhattan project and apollo program , and a comparison of these two initiatives to department of energy ( doe ) energy technology r&d programs , may provide useful insights for congress as it assesses and determines the nation's energy r&d policy .
when the manhattan project and the apollo program are used as analogies for future doe energy technology r&d , the following points may be important to consider: to be equivalent in annual average funding , doe energy technology r&d funding would need to increase from approximately $3 billion in fy2008 to at least $4 billion per program year to match the manhattan project funding , or $7 billion per program year to match apollo program funding levels or doe energy technology r&d funding at its peak .
both the manhattan project and the apollo program goals pointed to technologies primarily for governmental use with little concern about their environmental impact ; for energy , in contrast , the hoped for outcome depends on commercial viability and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the energy technologies developed .
rather , energy technology r&d has been driven by at least three not always commensurate goals — resource and technological diversity , commercial viability , and environmental protection — which were not goals of the historical programs .
although the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful analogies for funding , these differences may limit their utility regarding energy policy .
