significant weaknesses in federal and state nursing home oversight that we identified in a series of reports and testimonies since 1998 included ( 1 ) periodic state inspections , known as surveys , that understated the extent of serious care problems due to procedural weaknesses , ( 2 ) considerable state delays in investigating public complaints alleging harm to residents , ( 3 ) federal enforcement policies that did not ensure deficiencies were addressed and remained corrected , and ( 4 ) federal oversight of state survey activities that was limited in scope and effectiveness .
in july 1998 , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) — the federal agency with responsibility for managing medicare and medicaid and overseeing compliance with federal nursing home quality standards — launched a series of actions intended to address many of the weaknesses we identified .
since 1998 , the agency has worked to strengthen surveyors' ability to detect quality - of - care deficiencies ; required states to investigate complaints alleging resident harm within 10 days ; mandated immediate sanctions for nursing homes with a pattern of harming residents ; and begun measuring state compliance with federal survey requirements and reviewing data on the results of state surveys to help pinpoint shortcomings in state survey activities .
to evaluate the extent of the progress made in improving the quality of nursing home care since we last addressed this issue in september 2000 , you asked us to assess: trends in measured nursing home quality ; state responses to previously identified weaknesses in their survey , complaint , and enforcement activities ; and the status of key federal efforts to oversee state survey agency performance and improve quality .
as we previously reported , poor quality of care at about 15 percent of the nation's approximately 17,000 nursing homes — an unacceptably high proportion — had repeatedly caused actual harm to residents , such as worsening pressure sores or untreated weight loss , or had placed them at risk of death or serious injury .
to assess recent trends in measured nursing home quality , we analyzed survey results for the period july 11 , 2000 , through january 31 , 2002 , and compared them to survey results for two earlier 18-month periods: ( 1 ) january 1 , 1997 , through june 30 , 1998 , and ( 2 ) january 1 , 1999 , through july 10 , 2000 .
our analysis relied on data from the centers for medicare & medicaid services' ( cms ) on - line survey , certification , and reporting ( oscar ) system , which compiles the results of all state nursing home surveys nationwide .
a number of congressional hearings since july 1998 have focused considerable attention on the need to improve the quality of care for the nation's 1.7 million nursing home residents , a highly vulnerable population of elderly and disabled individuals .
our review of deficiencies from these survey reports focused on the types of quality - of - care deficiencies most frequently cited nationwide .
to assess state survey activities as well as federal oversight , we analyzed the conduct and results of fiscal year 2001 state survey agency performance reviews during which cms regional offices determined state compliance with seven federal standards ; we focused on the five standards related to statutory survey intervals , survey documentation , complaint activities , enforcement requirements , and oscar data entry .
