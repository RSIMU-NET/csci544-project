our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) determine labor's role in facilitating the states' it modernization efforts , ( 2 ) identify and describe the types of federal funding selected states have spent on it modernization , ( 3 ) provide the status of modernization efforts for the selected states , ( 4 ) determine key modernization challenges , and ( 5 ) determine what management controls have been established for it modernization .
in carrying out these key responsibilities , the state agencies rely heavily on information technology ( it ) , including benefits and tax systems .
we also selected states developing individual systems , those developing integrated tax and benefits systems , and states involved in consortium efforts .
to identify and describe the types of federal funding selected states have spent on it modernization , we analyzed states' expenditure data , such as funding allocations and spending reports .
to administer the program , state agencies must , among other things , collect state unemployment taxes , determine eligibility and benefits amounts , and pay unemployment benefits .
given the importance of it to state agencies' abilities to effectively process and provide timely ui benefits to millions of unemployed americans , you requested that we examine states' efforts to modernize the systems supporting their ui programs .
to determine labor's role in facilitating the modernization efforts , we analyzed documentation describing its responsibilities , including regulations , department project plans , and program guidance .
as a federal - state partnership , the framework of the program is determined by federal law , and benefits for individuals are dependent on state law and administered by state workforce agencies .
we also interviewed labor officials responsible for overseeing states' ui programs to further clarify the department's role .
further , to determine the status of modernization efforts for the selected states , we reviewed the states' modernization project plans and status reports , and interviewed officials responsible for ui technology .
to determine key modernization challenges , we analyzed public reports and interviewed relevant officials from labor and the nine states regarding issues encountered while initiating and developing the states' efforts to modernize the ui systems .
to accomplish our objectives , we selected and examined the it modernization efforts of nine states .
the program , which is administered by the department of labor ( labor ) in partnership with the states , has been particularly essential in the wake of the recent recession and slow pace of economic recovery: in fiscal year 2011 , $116.8 billion was spent to provide temporary , partial compensation for lost earnings of individuals who became unemployed through no fault of their own .
while the sample was nongeneralizable , the selected states offered insight and perspective on their experiences in modernizing ui systems , including sources of funding , challenges , and established management controls .
however , a july 2010 state survey noted that most of the it systems used for the ui program were old and based on outmoded programming languages , were costly and difficult to support , and could not efficiently handle workload demands .
the unemployment insurance ( ui ) program is our nation's largest income maintenance program , with its benefits serving as a critical source of income for millions of unemployed americans .
