in administering federal tax laws , the internal revenue service ( irs ) collected approximately $2.35 trillion in 2010 and is projected to collect over $3 trillion beginning in 2013 .
to better understand the implications of moving to the new strategy , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine whether irs has identified the expected benefits of cade 2 and set targets for measuring success , ( 2 ) examine the estimated costs of the program and assess irs's process for developing them , and ( 3 ) assess irs's process for managing the risks associated with cade 2 and describe the risks irs has identified using this process .
to do so , irs depends heavily on information technology ( it ) systems , including legacy tax processing systems that were developed in the 1960s that are complex and difficult to maintain .
however , irs found that the development of the system was more complex and taking longer than initially anticipated and decided to undertake a broad review of its it systems modernization efforts .
to describe the expected benefits , we reviewed relevant documents , including the cade 2 program business case and benefits management plan , and interviewed irs officials from the offices of wage and investment ( w&i ) and modernization and information technology services ( mits ) .
in 1999 , irs initiated the customer account data engine ( cade ) project to replace legacy systems for storing , managing , and accessing taxpayer accounts .
the new strategy is referred to as cade 2 .
the results of the review led irs to adopt a new strategy for managing individual taxpayer accounts that would provide benefits to irs and the taxpayers sooner than cade .
starting in 2005 , cade processed and recorded tax return and tax account information for millions of individual taxpayers with simple returns .
we evaluated irs's risk management process against relevant criteria in the software engineering institute's capability maturity model integration ( cmmi ) best practice guidance .
to determine cade 2 key risks and irs's management of them , we interviewed officials from the cade 2 program management office ( pmo ) and reviewed documentation associated with the risk management process and the identification of key risks .
to understand the estimated costs and assess irs's process for developing them , we reviewed agency cost documentation and compared it to the best practices identified in the gao cost estimating and assessment guide and interviewed officials from irs's estimation program office .
we also used program performance criteria established in our prior reports .
cade 2 is expected to deliver its functionality incrementally through three phases known as transition states .
several of the risks identified are significant and will require continued attention from irs .
appendix i contains further details on our objectives , scope , and methodology .
to its credit , irs has established a risk management process that is generally consistent with best practices and has identified mitigation strategies to address each identified risk .
table 2 shows the target completion dates and key characteristics for transition state 1 ( ts1 ) , transition state 2 ( ts2 ) , and the target state .
