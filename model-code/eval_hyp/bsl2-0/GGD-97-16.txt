consequently , cooperation between the internal revenue service ( irs ) and state tax agencies offers opportunities for helping to achieve irs' strategic goals of increasing taxpayers' compliance with tax laws , improving taxpayer service , reducing burden on taxpayers , and increasing the efficiency of tax administration .
irs and the states are aware of the advantages of working together and have been involved in a federal / state ( fedstate ) cooperative program for years .
this report discusses the potential benefits of the fedstate program , conditions that may impede the success of the program , and concerns raised by state officials regarding the potential impact of irs' latest reorganization of the fedstate program .
the income tax laws of many states are built upon the federal tax code .
data limitations prevented us from ascertaining whether the existing mix of fedstate projects has helped irs toward meeting its goals of improving compliance , increasing efficiency , and reducing taxpayer burden .
a project designed to increase compliance may also have the positive effect of reducing burden or increasing efficiency .
as a result , irs may be missing opportunities to target program efforts and maximize potential program benefits .
irs is facing budget reductions and downsizing .
more sophisticated technology provides additional ways for irs and the states to reduce taxpayer burden .
similarly , joint federal and state taxpayer education and assistance efforts can reduce taxpayer burden by making it easier for taxpayers to obtain information about tax requirements .
fedstate cooperative efforts provide irs and the states with opportunities to increase taxpayer compliance , improve taxpayer service , reduce taxpayer burden , and improve the efficiency of tax administration activities .
the proposed legislation would allow irs and state taxing agencies to delegate tax administration powers and compensate one another pursuant to agreements .
finally , some state tax officials are concerned that irs' reorganization of its district offices may impede or even end the long - standing relationships with irs district officials that have made cooperative fedstate projects possible .
further , irs has not developed performance goals for the fedstate program and has not collected data on most programs to monitor or assess program progress and results .
irs and the states have been involved in cooperative tax administration efforts since the 1920s .
our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify the potential benefits of fedstate cooperative efforts ; ( 2 ) determine what , if any , conditions may impede the success of the program ; and ( 3 ) determine what , if any , fedstate program concerns the states have with irs' planned reorganization .
by engaging in cooperative efforts , state agencies and the federal government have attempted to achieve greater compliance and efficiency than they could by working separately .
because of decreasing resources , it becomes even more important to identify ways that irs and the states can cooperate to improve efficiencies and maximize their return on investment .
more than half of the states have based their income tax systems on the federal tax system , with an overlap of many taxpayers .
due to the similarities in the functions of irs and state revenue departments , numerous opportunities exist to improve tax administration efficiencies through fedstate cooperative efforts .
