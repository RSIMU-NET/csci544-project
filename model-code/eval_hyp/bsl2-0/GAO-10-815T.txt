recently , several legislative and economic changes have affected tanf .
following dra , the u.s. economy experienced a severe recession and , in response , the congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) which included provisions affecting tanf such as the creation of a $5 billion emergency contingency fund for state tanf programs .
first , with the reauthorization of the tanf block grant through the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) , the congress took steps generally expected to strengthen tanf work requirements by modifying the credit provided to states for reducing the number of families receiving tanf .
states qualify for this fund based on increases in expenditures for short – term non - recurrent benefits or subsidized employment or increases in the number of families receiving cash assistance .
my remarks today — based primarily on our february and may 2010 reports — will focus on the following three issues: ( 1 ) key changes made to state welfare programs in response to tanf and other legislation and the effect of these changes on caseload trends ; ( 2 ) how single parent families with children are faring , including those who receive tanf cash assistance as well as those who are eligible but do not receive assistance ; and ( 3 ) the implications of recent developments on monitoring state tanf programs .
more recently , however , caseloads have begun to rise in some states .
central to tanf's focus on employment and self - sufficiency are tanf's work participation rate requirements , which require states to involve a minimum percentage of their families receiving tanf cash assistance in work activities for a required number of hours each week .
this fund supplemented the tanf contingency fund , which under prwora had made up to $2 billion available to states .
furthermore , while states have devoted significant amounts of the block grant funds as well as state funds to other activities , little is known about use of these funds .
within certain limitations , states set their own eligibility limits and benefit levels for cash recipients , but they must restrict most families to a lifetime limit of 60 months of federally funded tanf cash assistance .
recent changes in state tanf programs made in response to dra as well as changes in the economy have raised questions about how the program has affected low - income families over time and how best to monitor tanf's progress in meeting two of its key goals — to provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives and to end the dependence of needy families on government benefits by promoting job preparation , work , and marriage .
under the tanf block grant program , states receive a capped amount of federal funds to design and operate their own welfare programs within federal guidelines .
as you know , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) introduced sweeping changes to federal welfare policy .
states' use of the modifications allowed in federal law and regulations , as well as states' policy choices , have diminished the rates' usefulness as the national performance measure for tanf , and shown it to be limited as an incentive for states to engage more families or work with families with complex needs .
