congress further boosted funding for several global health programs , including $315million for hiv / aids and $60 million for malaria control .
moreover , p.l.106-429 fully funds several top administration priorities , including $435 million forinternational debt relief under the heavily indebted poor country ( hipc ) initiative .
among the most significant funding and policy issues raised during congressional debate in 2000 on the foreign operations appropriation measure wereconflicting executive - legislative branch development assistance strategy prioritiesand new administration initiatives , restrictions on international family planningprograms , regional and country aid allocations , and efforts by the administration tosecure funding to reduce debt burdens of the poorest developing countries .
for the most controversial fy2001 foreign operations issue - internationalfamily planning - congress increased spending to $425 million .
many of these provisions are opposed by the administration asexcessively limiting its ability to manage american foreign policy .
the enacted legislation falls about $550million , or 3.5% , below the president's combined fy2000 supplemental / fy2001requests , but is substantially higher than the roughly $13.4 billion spendingmeasures passed by the house and senate during the summer .
thelegislative - executive policy differences have in the past delayed the enactment of theforeign operations bill or have prompted a presidential veto .
the spending measure includes both regular fy2001requested programs as well as selected fy2000 supplemental funding proposals thatcongress had rejected earlier in the year .

many of these policy provisions take the formof conditions or restrictions on how the president can use money included in thespending bill .
lawmakers,however , restricted the obligation of funds until after february 15 , 2001 .
in addition to funding decisions made by congress in the foreign operationsappropriation bill , the annual spending measure also includes a wide range of policyprovisions that frequently raise contentious foreign policy disagreements between thepresident and congress .
aseparate statement from the president's press secretary stated that president bushwas "committed to maintaining the $425 million funding level" for populationassistance "because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is byproviding quality voluntary family planning services. .

onjanuary 22 , 2001 , two days after taking office , president george w. bush issued amemorandum to the usaid administrator directing him to "reinstate in full all ofthe requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 , 1993. .
as mentioned above , because congress has not enactedforeign aid authorization bills for over a decade , the foreign operationsappropriations legislation often becomes the vehicle for debate on the conduct ofu.s .
as aresult , foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriationscommittees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues andplayed a major role in shaping , authorizing , and guiding both executive andcongressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives .
