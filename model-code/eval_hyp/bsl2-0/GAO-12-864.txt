the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) authorized the creation of a type of medicare advantage ( ma ) plan referred to as a special needs plan ( snp ) , to address the unique needs of certain medicare populations .
disproportionate spending for these individuals is largely because dual - eligible beneficiaries are more likely than other medicare beneficiaries to be disabled ; report poor health status and limitations in their activities of daily living , such as bathing and toileting ; and have cognitive impairments , mental disorders , and certain chronic conditions such as diabetes and pulmonary disease .
in addition , dual - eligible beneficiaries' health care services must be coordinated across medicare and medicaid , and each program has its own set of covered services , provider networks , regulations , and payment policies .
about 1.2 million of the dual - eligible population is enrolled in dual - eligible snps ( d - snp ) , which are snps exclusively for dual - eligible beneficiaries .
in the same year , dual - eligible beneficiaries were about 15 percent of medicaid enrollees but accounted for nearly 40 percent of medicaid spending .
dual - eligible beneficiaries may also choose to enroll in other types of snps for which they are eligible , including institutional snps ( i - snp ) for individuals residing in nursing facilities or institutions , chronic condition snps ( c - snp ) for individuals with severe or disabling chronic conditions , or other ma plans , or remain in medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) .
in 2007 , these individuals , referred to as dual - eligible beneficiaries , made up 18 percent of all medicare beneficiaries but accounted for 31 percent of medicare spending .
standardizing measures could also reduce cms's administrative efforts by streamlining review of d - snps .
in addition to meeting all the requirements of other ma plans , all snps , including d - snps , are required by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers medicare and oversees medicaid — to provide specialized services targeted to the needs of their beneficiaries , including a health risk assessment and an interdisciplinary care team for each beneficiary enrolled .
in this report , we ( 1 ) describe the characteristics and health status of dual - eligible beneficiaries in d - snps and how they compare to those of dual - eligible beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs , ( 2 ) determine the extent to which d - snps' specialized services differ from those offered by other ma plans , and ( 3 ) describe how d - snps work with state medicaid agencies to enhance benefit integration and care coordination for dual - eligible beneficiaries .
about 9 million of medicare's over 48 million beneficiaries are also eligible for medicaid , a joint federal - state program that finances health insurance coverage for certain categories of low - income adults and children .
we also used cms's 2012 bid pricing tool data , which contain information ma plans submitted to cms on their projected revenue requirements for providing medicare - covered services to enrolled beneficiaries , to understand how d - snps and other ma plans fund the supplemental benefits they offer .
