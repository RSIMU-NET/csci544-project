these “dose reconstructions” are developed by the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) under the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
in 2000 , congress enacted the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act to compensate those individuals who have developed cancer or other specified diseases related to on - the - job exposure to radiation and other hazards at these work sites .
labor considers the compensability of certain claims by relying on estimates of the likely radiation levels to which particular workers were exposed .
about $70 million was originally allocated to this contract , but this figure had increased to over $200 million by 2004 .
under subtitle b , determining the eligibility of claimants for compensation is a complex process , involving several federal agencies and a reconstruction of the historical evidence available .
for the last several decades , the department of energy and its predecessor agencies and contractors have employed thousands of individuals in secret and dangerous work in the atomic weapons industry .
however , this effort has been marked by delays and higher than originally anticipated costs and some concerns over the roles of the federal officials assigned by the secretary of hhs to oversee this work .
the department of labor must consider a claimant's case based on records of his or her employment and work activities , which are provided by the department of energy .
nonetheless , further improvements could be made to the oversight and planning of the contracted review .
 ( 2 ) have the agency's management controls and the advisory board's oversight been sufficient to ensure that the contract to review site profiles and dose reconstructions is adequately carried out ? .
in addition , while the contractor's monthly reports were modified to provide more detailed expenditure data , the lack of integrated and comprehensive data across the various tasks makes it more difficult for the advisory board to track the progress of the overall review or make adjustments to funding or deliverables across tasks .
to assist the advisory board meet its statutory responsibilities , we recommend that the secretary of hhs ( 1 ) direct the contracting and project officers to develop and share with the advisory board more integrated and comprehensive data on contractor spending levels compared to work completed and ( 2 ) consider the need for providing hhs staff to collect and analyze pertinent information that would help the advisory board comprehensively reexamine its long - term plan for assessing the niosh site profiles and dose reconstructions .
even though the advisory board has made numerous midcourse adjustments to the work of the contractor , the board has not comprehensively reexamined its long - term plan for the project to determine whether the plan needs to be modified in light of the knowledge gained over the past few years .
the law also allows the secretary of hhs to add additional groups of employees to the special exposure cohort .
we focused on three questions: ( 1 ) are the roles of key federal officials involved in the review of niosh's dose reconstructions sufficiently independent to assure the objectivity of the review ? .
because certain facilities are known to have exposed employees to radiation while keeping few records of individuals' exposure , their employees have been designated under the law as members of a “special exposure cohort,” and their claims may be paid without individual dose reconstructions .
