these issues , as well as the momentum toward managed care as employers' preferred method of paying for health care , have focused attention on the adequacy of mechanisms whereby hmo enrollees can raise and resolve disputes .
therefore , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) what elements are considered important to a system for processing hmo member complaints and appeals ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hmos' complaint and appeal systems contain these elements ; ( 3 ) what concerns consumers have regarding hmo complaint and appeal systems ; ( 4 ) what information is available on the number and types of complaints and appeals hmos receive from their members ; and ( 5 ) how , if at all , hmos use their complaint and appeal data .
for example , health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) generally restrict coverage to care from providers within the plan's network and further require that specialty care be recommended by the member's primary care gatekeeper .
additionally , as part of managing patient care , most managed care plans have adopted utilization review procedures .
similarly , many believe that plans with the ability to deny or reduce coverage for unauthorized services need a mechanism for members to seek review of claims that have been denied or covered at a lower than expected level of benefits .
unlike traditional indemnity insurance plans , many managed care plans limit coverage to services provided by the physicians and hospitals in the plan and require use of an authorization system .
because of these restrictions , many believe that hmos need to have a system for enrollees to express dissatisfaction with their care .
enrollees who become dissatisfied with aspects of their health care can send signals to their health plan in several ways .
although we did not evaluate how well these systems were performing , our report assesses whether the policies and procedures in place contain the features recommended by leading regulatory , industry , and consumer groups .
we selected states in various regions and with different levels of state regulation and hmo market penetration .
this approach offers an alternative to enrollees who may be reluctant to disenroll despite a problem with the health plan and affords plans an opportunity to be responsive to member concerns .
utilization review determines whether the physician's proposed course of medical treatment and proposed location are necessary , based on clinical criteria .
to address these issues , we interviewed officials and reviewed documents from a national managed care industry association , state insurance regulatory offices , national consumer advocacy groups , national business associations , and national health plan accrediting bodies .
 ( see app .
in selecting hmos , we sought a mix of plans reflecting different model types , enrollment size , and accreditation status .
a recent survey of consumers shows that many people experience difficulties with their health plans .
we define appeals as requests to have plan decisions , such as denials of authorization for services requested or denials of payment for services received , reversed .
 ( some hmos define these terms differently ; further , some hmos use the term grievance in place of , or in addition to , these terms. ) .
