recent security breaches at large information resellers such as choicepoint and lexisnexis have raised questions about how resellers and their federal customers handle people's personal information â€” especially whether their practices are fully consistent with widely accepted practices for protecting the privacy and security of personal information .
these principles , now widely accepted , include 7. individual participation , and 8. accountability .
in that report , we analyzed fiscal year 2005 contracts and other vehicles for the acquisition of personal information from information resellers by the departments of justice , homeland security ( dhs ) , and state and the social security administration ( ssa ) .
as you are aware , the ease and speed with which people's personal information can be collected by information resellers from a wide variety of sources and made available to government and other customers has accelerated with technological advances in recent years .
federal agency use of such information is governed primarily by the privacy act of 1974 , which requires that the use of personal information be limited to predefined purposes and involve only information germane to those purposes .
these principles , with some variation , are used by organizations to address privacy considerations in their business practices and are also the basis of privacy laws and related policies in many countries , including the united states , germany , sweden , australia , new zealand , and the european union .
the provisions of the privacy act , in turn , are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information , known as the fair information practices , which were first proposed in 1973 by a u.s. government advisory committee .
i appreciate the opportunity to discuss critical issues surrounding the federal government's purchase of personal information from businesses known as information resellers .
we also compared relevant agency guidelines and management policies and procedures to the fair information practices .
such determinations are a matter of policy based on balancing the public's right to privacy with the value of services provided by resellers to customers such as government agencies .
we also identified the extent to which reseller polices and procedures were consistent with the key privacy principles of the fair information practices and assessed the potential effect of any inconsistencies .
however , we did not attempt to determine whether or how information reseller practices should change .
our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
my testimony is based on a report that we are issuing today .
today , after a brief summary and a discussion of how the selected agencies use the personal information that they buy from resellers , my remarks will focus on the extent to which the agencies and resellers have policies and practices that reflect the fair information practices .
the e - government act of 2002 requires that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments ( pia ) .
information resellers provide services based on these technological advances .
security safeguards .
the major requirements for the protection of personal privacy by federal agencies come from the privacy act of 1974 and the privacy provisions of the e - government act of 2002 .
no single federal law governs all use or disclosure of personal information .
