in response to your request , this report addresses whether nasa has effectively ( 1 ) designed controls over steps nasa identified as key to its controlled equipment reutilization process , including equipment sent to disposal , and ( 2 ) implemented policies , controls , and processes to enhance equipment reutilization .
during this transition period , it will be crucial that nasa have the processes , systems , and controls in place to ensure maximum reutilization and effective management and control of its equipment .
during our review , nasa implemented its new integrated asset management property , plant , and equipment ( pp&e ) module on may 19 , 2008 , and we examined the initial implementation of this module .
however , we did not review or assess whether nasa followed best practices in customizing and implementing the pp&e module , which nasa designed to enhance visibility , accountability , and management of pp&e .
the implementation of its new space exploration policy — a renewed spirit of discovery: the president's vision for u.s. space exploration — and the planned retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 will require nasa to move into a period of major transition .
the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) stands at one of the most important crossroads it has faced since its inception in 1958 .
the planned retirement of the shuttle will require the agency to make disposal and reutilization decisions regarding over 1.2 million types of equipment , including “controlled equipment,” which is the focus of this report .
in conducting this review , we evaluated the design of key steps in nasa's reutilization process by reviewing and comparing nasa's equipment management policies and procedural guidance for equipment management and reutilization with federal property management regulations and other property management standards , including gao's standards for internal control , and assessed key aspects of pp&e module controls ; reviewed information regarding the equipment reutilization process at five centers , interviewed relevant nasa personnel to obtain their views on the equipment reutilization process and the design and implementation of the pp&e module in facilitating equipment reutilization , and observed nasa employees as they demonstrated the pp&e module's equipment management , search , and disposal capabilities ; and selected a statistical random sample of equipment recorded in nasa's legacy nasa equipment management system ( nems ) and visited five centers to determine whether equipment recorded as actively being used was accurately recorded and transferred to the pp&e module for reuse or disposal .
we conducted this performance audit from december 2007 through january 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
additional details of our scope and methodology are provided in appendix i .
strengthening nasa - wide oversight and monitoring controls and processes could help nasa managers more effectively oversee nasa's compliance with its policies and procedures .
we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
