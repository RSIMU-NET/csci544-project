second , bpca provides for the funding of the study of off - patent drugs by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) national institutes of health ( nih ) .
once a drug's patent or market exclusivity has expired , however , fda can still request pediatric drug studies for off - patent drugs .
when a drug has market exclusivity , it is protected from competition for a limited period , for example by prohibition on food and drug administration ( fda ) approval of a generic copy for marketing .
drug sponsors ( typically drug manufacturers ) may obtain 6 months of additional market exclusivity for drugs on which they have conducted pediatric studies in accordance with pertinent law and regulations .
in order to encourage the study of more drugs for pediatric use , congress passed the best pharmaceuticals for children act ( bpca ) in 2002 to provide marketing incentives to drug sponsors for conducting pediatric drug studies .
fda also reviews these pediatric drug study reports to see if the drug requires labeling changes .
bpca also included provisions designed to provide for the study of both on - patent and off - patent drugs that drug sponsors have declined to study .
as discussed with the committees of jurisdiction , we ( 1 ) assessed the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted under bpca for on - patent drugs , including when drug sponsors declined to conduct the studies ; ( 2 ) evaluated the impact of bpca on labeling of drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling was changed ; and ( 3 ) illustrated the range of diseases treated by the drugs studied under bpca .
our work focused on actions regarding these drugs prior to 2006 .
generally , pediatric exclusivity can only be granted to those drugs that are on - patent — that is , those that still have market exclusivity — and for which fda has issued a written request for pediatric drug studies .
when fda determines that a drug may provide health benefits to children , it may issue a written request to the drug sponsor to conduct pediatric drug studies .
under bpca , drug sponsors of on - patent drugs must accept or decline a written request .
drug sponsors of off - patent drugs are not required to respond to a written request .
this market exclusivity is known as pediatric exclusivity .
bpca required that we assess , among other things , the effect of provisions regarding pediatric drug studies on the study and proper labeling of drugs for pediatric use .
this has placed children taking drugs for which there have not been adequate pediatric drug studies at risk of being exposed to ineffective treatment or receiving incorrect dosing .
if fda is satisfied that the studies have been conducted and the report submitted as required , the drug in question may receive additional market exclusivity .
to assess the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted under bpca for on - patent drugs , including when drug sponsors declined to do the studies , we examined data about the drugs for which fda issued written requests from january 2002 through december 2005 .
