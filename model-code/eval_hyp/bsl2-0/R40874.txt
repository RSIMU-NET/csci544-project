less frequently addressed in proposed legislation is emission reduction for non - co 2 greenhouse gases , such as nitrous oxide ( n 2 o ) .
policymakers are dedicating considerable attention to greenhouse gas emission reduction , primarily discussing options for carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) emission reduction .
the five non - co 2 greenhouse gases regularly monitored but not entirely regulated by epa ( methane , nitrous oxide , hydroflourocarbons , perflourocarbons , and sulfur hexaflouride ) accounted for approximately 17% of u.s. greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions in 2009 , as measured by total tons of co 2 equivalent .
however , n 2 o reduction efforts have the potential to mitigate climate change .
no new legislation needs to be passed to regulate n 2 o for climate protection and ozone recovery .
nitrous oxide — the third - most abundant greenhouse gas — was responsible for roughly 4% of total u.s. ghg emissions in 2009 by weight .
strategies or technologies designated for n 2 o emission reduction are limited .
high costs and difficulty in measuring these products' efficacy , among other deterrents , have hampered widespread adoption of practices to reduce n 2 o emissions .
in addition to being one cause of greenhouse gas emission growth , n 2 o is an ozone - depleting substance ( ods ) .
moreover , n 2 o emission sources may be regulated under the existing clean air act as a class i or class ii ozone - depleting substance at the discretion of the environmental protection agency ( epa ) administrator .
the bulk of u.s. n 2 o emissions stem from fertilizing agricultural soils for crop production .
although they comprise a smaller portion of ghg emissions , non - co 2 greenhouse gases , including n 2 o , are more potent than co 2 .
the agriculture sector is the primary anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide .
n 2 o emission reduction could thus play a compelling role in recovery of the ozone layer as well as in greenhouse gas emission reduction .
more efficient application of synthetic fertilizers ( e.g. , precision agriculture , nitrogen inhibitors , nitrogen sensors , controlled - release fertilizer products ) is one way to reduce excess amounts of nitrogen available for bacterial processing and eventual release to the atmosphere as n 2 o .
indeed , scientific analysis suggests that n 2 o is now the leading ods being emitted , as emissions of other substances have been reduced significantly owing to regulations enacted in the late 1980s , in the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer .
in the agriculture sector , the majority of n 2 o is released as a consequence of specific nitrogen cycle processes ( nitrification and denitrification ) when large amounts of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are used for crop production .
the gases identified above are 21 to 23,900 times more effective than an equivalent weight of co 2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere , with n 2 o being 310 times more potent by weight .
policy options for n 2 o emission reduction , sources of n 2 o , and federal support to lower n 2 o emissions are discussed .
