most notably , in exercising its oversight responsibilities , the congress could use such information to examine whether the current structure and incentives of the federal insurance programs adequately address the challenges posed by potential increases in the frequency and severity of catastrophic weather events .
while the precise content of these analyses can be debated , the activities of many private insurers already suggest a number of strong possibilities that may be applicable to assessing the potential implications of climate change on the federal insurance programs .
but in any case , climate change , defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) as any change in the climate over time due to either natural variability or as a result of human activity , may affect social and economic activities in potentially profound ways — by raising sea levels , changing precipitation patterns , and altering the frequency or severity of weather - related events .
my testimony summarizes our report , focusing on ( 1 ) what is known about how climate change might affect the frequency and severity of damaging weather - related events , ( 2 ) the extent of the insured losses incurred by private and federal insurers and reinsurers resulting from weather - related events , and ( 3 ) what major federal agencies and private insurers and reinsurers are doing to prepare for the potential risk of increased losses .
much research and policy debate of late has centered on the extent to which human activities have contributed to this warming and accompanying changes in climate , and how much is due to natural variability .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , within the department of homeland security , is responsible for oversight and management of the nfip .
of particular concern , the global average surface temperature has increased by 1.3 degrees fahrenheit ( 0.74 degrees celsius ) over the past 100 years , and the national academy of sciences ( nas ) and other scientific organizations have concluded that available evidence points to continued , perhaps accelerating , increases over the next century .
some infrequent weather - related events — drought or hurricanes , for example — are so severe that they pose unique challenges for insurers and reinsurers .
the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) was established in 1968 to protect communities vulnerable to flood damage .
the public sector includes federal and state programs that were established as an alternative to disaster assistance in markets where private insurance markets did not exist , such as for crop losses , and for losses that private insurers had deemed uninsurable , such as flood damage .
any unanticipated changes in the frequency or severity of weather - related events can have financial consequences at the company level and industry - wide .
the federal crop insurance corporation ( fcic ) was established in 1938 to temper the economic impact of the great depression , and was significantly expanded in 1980 to protect farmers from the financial losses brought about by drought , flood , or other natural disasters .
accordingly , our report being released today recommends that the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of homeland security direct the administrator of the risk management agency and the under secretary of homeland security for emergency preparedness to analyze the potential long - term implications of climate change for the fcic and the nfip , respectively , and report their findings to the congress .
