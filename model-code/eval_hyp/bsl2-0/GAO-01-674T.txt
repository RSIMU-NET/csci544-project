at that time most states' budget forecasts predicted that the robust economy would continue providing strong revenue growth potential and , more important for states' temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) budgets , diminishing costs in many social services programs .
however , the flexibility of the grant combined with significant unspent tanf balances may help mitigate the fiscal fallout from economic downturns .
this could make tanf more sensitive to an economic downturn than aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) if former recipients return to the rolls when they are laid off , causing state tanf budgets to rise .
because states' new welfare programs remain untested in times of downturn , these uncertainties make it difficult for anyone to predict how states will respond and how former welfare recipients will be affected if and when economic conditions change .
the potential for states to draw on their tanf grants and state reserves to cushion fiscal and economic shocks to the program .
as economic forecasts have begun to change , there is some concern that the states might not be as prepared as they could be to manage the new fiscal challenges under welfare reform .
in 1998 we reported on states' plans for financing their welfare programs in the event that the economy unexpectedly turned down .
many adults have left the rolls for work since tanf was implemented — caseloads have dropped more than 50 percent nationwide — and those remaining on the rolls have increased their work efforts .
in today's testimony i plan to address three points: the shifting fiscal balance between the states and the federal government and the challenges this new partnership poses in financing and strengthening the safety net during times of economic stress .
the complexity in the design of existing tanf contingency mechanisms that limits the effectiveness of these mechanisms in responding to uncertainties in the economy .
despite the significant changes made to the nation's welfare program , the economy will no doubt play a role in determining how many people return to the welfare rolls and how long they , and those currently on the rolls , will remain if there are fewer job opportunities available .
in the block grant environment , the federal government has an interest in encouraging states to save for future contingencies , but within a framework that recognizes that the size of the reserve will remain largely a state determination made under conditions of inherent uncertainty .
furthermore , our case studies suggest that most states have done little planning for economic contingencies .
greater emphases on work implies a tighter link to work and hence the economy .
last year , this subcommittee asked us to revisit the states examined in our 1998 report and to , among other things , look anew at their contingency plans .
as we will discuss more fully later in this testimony , the data available on the levels and adequacy of states' reserves is insufficient and misleading .
finally , i would like to conclude with some options this subcommittee might consider that could lead to refinements in the new fiscal partnership on welfare , giving the states more incentives to save while maintaining the federal role in the safety net .
