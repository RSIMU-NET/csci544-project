the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , enacted in march 2010 , employer - sponsored health coverage indicate may affect employers' willingness to offer health coverage to their employees .
recent studies have predicted employers' responses to ppaca in terms of offering coverage once key ppaca provisions are in effect .
however , some researchers believe certain ppaca provisions that result in coverage from other sources — such as an expanded medicaid program and subsidized coverage for certain individuals who purchase coverage through new health insurance marketplaces called “exchanges” — may discourage employers from offering coverage .

researchers believe some provisions — such as financial penalties that certain employers with at least 50 full - time equivalent employees may face if they do not offer health coverage or if they offer coverage that does not meet certain minimum requirements , and an “individual mandate,” which will require most people to obtain health coverage or pay a tax penalty — may encourage employers to continue offering or newly offer health coverage .
the proportion of employers offering health coverage has declined in the last decade — from 68 percent of all employers in 2001 to 60 percent in 2011 , with most of the decline occurring by 2005 .
most employees participate in employer - sponsored coverage when it is available , in part because employers typically subsidize a large share of employees' premiums , these premium contributions are generally excluded from taxable income , and employees may lack other affordable health coverage options .
you requested that we review existing research on the potential effect of ppaca on the prevalence of employer - sponsored coverage .
employer - sponsored health coverage is the leading source of health coverage in the united states and was provided to more than 156 million americans under age 65 ( about 59 percent ) in 2010 .
nearly all large employers and more than half of small employers offer health coverage to their employees , in part as a means of recruiting and retaining employees .
based on this request , we examined contains a number of provisions that some researchers of 1. estimates of the effect of ppaca on the prevalence of employer - sponsored health coverage , including the number of individuals with employer - sponsored coverage and the proportion of employers that would offer coverage to their employees ; 2. the factors that may contribute to varying estimates ; and 3. how estimates vary by the types of employers and employees that may be affected , as well as other changes employers may be considering to the health benefits they offer .

in particular , to evaluate the studies based on microsimulation models and other analytic approaches , we examined underlying key assumptions that the studies used when modeling employer and employee behavior in making decisions about health coverage , as well as assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant ppaca provisions and how the provisions might be implemented .
