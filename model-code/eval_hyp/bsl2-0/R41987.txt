facebook hosts numerous emergency - related organizations , including information systems for crisis response and management ( iscram ) , and the humanitarian free and open source software ( foss ) project .
in the last 10 years social media has played an increasing role in emergencies and disasters in both the public and private sectors .
rapid changes in communication technologies in the past decade have enabled people to interact and share information through media that were non - existent or widely unavailable as recently as 15 years ago .
other examples of community and household use of the media include warning others of unsafe areas or situations , creating ad hoc volunteer response groups , and raising funds for disaster relief and recovery efforts .
additionally , numerous emergency and disaster - related organizations , including universities , the private and nonprofit sectors , and state and local governments use facebook to disseminate information , communicate with each other , and coordinate activities such as emergency planning and exercises .
some examples of using social media as an emergency management tool include using the medium to conduct emergency communications and issue real time warnings ; using social media to receive requests for assistance ; monitoring user activities and postings to establish situational awareness ; using uploaded images to create damage estimates ; and using social media to conduct investigations and post - incident analysis .
for example , when power or landline service is interrupted , people generally continue to have access to information — at least on a limited basis — through social media platforms with sms and global positioning satellite ( gps ) frameworks , such as twitter .
that percentage is most likely higher today given the rapid proliferation and acceptance of social media in recent years .
thus , certain elements of social media can remain viable during catastrophic events when traditional forms of communication are rendered unusable .
the use of social media for emergencies and disasters can be conceptualized as two broad categories of usage .
the use of social media is an evolving phenomenon .
first , social media can be used as an output to disseminate public safety related information .
there is also evidence that social media is increasingly being used at the community and household level to respond to emergencies and crises .
perhaps one of the greatest benefits of social media is that it allows people to communicate when traditional lines of communication are unavailable .
second , social media can be used as an emergency management tool through the use of inputs .
social media can be accessed by computers , tablets , smart and cellular telephones , and mobile telephone text messaging ( sms ) .
some examples of social media include blogs , discussion forums , chat rooms , wikis , youtube channels , linkedin , instagram , facebook , and twitter .
the term "social media" refers to internet - based applications that enable people to communicate and share resources and information .
a study conducted in 2012 by the american red cross found that 40% of the respondents said they would use social tools to tell others they were safe .
in addition , disaster response efforts — particularly during large scale disasters — have been plagued by communication challenges .
