sec officials attributed this staffing crisis largely to sec's compensation levels , which are lower than those in the private sector and at other federal financial regulators .
specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the factors that influence employee turnover and morale ; ( 2 ) assess the extent of sec's use of human capital policies and practices to recruit , motivate , and retain staff ; and ( 3 ) assess sec's strategic management of its human capital .
according to the former acting sec chairman , sec has been experiencing a staffing crisis that is adversely affecting its ability to protect investors and promote the integrity and efficiency of u.s. securities markets .
however , pay may not be the only factor affecting staff decisions to leave sec ; sec's organizational culture and human capital policies and practices may also have influenced employee retention .
furthermore , 280 available positions remained unfilled in 2001 .
we also reviewed sec's policies , interviewed relevant sec officials in various divisions and offices , and compared sec's practices with those of other federal financial regulators .
as you requested , we focused our study on sec's management of its human capital .
in addition , we met with officials from the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the office of personnel management ( opm ) .
overall , sec's turnover rates for attorneys , accountants , and examiners averaged 15 percent in 2000 , more than twice the rates for comparable positions governmentwide .
of these , more than 500 were attorneys .
over 1,000 employees , or about one - third of the staff , left the u.s securities and exchange commission ( sec ) from 1998 to 2000 .
our survey results can be generalized to all current and former sec staff populations .
we received a total of 1 , 380 responses from current staff , for a response rate of 72 percent , and 336 from former staff , for a response rate of 69 percent .
to determine the factors that influenced turnover , satisfaction , and morale among sec staff , we conducted a survey of current and former sec attorneys , accountants , and examiners .
finally , we reviewed sec's strategic human capital management initiatives and compared them with strategies at other high - performing organizations .
respondents also identified other issues , such as opportunities for advancement , the amount of uncompensated overtime , and the quality of administrative support services , that had or would affect their decision to leave .
certain groups and offices were also more dissatisfied with some aspects of sec than others .
for more information on our scope and methodology , see appendix i .
by an overwhelming majority , the current and former sec attorneys , accountants , and examiners we surveyed cited compensation as their primary reason for leaving sec .
as shown in figure 3 , these factors include opportunities for advancement , uncompensated overtime , quality of administrative support services , quality of communication , and quality of supervision .
although sec has taken steps toward strengthening its strategic human capital management plans , it has not yet devised a method of measuring the success of its initiatives .
