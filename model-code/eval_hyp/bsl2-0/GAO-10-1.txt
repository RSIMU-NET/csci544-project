congress has taken a number of actions to increase oversight of contracts with performance in iraq and afghanistan .
among these , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( ndaa for fy2008 ) directed dod , state , and usaid to sign a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) regarding matters relating to contracting in the two countries , including maintaining common databases of information on contracts and contractor personnel .
reliable and meaningful data on contractors and the services they provide are a starting point for agency decisions on when and how to effectively use contractors ; support contractors in terms of housing , transportation , security , and other services ; and ensure that contractors are properly managed and overseen .
the importance of such information is heightened by the evolving u.s. efforts in the two countries as the agencies reduce their presence in iraq while expanding their presence in afghanistan .
congress directed us to annually review dod , state , and usaid contracts in iraq and afghanistan and report on these reviews through 2010 .
the departments of defense ( dod ) and state and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) have relied extensively on contractors to support troops and civilian personnel and to oversee and carry out reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan .
we and others have reported that the agencies have faced challenges in obtaining information on contracts and contractor personnel to plan and manage efforts in iraq and afghanistan .
in their july 2008 mou , the agencies designated the synchronized predeployment and operational tracker ( spot ) database as their system of record for information on contracts and contractor personnel working in iraq and afghanistan .
absent complete and accurate information on contractors supporting contingency operations , the agencies are limited in their ability to develop a complete picture of their reliance on contractors , the tasks being performed , and their associated costs .
we are providing the results of our analyses of agency - reported data for fiscal year 2008 and the first half of fiscal year 2009 regarding ( 1 ) the agencies' implementation of spot , ( 2 ) the number of contractor personnel , including those performing security functions , working on dod , state , and usaid contracts with performance in iraq and afghanistan , ( 3 ) the number of contractor personnel killed or wounded , and ( 4 ) the number and value of contracts that were active and awarded during our 18-month review period and the extent of competition for new contract awards .
while the use of contractors to support military operations is not new , the extent to which the three agencies are relying on contractors in the two countries is unprecedented â€” both in terms of the number of contractors and the range of services they are providing .
we used the following methodologies to develop our findings: to assess spot's implementation , we reviewed dod , state , and usaid's mou and interviewed officials responsible for implementing spot to determine the agencies' criteria and practices for entering information into spot and the system's current and planned capabilities .
this is our second report issued pursuant to that mandate .
