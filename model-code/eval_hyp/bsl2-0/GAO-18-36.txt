specifically , from fiscal years 2003 through 2016 , improper payments have been estimated to total over $1.2 trillion government - wide .
the most recent government - wide improper payment estimate reported for fiscal year 2016 was $144.3 billion , an increase of approximately $7.6 billion from the $136.7 billion estimate reported for fiscal year 2015 .
ipia defines significant improper payments as gross annual improper payments — the total amount of payments that should not have been made or that were made in an incorrect amount — that may have exceeded ( 1 ) both 1.5 percent of program outlays and $10 million of all program or activity payments made during the fiscal year reported or ( 2 ) $100 million ( regardless of the improper payment percentage of total program outlays ) .
the improper payments information act of 2002 ( ipia ) , as amended by the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 2010 ( ipera ) and the improper payments elimination and recovery improvement act of 2012 ( iperia ) , requires , among other things , that each federal agency review all programs and activities that the agency head administers and identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments — a process commonly referred to as an improper payment risk assessment .
specifically , ipia , as amended , ( hereafter referred to as ipia ) requires agencies to conduct improper payment risk assessments for all federal programs and activities in fiscal year 2011 and at least once every 3 years thereafter .
office of management and budget ( omb ) guidance provides that programs that have been determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments and that are already reporting an estimate — or in the process of establishing an estimate — do not have to perform additional risk assessments .
in addition , certain inspectors general ( ig ) have reported issues with agencies' reported improper payment estimates because agencies used inappropriate sampling methods and inadequate estimation methodologies to calculate and report these estimates .
however , improper payments — payments that should not have been made or were made in incorrect amounts — remain a significant and pervasive government - wide issue .
this report examines the extent to which ( 1 ) the 24 agencies subject to the chief financial officers act of 1990 ( cfo act ) followed omb guidance for reporting on improper payment risk assessments and ( 2 ) selected cfo act agencies designed control activities to include all of their programs and activities in an improper payment risk assessment at least once during a 3-year period , as required by ipia .
specifically , we focused on those 9 agencies that did not report improper payment estimates in fiscal year 2015 , except for those estimates that were mandated to be reported pursuant to the disaster relief appropriations act , 2013 .
to determine if the agencies adhered to omb reporting directives , we analyzed the agency financial reports ( afr ) or the performance and accountability reports ( par ) of the 24 cfo act agencies for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 .
although the control activities are relevant for all of the 24 cfo act agencies , we selected those agencies that have not identified any programs or activities that were susceptible to significant improper payments .
