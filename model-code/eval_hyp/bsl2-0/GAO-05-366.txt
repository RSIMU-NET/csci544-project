§1395ww ( d ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ( 2000 ) .
medicaid services ( cms ) relies on a regulation commonly known as the “75 percent rule,” which was initially issued in 1983 and most recently revised in 2004 .
irf compliance with the requirements of the rule has been problematic , and some irfs have questioned the requirements of the rule .
in this report , we ( 1 ) identify the conditions that irf medicare patients have , the number of these patients considered to have 1 of the 13 conditions , and the number of irfs that meet the requirements of the 75 percent rule ; ( 2 ) describe how irfs assess patients for admission and whether cms reviews admission decisions ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the approach of using a list of conditions in the 75 percent rule to classify irfs .
cms suspended enforcement of the rule in 2002 .
irfs are required to assess patients prior to admission to ensure they require the level of services provided in an irf , and cms is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of individual admissions after the patient has been discharged through reviews for medical necessity conducted under contract by its fiscal intermediaries ( fi ) .
for example , although a subset of patients who have had a stroke may require the intensive level of care provided by an irf , others may be less severely disabled and require less intensive services .
the conference report that accompanied the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 directed us to issue a report , in consultation with experts in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation , to assess whether the current list of conditions represents a clinically appropriate standard for defining irf services and , if not , to determine which additional conditions should be added to the list .
cms issued a final rule — effective july 1 , 2004 — that increased the number of conditions from 10 to 13 , adding , for example , certain hip and knee joint replacements .
irf officials have contended that the list of conditions in the rule should be updated because of changes in medicine that have occurred since the list was established in 1983 and the concomitant expansion of the population that could benefit from inpatient rehabilitation services .
in addition to the 75 percent rule , irfs must meet six other facility criteria to be classified as an irf .
they have noted that their patients are older than the population served in 1983 and are surviving longer with conditions they may not have survived in earlier years .
cms data indicate that in 2002 only 13 percent of irfs had at least 75 percent of patients in 1 of the 10 conditions on the list at that time .
an irf that does not comply with the requirements of the 75 percent rule may lose its classification as an irf and therefore no longer be eligible for payment at a higher rate .
the 2004 rule , which is being implemented over a 3-year transition period , states that if a facility can show that during a 12-month period at least 75 percent of all its patients , including its medicare patients , required intensive rehabilitation services for the treatment of at least 1 of the 13 conditions listed in the rule , it may be classified as an irf .
