in june 2016 , congress enacted the puerto rico oversight , management , and economic stability act to address the debt crisis and puerto rico's fiscal affairs .
the act includes a provision for us to evaluate the application and utilization of sba programs in puerto rico ( including contracting activities relating to hubzone small business concerns ) and identify any provision of federal law that may create an obstacle to efficient implementation of such activities related to these programs .
this report examines ( 1 ) trends in small business contracting and the use of sba programs that provide federal contracting preferences to small businesses in puerto rico from fiscal years 2006 through 2016 , and ( 2 ) stakeholder views on any challenges small businesses in puerto rico face in obtaining federal contracting opportunities , including those posed by federal laws , and steps sba and other agencies have taken to assist puerto rican small businesses in obtaining federal contracting opportunities .
puerto rico currently faces many economic challenges .
the small business administration ( sba ) administers several programs in puerto rico and nationwide that provide federal contracting preferences to small businesses , including the 8 ( a ) business development ( 8 ( a ) ) , historically underutilized business zone ( hubzone ) , women - owned small business ( wosb ) , and service - disabled veteran - owned small business ( sdvosb ) programs .
small businesses certified with these socioeconomic designations benefit from federal contracting preferences , such as sole source contracts ( awards are made without competition ) and set - aside contracts ( awards are limited to a designated pool of competing firms ) .
the federal government has additionally specified annual prime contracting and subcontracting goals for designated small business categories .
additionally , as of june 2017 , puerto rico's government faces a debt crisis .
total federal contracting obligations in puerto rico have ranged from a low of $404 million to a high of $1 billion during the past 10 fiscal years .
to identify trends in the use of sba programs that provide federal contracting preferences to small businesses in puerto rico from fiscal years 2006 through 2016 , we analyzed data on prime contract obligation amounts for puerto rico and nationwide from the federal procurement data system â€“ next generation ( fpds - ng ) for those fiscal years .
to identify stakeholder views on any challenges that small businesses in puerto rico face in obtaining federal contracting opportunities , including those posed by federal laws , and steps sba and other agencies have taken to assist puerto rican small businesses in obtaining federal contracting opportunities , we interviewed sba officials and other stakeholders such as federal agency contracting officials , industry associations , and economic development entities in puerto rico .
according to the u.s. census bureau , over 99 percent ( about 44,000 ) of the businesses in puerto rico are small .
u.s. census bureau's puerto rico community survey and american community survey from 2015 show that about 46 percent of puerto rico's residents live below the federal poverty level , compared to a national average of about 15 percent .
we did not assess the extent to which steps sba and other agencies have taken address the challenges stakeholders identified .
