the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for 1999 established stewardship contracting authority to achieve national forest land management goals that meet local and rural community needs .
because of your interest in the status of the forest service's and blm's implementation of stewardship contracting authority , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the status of stewardship contracting projects and the land management goals they address ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the agencies have contracting and financial controls in place that ensure accountability in managing stewardship contracting projects ; ( 3 ) the steps the agencies have taken to involve communities in designing , implementing , and evaluating stewardship contracting projects ; and ( 4 ) each agency's plans for future stewardship contracting activities .
both the forest service in the department of agriculture ( usda ) and the bureau of land management ( blm ) in the department of the interior are placing greater emphasis on thinning forests and rangelands to help reduce the buildup of potentially hazardous fuels , partly in response to the healthy forests restoration act of 2003 .
among other things , the act directs the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to give priority to hazardous fuel reduction projects that provide for the protection of at - risk communities or watersheds , or that implement community wildfire protection plans .
prominent among the stewardship contracting authorities is the ability to ( 1 ) trade goods — timber , for example — for contract services , such as thinning of small trees and brush ; and ( 2 ) retain for use in future stewardship projects any receipts generated through selling forest products such as timber , rather than returning the receipts to the department of the treasury , which is required under traditional timber sales .
although stewardship contracting was initially established as a demonstration project that involved a limited number of individual projects within the forest service and was to end in 2002 , the consolidated appropriations resolution of 2003 , among other things , extended the use of stewardship contracting authority to 2013 , eliminated the limit on the number of projects , authorized commercial tree removal for forest health purposes as a project purpose , and extended the authority to blm .
recent severe wildfire seasons have focused attention on the state of our nation's forests .
the forest service and blm , which together manage a total of about 450 million acres of federal land , are focusing on a new tool they consider essential to their efforts to reduce fuels: stewardship contracting .
many of these forests have become dense with small , tightly spaced trees and thick brush , which — combined with drought , wind , and other adverse weather conditions — have fueled extensive wildland fires in recent years .
the law stated that the land management goals of stewardship contracts include road and trail maintenance , watershed restoration , and prescribed burning and noncommercial tree removal to improve forest health .
stewardship contracting involves the use of any of several contracting authorities that were first authorized for use by the forest service on a pilot basis in october 1998 .
in addition , you asked us to determine the forest service's response to concerns raised by environmental groups about six specific stewardship contracting projects ; the results of this work are contained in appendix i .
