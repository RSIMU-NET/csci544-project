cms depends on more than 200 information technology ( it ) systems to support administration of the medicare program , including determination of eligibility for benefits , processing and payment of claims , and exchange of medicare - related data with external stakeholders .
our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) assess the actions cms has been taking to identify and implement it solutions for removing ssns from medicare beneficiaries' cards , and ( 2 ) determine whether cms's ongoing it modernization initiatives could offer opportunities to facilitate efforts to remove the ssn from the cards .
in making these comparisons , we identified common characteristics and efforts that could be coordinated to achieve efficiencies in implementing system changes .
to address the second objective , we identified criteria by examining federal laws and guidance for leveraging it modernization initiatives to guide systems development , and assessed plans and briefings describing cms's initiatives to modernize its it environment .
many of these systems were developed decades ago and are difficult to modify or update to incorporate changes in business rules or data , or to integrate with other systems .
the approximately 50 million cards that have been issued and are currently in use display social security numbers ( ssn ) as a component of beneficiaries' claims identification numbers .
in 2010 the agency assessed its it environment in response to direction from the patient protection and affordable care actmodernization initiative .
cms's contractors that process fee - for - service claims are referred to a medicare administration contractors .
we compared activities identified in these documents to department - level requirements for identifying , developing , and implementing technical solutions for business processes .
to further address the objective , we examined data collected by cms from the federal stakeholders with whom it exchanges data related to medicare beneficiaries â€” the social security administration ( ssa ) and the railroad retirement board .
to determine the extent to which the goals and objectives of these initiatives could be leveraged to facilitate the ssn removal effort , we compared descriptions of specific modernization projects to information obtained from agency technical documents describing the systems that would have to be modified if the ssn were to be removed from cards .
and began to take steps toward planning an agencywide it at your request , we conducted a study of cms's efforts related to the removal of ssns from medicare cards .
as one of the federal government's largest programs , medicare provides health insurance to the nation's elderly , certain disabled individuals , and individuals with end - stage renal disease .
the program , which served approximately 50 million beneficiaries in 2012 , consists of four parts: a , b , c , and d. parts a and b are referred to as fee - for - service programs , and respectively , provide health insurance coverage for ( 1 ) hospital and inpatient stays , hospice , and home health services ; and ( 2 ) hospital outpatient , physician , and other services such as home health care , and durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs and walkers .
however , the visual display of the ssn introduces risks to the security of beneficiaries' personal information , as the number may , among other things , be obtained and used by criminals to conduct identity theft .
