the six phthalates are di - ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) , dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) , benzyl butyl phthalate ( bbp ) , diisononyl phthalate ( dinp ) , diisodecyl phthalate ( didp ) , and di - n - octyl phthalate ( dnop ) .
some ( but not all ) of these phthalates are known to cause reproductive damage in rodents .
newly enacted p.l .
110 - 314 , the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) , prohibits the sale of children's toys and child care articles that contain more than 0.1% of dehp , dbp , or bbp .
recent interest by governmental bodies , including congress , in the potential adverse human health effects that might be related to phthalate exposure has focused on six phthalates that are produced and used in very large quantities .
the most common use of phthalates is to increase the flexibility of polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) and polyvinylidene chloride ( pvdc ) polymers .
a similar ban applies for dinp , didp , and dnop , until the consumer product safety commission issues a rule either establishing or eliminating the ban on a permanent basis .
phthalates are released from those products over time , and are dispersed to the air , water , soil , and living things .
"phthalates" refers to a group of chemical compounds that are heavily produced and widely used to make the plastics found in thousands of consumer products .
second , would the provision reduce the risks without generating greater risks ? .
there were two issues of particular concern during development of the final phthalate provisions of the cspia .
first , what is the scientific basis for health concerns about exposure to these chemicals ? .
the scientific basis for concerns about risks to human health appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates , adequate with respect to others , and weak for the remaining chemicals .
at that time , regulators focused on carcinogenic effects , rather than effects on fetal development .
the strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000 .
these issues are discussed briefly here , based on the scientific and legal information presented above .
the effect of banning use of the other phthalates is less clear , because their child - related uses are not known .
by restricting the use of six phthalates in child - care items and toys , the new law codifies the voluntary agreements reached by cpsc with product manufacturers ( to keep dehp and dinp out of nipples , pacifiers , and teething toys , and dehp out of toys that might be mouthed ) and should reduce exposure to dinp , the only phthalate currently used in the united states to produce toys .
the structure - activity relationship ( between the molecular structure of the phthalates and developmental damage ) is well understood , such that scientific concern focuses now on dehp , dbp , and dbb .
dinp also is a developmental toxicant , but is only about 15% as potent as the most potent phthalates .
this more recent animal evidence strongly supports a claim that dehp , dbp , and dbb can harm reproduction and damage fetal and juvenile development in rats .
