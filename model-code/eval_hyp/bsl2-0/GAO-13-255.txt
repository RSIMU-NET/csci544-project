further , meeting this demand from existing agricultural resources will require substantial increases in global and u.s. agricultural productivity — productivity based on long - term investments in public agricultural research .
advances resulting from basic and applied agricultural sciences , such as disease - resistant crop varieties and efficient irrigation practices , are fundamental to boosting agricultural yields , increasing farm - sector profitability , and improving nutrition and human health .
according to a u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) report , by 2050 , global agricultural demand is projected to increase by 70 to 100 percent because of population growth , energy demands , and higher incomes in developing countries .
the nation's increasingly tight budget environment underscores the need for federal research agencies to set priorities carefully and make effective use of limited research funding .
as agency budgets continue to tighten , pressure increases on program leaders to ensure that dollars go to the highest - priority activities and that research projects are complementary , rather than unnecessarily duplicative .
usda's principal internal ( intramural ) and external ( extramural ) research agencies — the agricultural research service ( ars ) and the national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) , respectively — have long played a critical role in supporting agricultural science , including in areas such as plant and animal sciences and human nutrition .
in addition , usda economists estimated in 2007 that each dollar spent on public agricultural research returned an estimated $10 in benefits to the economy , and university researchers have estimated even greater returns .
unlike ars , nifa does not do its own research but supports research through grants ( to individuals , institutions , and organizations ) , education to improve scientific and agricultural literacy , and its extension network to solve public agricultural problems .
at both ars and nifa , national program leaders are responsible for setting the agencies' research priorities ; obtaining input from stakeholders in industry , academia , and elsewhere ; and identifying gaps in agricultural research .
by itself or with other partner organizations , nifa offers competitive and noncompetitive grants to land - grant colleges and universities in all 50 states and to other universities as well .
according to the academies , even though some duplicative research may be acceptable — for example , during periods of great crisis , such as the federal response to aids ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) , in which usually stringent research practices were eased somewhat in the pursuit of as many promising leads as possible — eliminating unnecessarily duplicative research is a means of saving public dollars and thus minimizing waste .
ars is usda's primary intramural research agency , typically working on more than 800 research projects within 18 national program areas in more than 90 ars locations .
this report examines ( 1 ) the topics ars and nifa focus on and the safeguards they use to prevent duplication of research projects , along with any shortcomings in those safeguards , and ( 2 ) collaborative planning ars and nifa engaged in and how , if at all , such planning could be enhanced .
as the 21st century unfolds , agriculture and natural resources stand at the crossroads of some of the world's most critical problems , such as establishing sustainable food production , providing clean and abundant water , and ensuring food safety .
