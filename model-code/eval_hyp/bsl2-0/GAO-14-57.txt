in addition , we reported on the number of american indians and alaska natives who may gain new health care coverage beginning in 2014 as a result of provisions in the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) of 2010 .
1. the length of time it takes external providers to receive payment from ihs after delivering chs services ; 2. the performance measures that ihs has established for the amount of time it takes to process chs provider payments ; 3. the factors that affect the length of time it takes ihs to pay chs 4. how new health care coverage options included in ppaca could affect the chs program .
to determine the length of time after service delivery that payments are made , we obtained ihs data on paid chs claims for health care services delivered in fiscal year 2011 that were authorized by ihs - operated chs programs in 10 areas and that were paid as of february 2013 ; a total of approximately 398,000 claims .
when services are not available at these facilities , the facilities may use ihs's contract health services ( chs ) program funds to obtain care for eligible patients from external health care providers , including hospitals and office - based physicians .
claims data from fiscal year 2011 were the most recent sufficiently complete data available for our analysis .
we identified challenges cited by providers with the chs program payment process .
ihs has oversight authority over local chs programs that are affiliated with ihs - operated facilities.from external providers based on requirements that are unique to chs .
these facilities vary in the services they are able to provide ; for example , some facilities offer comprehensive hospital services , while others offer only primary care services .
the indian health service ( ihs ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is charged with providing health care services to the approximately 2.1 million american indians and alaska natives who are members or descendants of federally recognized tribes .
we found , for example , that according to providers , sometimes it took months or years to receive payment after providing a service , which added to the burden of both patients and providers .
we assessed the reliability of ihs's federal chs program claims data by reviewing documentation and discussing the data with knowledgeable officials .
