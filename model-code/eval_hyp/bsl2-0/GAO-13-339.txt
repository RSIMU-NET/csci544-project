corporate tax expenditures cover a wide range of federal policy goals and may have one or more purposes that are also pursued by federal spending programs .
specifically , this report: ( 1 ) describes trends in the number of corporate tax expenditures and aggregate corporate revenue losses since 1986 ; ( 2 ) describes the use of corporate tax expenditures in 2011 ; and ( 3 ) compares the size of corporate tax expenditures to federal spending by budget function and , for tax expenditures used only by corporations , identifies spending programs with similar purposes .
discussion regarding corporate tax reform has involved modifying or repealing certain tax expenditures as a way to broaden the corporate tax base and using the resulting revenue gains to offset reduced revenue from lowering the corporate income tax rate .
tax expenditures play a central role in a number of congress's and the administration's proposals for corporate tax reform .
however , there is little agreement on how much corporate tax rates should be reduced ; which tax expenditures should be repealed or modified to offset such a rate cut ; and what , if any , changes would be made to the individual income tax system to account for other types of business organizations and individual taxpayers that claim the same tax expenditures as corporations .
we defined corporate tax expenditures as those that treasury reported had estimated revenue losses for corporations in 2011 ; we describe any tax expenditures that treasury estimated lost only corporate tax revenue in 2011 as corporate - only tax expenditures .
as we recently reported , reassessments of tax expenditures benefit from understanding whether there are related spending programs .
we aggregated estimated corporate and individual revenue losses and also identified the number of tax expenditures with only estimated corporate revenue losses , those with both corporate and individual revenue losses , and those with only individual revenue losses .
to identify how corporate tax expenditures have changed in terms of their numbers and aggregate revenue loss , we analyzed department of the treasury ( treasury ) estimates for fiscal years 1986 through 2011 .
estimated corporate revenue losses represent the amount of revenue the federal government forgoes as a result of corporate tax expenditures .
to compare corporate tax expenditures to federal spending by budget function , we summed the estimated revenue losses of corporate tax expenditures and compared them to federal outlays by budget function for 2011 .
to describe the use of corporate tax expenditures , including the number of taxpayers claiming corporate - only tax expenditures , we analyzed treasury revenue loss estimates for 2011 for corporate and individual taxpayer groups .
these tax expenditures also have broader purposes such as promoting domestic energy production and energy security .
to identify spending programs with reported purposes similar to corporate - only tax expenditures in 2011 , we first identified the reported purpose of those tax expenditures by reviewing their legislative histories , our prior work , as well as work by the congressional research service ( crs ) and the congressional budget office ( cbo ) that discussed the tax expenditures .
applying an even broader national purpose , such as encouraging domestic energy production , could further increase the number of federal spending programs , as well as other federal activities , such as federal regulations and tax expenditures , which may share a similar purpose .
