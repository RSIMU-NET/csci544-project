most advanced economies are implementing fiscal austerity programs to lower their debt levels .
however , concerns over rising debt levels are not limited to eurozone countries .
third , how other countries reduce their debt impacts the u.s. economy .
first , the imf has identified advanced economy debt as a possible threat to the global economic recovery , as countries struggle to find a balance between growth and debt management in an uncertain global economic recovery .
second , congress has and continues to debate a number of fiscal issues , particularly in the context of federal budget and the debt ceiling .
concerns about high levels of public debt have been most focused on the eurozone , where a debt crisis has been ongoing since late 2009 .
there are also concerns about the sustainability of their public finances in spain and italy , much larger economies in the eurozone .
it also discusses the current strategy being used by most advanced economies — fiscal austerity — and concerns that have been raised about its global impact .
high levels of sovereign debt in advanced economies are of interest to congress for a number of reasons .
simultaneous austerity programs in the advanced countries , the united states' major trading partners , could depress demand for u.s. exports abroad , as well as deter investment in and from advanced economies .
these factors led to large budget deficits and increased borrowing by governments from capital markets in order to fund these deficits .
four eurozone countries — greece , ireland , portugal , and cyprus — have had to borrow money from other european countries and the international monetary fund ( imf ) in order to meet obligations and avoid defaulting on their debt .
debates about the public debt are central features of political discourse in the united states , japan , and the united kingdom , among others .
finally , the fourth section analyzes issues of particular interest to congress , including comparisons between u.s. and european debt levels , how efforts to reduce debt levels could impact the u.s. economy , and policy options available to congress for engaging on this issue .
analyzing debt levels and factors that shape debt sustainability can help inform these comparisons .
figure 1 shows the rapid increase in public debt as a percentage of gdp in the major g - 7 economies ( canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united kingdom , and the united states ) following the financial crisis .
in many of these fiscal debates , parallels are drawn between the united states and other advanced economies , such as greece , ireland , and the united kingdom .
in many advanced economies , the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and ensuing recession resulted in large fiscal stimulus packages , the nationalization of private - sector debt , lower tax revenue , and higher government spending .
for the g - 7 economies , sovereign debt rose from 84% of gdp in 2006 to a forecasted 121% of gdp in 2013 .
the second section examines the shift of concerns over sovereign debt sustainability from emerging markets in the 1990s and 2000s to advanced economies following the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 , and the challenges posed by high debt levels .
