addressing the damage from the hurricane cost the federal government more than $16 billion in disaster relief , according to data from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) .
in june 2014 , the water resources reform and development act of 2014 was enacted and included provisions to , among other things , increase the capacity of nonfederal stakeholders to promote levee safety .
further , the committee discussed the potential for federal levee - related programs to be aligned to provide incentives , such as financial or technical assistance , to nonfederal stakeholders to promote more shared responsibility for levee safety .
more specifically , the committee stated that all federal programs that significantly impact governmental and individual decision making in leveed areas must be aligned toward ( 1 ) the goal of reliable levees , ( 2 ) an informed and involved public , ( 3 ) shared responsibility for the protection of human life , and ( 4 ) mitigation of public and private economic damages .
the act requires the corps and fema to take the lead on certain national levee - safety - related activities , including establishing voluntary national levee - safety guidelines and providing financial and technical incentives to nonfederal stakeholders to take various actions to promote levee safety .
the program provided insurance to help protect over 5.1 million policyholders against flood losses in 2015 .
in 2009 , the committee recommended , among other things , that federal levee - related programs be aligned to promote levee safety nationwide .
in 2007 , congress established the national committee on levee safety to develop recommendations for a national levee safety program .
to examine the progress that the corp and fema have made in carrying out key national levee - safety - related activities under the water resources reform and development act of 2014 , we reviewed pertinent federal laws and executive orders , including the water resources reform and development act of 2014 ; the water resources development act of 2007 ; the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ; executive order 11988 , floodplain management ; and executive order 13690 , establishing a federal flood risk management standard and a process for further soliciting and considering stakeholder input .
without a plan , including milestones for accomplishing the activities using existing resources or requesting additional resources as needed , the agencies are unlikely to make further progress implementing the activities under the act .
in its report , the committee stated that the average age of levees within federal levee - safety programs was approximately 50 years but that many nonfederal levees could be much older â€” 100 years old or more .
this report examines the corps' and fema's progress in carrying out key national activities related to levee safety under the water resources reform and development act of 2014 .
the committee comprised 23 members , including both federal and nonfederal stakeholders .
we reviewed corps and fema budget , planning , and policy documents concerning the agencies' levee - related programs , as well as documentation about interagency efforts in which they participate .
in keeping with this goal , the committee called on the corps , with assistance from fema , to develop voluntary national levee - safety guidelines to help ensure best engineering practices for levees are implemented throughout the nation at all levels of government .
