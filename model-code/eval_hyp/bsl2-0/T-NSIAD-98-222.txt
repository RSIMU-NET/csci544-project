i will discuss ( 1 ) key elements in the export control systems of the departments of commerce and state , ( 2 ) how export controls for commercial satellites have evolved over the years , ( 3 ) the concerns and issues debated over the transfer of commercial communications satellites to the export licensing jurisdiction of the department of commerce , and ( 4 ) the safeguards that may be applied to commercial satellite exports .
the allegation that a major u.s. satellite manufacturer provided china with sensitive technologies that may have applicability to its missile programs has highlighted how the united states controls the export of such technology and how this policy has changed in recent years .
my testimony today is based on our january 1997 report , prepared at the request of the chairman , house national security committee , on the military sensitivity of commercial communications satellites and the implications of the 1996 change in export licensing jurisdiction .
lastly , i will share some observations on the current export control system .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the evolution of export controls on commercial communications satellites .
the u.s. export control system for items with military applications is divided into two regimes .
state licenses munitions items , which are designed , developed , configured , adapted , or modified for military applications , and commerce licenses most dual - use items , which are items that have both commercial and military applications .
although the commerce licensing system is the primary vehicle to control dual - use items , some dual - use items — those of such military sensitivity that stronger control is merited — are controlled under the state system .
in october and november 1996 , commerce and state published regulations implementing this change , with commerce defining enhanced export controls to apply when licensing these two items .
commercial communications satellites are intended to facilitate civil communication functions through various media , such as voice , data , and video , but they often carry military data as well .
in contrast , military communications satellites are used exclusively to transfer information related to national security and have one or more of nine characteristics that allow the satellites to be used for such purposes as providing real - time battlefield data and relaying intelligence data for specific military needs .
in addition , the technologies used to integrate a satellite to its launch vehicle are similar to those used to integrate ballistic missiles to their launch vehicles .
for example , under the 1993 missile technology sanctions , sanctions were not imposed on satellites that included missile - related components .
commercial communications satellites are subject to two important types of sanctions: ( 1 ) missile technology control regime and ( 2 ) tiananmen square sanctions .
exports under state's system that exceed certain dollar thresholds ( including all satellites ) require notification to the congress .
in march 1996 , the executive branch announced a change in licensing jurisdiction transferring two items — commercial jet engine hot section technologies and commercial communications satellites — from state to commerce .
defense's power to influence the decision - making process has diminished since the transfer .
