our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the status of renewable energy permitting on federal land , including time frames for processing permits applied for since epact 2005 ; ( 2 ) actions the agencies have taken to facilitate renewable energy development on federal land , particularly since the passage of epact 2005 ; and ( 3 ) factors affecting renewable energy development on federal land .
although renewable energy is generally cleaner to produce than energy from conventional sources , such as coal - or gas - fired power plants , renewable energy projects can have significant environmental impacts .
concerns over reliance on imported oil and greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels to generate power have increased interest in producing electricity from renewable sources , including wind , solar , and geothermal energy .
because areas of federal land have a high potential for producing renewable energy , interest has increased in permitting such production on those lands over the past decade .
in the coming decades , the energy information administration in the department of energy projects the strongest growth in the domestic energy sector will come from renewable energy .
for example , the department of the interior's bureau of land management ( blm ) manages approximately 248 million surface acres , or about one - eighth of all lands in the united states , and estimates that 20.6 million acres have commercial wind energy generation potential and more than 20 million acres have commercial solar energy generation potential .
the federal government is uniquely positioned to affect the development of renewable energy sources , in part through its land management activities .
in light of interest in renewable energy development on federal land , you asked us to review federal agencies' processes and time frames for permitting renewable energy projects .
for example , through the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ) , congress directed the secretary of the interior to “seek to have approved non - hydropower renewable energy projects located on public lands with a generation capacity of at least 10,000 megawatts of electricity” by 2015 .
accordingly , part of the federal permitting process for renewable energy development on blm - and forest service - managed lands involves not only those agencies but also the fish and wildlife service and national park service in assessing potential environmental effects .
developing renewable energy projects on a scale large enough to generate substantial electric power ( i.e. , on a utility scale ) can affect the environment across hundreds , even thousands , of acres of federal land and , depending on the energy source , may preclude uses of those acres for other purposes .
in 2009 the secretary issued an order establishing renewable energy as a priority for the department and also establishing a task force to , among other tasks , develop a strategy to increase the development and transmission of renewable energy from appropriate areas on public lands .
to determine the status of renewable energy permitting , we administered a questionnaire to blm officials nationwide , covering all permit applications for onshore wind , solar , and geothermal energy projects submitted to blm — the agency responsible for permitting almost all applications submitted for renewable energy development on federal lands — from enactment of epact 2005 ( august 8 , 2005 ) through may 2012 .
