the demand for usace projects typically exceeds the federal appropriations for these projects .
congress directs and oversees the specific navigation , flood control , and ecosystem restoration projects that usace plans and constructs through authorization legislation , annual and supplemental appropriations legislation , and oversight efforts .
unlike with federal funding for highways and municipal water infrastructure , the majority of federal funds provided to usace for water resource projects are not distributed by formula to states or through competitive grant programs .
broadly , congress is faced with considering how well the nation is addressing its water resource needs and what is the current and future role of usace in addressing those needs .
more recently , congress has authorized the agency to restore aquatic ecosystems .
usace operates more than 700 dams ; has built 14,500 miles of levees ; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal , great lakes , and inland harbors , as well as 12,000 miles of inland waterways .
instead , usace is directly engaged in the planning and construction of projects ; the majority of its appropriations are used performing work on specific studies and contracting for construction of projects authorized by congress .
the agency typically is working with nonfederal project sponsors in the development of these water resource projects .
part of the issue is how effective , efficient , and equitable is the usace project delivery process in meeting the nation's needs .
congress then charged the agency to help in reducing the damages from floods .
it began with improving and regulating navigation channels thereby facilitating the movement of goods between states and for import and export .
the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) is an agency within the department of defense with both military and civil works responsibilities .
the agency's civil works mission has evolved with the changing needs of the nation .
wrrda 2014 expanded authorizations and authorization of appropriations for specific multi - state environmental infrastructure activities .
although no administration has included environmental infrastructure in a usace budget request since the first congressional authorization in 1992 , congress regularly includes usace environmental infrastructure funds in appropriations bills .
recently , funds have been used to continue ongoing environmental infrastructure assistance .
the agency's authorities to undertake small projects are called continuing authorities programs ( caps ) .
since 1992 , congress has authorized usace to contribute assistance to more than 300 of these projects and to state and regional programs , with authorizations of appropriations totaling more than $5 billion .
usace environmental infrastructure assistance activities , however , are subject to federal laws , such as nepa .
these funds are part of the "additional funding" provided by congress in enacted appropriations bills .
in wrda 2016 and wrda 2018 , congress expanded the section 7001 process , allowing nonfederal entities to propose modifications to existing authorities for environmental infrastructure assistance .
congress also has specifically authorized usace to undertake numerous municipal water and wastewater projects .
after enactment of an appropriations bill , the administration follows guidance provided in the bill and accompanying reports to direct its use of these funds on authorized environmental infrastructure assistance activities .
congress also has authorized usace to provide technical and construction assistance to tribes .
