for this report , we evaluated ( 1 ) how state assesses risks to u.s. diplomatic residences overseas ; ( 2 ) the timeliness , clarity , and consistency of state's security standards for these residences ; ( 3 ) how state addresses security vulnerabilities at residences ; and ( 4 ) how state manages risks to other soft targets overseas .
state has constructed more than 100 new diplomatic facilities since 1998 and has enhanced security measures at many others .
to address these objectives , we reviewed u.s. laws ; relevant state security policies and procedures as found in cables , the foreign affairs manual ( fam ) , and the foreign affairs handbooks ( fah ) — in particular , the residential security handbook and overseas security policy board ( ospb ) standards ; bureau of diplomatic security ( ds ) threat and risk ratings , periodic assessments of post security programs , and residential security exceptions ; post - specific documents pertaining to security of residences and other soft targets ; bureau of overseas buildings operations ( obo ) data on overseas residences and grants for security upgrades at schools attended by children of u.s. government personnel and off - compound employee association facilities ; classified accountability review board ( arb ) reports containing recommendations related to residences ; and past gao , state office of inspector general , and congressional research service reports .
recent events have heightened awareness of the threats these kinds of facilities face .
increased security at these highly symbolic targets has raised concerns that residences , schools , and other places where u.s. diplomatic personnel and their families congregate may be viewed as more attractive “soft targets.” according to state reporting , there were approximately 30 attacks against u.s. diplomatic residences and other soft targets overseas from august 1998 to december 2014 .
you asked us to review the security of u.s. diplomatic residences and other soft targets overseas , particularly in high - threat areas .
furthermore , terrorists have conducted attacks on turkish diplomatic residences in somalia and numerous schools in nigeria , pakistan , and kenya .
following the august 1998 bombings of two u.s. embassies in east africa , the department of state ( state ) embarked on a multiyear , multibillion dollar effort to replace and secure vulnerable diplomatic facilities overseas .
we also interviewed officials in washington , d.c. , from ds ; obo ; state's office of management policy , rightsizing , and innovation ; and the u.s. agency for international development .
we reviewed and compared relevant residential security standards and other security - related guidance within the fam and fah to evaluate their clarity and consistency .
we also evaluated the timeliness of updates to residential security standards .
we also reviewed security measures in place at 10 schools attended by u.s. government dependents and 3 off - compound employee association facilities and met with state's regional security officers ( rso ) and other officials involved in efforts to secure residences and other soft targets .
for example , a 2014 posting on a jihadist website called for attacks on american and other international schools in the middle east .
we traveled to 7 overseas diplomatic posts and also conducted work focused on 3 other posts .
