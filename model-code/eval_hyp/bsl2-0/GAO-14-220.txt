the current federal budget situation poses additional challenges for agencies .
all of these conditions will require greater scrutiny of federal efforts .
the budget control act of 2011 , signed on august 2 , 2011 , established a 10-year cap on discretionary spending as part of a process to achieve more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction .
federal agencies will need to work even more closely with other agencies to leverage more limited resources to achieve their missions in the current fiscally constrained environment .
spending for the major health and retirement programs is projected to increase as a share of the gross domestic product in coming decades , putting greater pressure on the rest of the federal budget .
for almost two decades we have reported on agencies' missed opportunities for improved collaboration through the effective implementation of the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) .
the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) establishes a new framework aimed at taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing on results and improving government performance .
the objectives of this report are to examine how select interagency groups ( such as task forces , working groups , councils , and committees ) : 1 ) defined their outcomes ; 2 ) measured performance and ensured accountability ; 3 ) established leadership approaches ; and 4 ) used resources , such as funding , staff and technology .
second , collaboration and improved working relationships across agencies are fundamental to many of the issues that we have designated as high risk due to their vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement , or because they are most in need of transformation .
in our 1997 assessment of the status of the implementation of gpra , we reported that agencies faced challenges addressing crosscutting issues , which led to fragmentation and overlap .
like the original gpra , effective implementation of gprama could play an important role in clarifying desired outcomes , in addressing program performance that spans multiple organizations , and in facilitating future actions to reduce unnecessary duplication , overlap , and fragmentation .
first , our reports over the past three years identified more than 80 areas where opportunities exist for executive branch agencies or congress to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication .
however , several key governance challenges remained , including addressing crosscutting issues .
now , more than 20 years since gpra's passage , our work continues to demonstrate that the needed collaboration is not sufficiently widespread .
we found that resolving many of these issues requires better collaboration among agencies .
interagency groups ( such as task forces , working groups , councils and committees ) ; co - location ( such as housing one or more federal agencies that collaborate on various programs in one location ) ; and collaboration technologies ( such as shared databases and web portals ) , among others .
again , we reported in 2004 — more than 10 years after the enactment of gpra — that there was an inadequate focus on addressing issues that cut across federal agencies .
to help address this and other challenges , gprama revises existing provisions and adds new requirements .
