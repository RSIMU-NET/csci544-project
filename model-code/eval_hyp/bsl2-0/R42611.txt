some argue the pipeline would have national energy and climate change policy implications .
some raise concerns about potential local impacts , such as oil spills .
for these stakeholders , the presidential permit decision has been seen as a gauge of the administration's support for reducing domestic fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions .
thus , the pipeline proposal has provided a vehicle to galvanize advocates interested in climate change mitigation , particularly the reduction or replacement of fossil fuel use .
proponents of the keystone xl pipeline , including high - level canadian officials and u.s. and canadian petroleum industry stakeholders , base their arguments supporting the pipeline primarily on increasing the security and diversity of the u.s. petroleum supply and economic benefits , especially jobs .
arguments supporting the pipeline's construction also cover a range of issues .
some highlight the oil extraction impacts in canada .
policy makers continue to debate various issues associated with the proposed pipeline .
although some groups have raised concerns over previous oil pipelines — alberta clipper and the keystone mainline pipelines , both of which are operating — the keystone xl proposal has generated substantially more interest among environmental stakeholders .
for more discussion of these and other issues , see crs report r41668 , keystone xl pipeline project: key issues , by [author name scrubbed] et al .
section three discusses selected environmental issues , including greenhouse gas emissions intensity , related climate change concerns , pipeline oil spill risks , and two oil sands extraction concerns: land disturbance and water resources .
the decision of whether to issue this permit has provided ( and continues to provide ) a rallying point for environmental groups who have voiced various concerns over the construction of the pipeline and / or further development of the oil sands .
as such , the environmental issues discussed in this report do not represent an exhaustive list of concerns and issues .
if constructed , the pipeline would transport crude oil ( e.g. , synthetic crude oil or diluted bitumen ) derived from oil sands resources in alberta , canada , to refineries and other destinations in the united states .
moreover , many of the environmental concerns are not unique to oil sands .
this report focuses on selected environmental concerns raised in conjunction with the proposed pipeline and the oil sands crude it will transport .
an analysis of these issues is beyond the scope of this report .
stakeholders who raise concerns with the pipeline project are not a monolithic group .
the proposed keystone xl pipeline has received considerable attention in recent months .
one could compose analogous lists for all forms of energy: coal , natural gas , nuclear , biofuels , conventional crude oil .
therefore , the oil sands / pipeline issues discussed in this report , when practicable , will be compared to other energy sources , particularly conventional crude oil development .
such a decision requires the identification of factors that would inform that determination , as well as an assessment of the resulting impacts of both building and not building the pipeline .
the presidential permit application — submitted by transcanada — for the pipeline's construction represents a singular decision made by the administration about whether or not the pipeline would serve the national interest .
