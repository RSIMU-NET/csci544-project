this situation , they say , has hindered reform implementation and the fight against corruption .
bulgaria held its most recent parliamentary elections on june 25 , 2005 .
three center - right groups won the remaining seats: the union of democratic forces ( 20 ) ; democrats for a strong bulgaria ( 17 ) ; and the bulgarian national union coalition ( 13 ) .
nevertheless , analysts were concerned about the group's electoral success , which shows significant public dissatisfaction with bulgaria's political class .
all parties pledged to exclude ataka from the government .
the national movement for stability and progress ( nmsp ) , a centrist group , finished second with 63 seats .
experts note that it has been a common phenomenon in central and eastern europe that when a former communist party ( such as the bsp ) moves to the center , often as part of european integration efforts , its place in the political spectrum is often taken over by populist and nationalist groups .
the movement for rights and freedoms ( mrf ) , representing the country's ethnic turkish minority , won 34 seats .
the winner of the vote was a coalition led by the left - of - center bulgarian socialist party ( bsp ) , which received 82 seats in the 240-seat national assembly , bulgaria's unicameral parliament .
a new party , citizens for the european development of bulgaria ( cedb ) , is not currently represented in parliament , but could win a large number of seats in new elections .
despite the defection of some nmsp deputies to the opposition in 2007 , the government retains a majority and appears determined to stay in power until 2009 , when new elections must be held .
the stalemate was finally resolved on august 15 , when the parliament approved a new coalition government .
 ) , a group that mixes far - right xenophobia with leftist economic populism , won a surprising 21 seats .
nevertheless , turnout was only 55% , the lowest since the end of communism .
the cedb , led by sofia mayor boiko borisov , espouses pro - eu and pro - law - and - order policies .
in an effort to boost turnout , the government introduced a lottery in which voters could win televisions , cars , and other prizes .
critics claim that stanishev is a relatively weak leader and that real power rests in the hands of party barons , particularly in the bsp and mrf .
the process of forming a new government proved difficult , in part because of the scattered distribution of the vote and personal animosity among party leaders , including within the center - right portion of the political spectrum .
bulgaria is a parliamentary democracy that has held generally free and fair elections since the overthrow of the communist regime in 1989 .
it is composed of the bsp , mrf , and nmsp , with bsp leader sergei stanishev as prime minister .
although purvanov is one of bulgaria's most popular political figures , most political power is held by the prime minister and government ; the bulgarian presidency is relatively weak .
ataka ( attack ! .
