this report analyzes ( 1 ) shortages in air - to - ground training ordnance required to meet training readiness requirements , ( 2 ) factors that account for the shortages , and ( 3 ) the effect of shortages on training and tactical aviation readiness .
over the past several years senior navy officials have testified before congress about the effects of shortages in training resource on the readiness of aviation units .
at your request , we examined one of these resources — - ordnance for air - to - ground training — to assess the potential for enhancing navy and marine corps tactical aviation unit readiness by improving training ordnance management .
the scope and methodology of our work are described in appendix i .
factors contributing to shortages include ( 1 ) units do not ask for sufficient amounts of ordnance to support their training and exercise needs ; ( 2 ) the navy has given munitions a low funding priority , which has resulted in low ordnance stockpile - levels of live munitions and shortages of inert training munitions ; and ( 3 ) the navy has poorly allocated available ordnance .
when requirements are understated , it becomes less likely that future stockpiles will meet future requirements .
most notably , it requested less than 50 percent of its required laser - guided training rounds and less than 15 percent of its flare requirement in fiscal years 1998 to 2000 .
a well - justified training program linked to readiness would also aid in developing and supporting a procurement program that meets its needs .
data on naval air forces pacific requests were not available for fiscal year 2000 , but in the other 3 years its requests were less than its training instruction requirements for about 40 percent of the items reviewed .
in 1997 , the department of defense ( dod ) issued instruction 3000.4 , which sets forth policies , roles and responsibilities , time frames and procedures to guide the services as they develop their ordnance requirements .
guidance that details how units should go about this process would greatly aid units in developing their requests .
the navy's annual ordnance procurement budget request submitted to congress includes aggregated war reserve ordnance and training ordnance requirements making it impossible for congress to understand how funding decisions affect training readiness .
its requests for laser - guided rounds were less than requirements in all 3 years and its request for guided bombs was less than requirements in 2 of the 3 years .
such an exception report could also serve to facilitate the development of alternative training strategies that maximize readiness within these resource constraints .
marine force atlantic training ordnance requests during the period understated its training requirements for 78 percent of its requests , while marine force pacific requested less than its requirements for 69 percent of its requests .
we disagree with dod and continue to believe that our recommendation has merit and would not be counterproductive .
the calculation of the total munitions requirement is not constrained by anticipated funding limitations .
overall , naval air forces atlantic requested less ordnance than required to meet its training instruction requirements for 25 percent of its requests during the period .
