cbp's layered security strategy is based on initiatives and programs that include , among other things , analyzing information to identify shipments that may be at high risk of transporting weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) or other contraband , working with foreign governments to examine u.s. - bound shipments at foreign ports participating in the container security initiative ( csi ) and secure freight initiative ( sfi ) , and providing benefits to companies that comply with cbp's minimum security criteria through the customs - trade partnership against terrorism ( c - tpat ) program .
the security and accountability for every port act ( safe port act ) of 2006 , enacted in october 2006 , established a statutory framework for key programs within cbp's layered security strategy that previously had not specifically been required by law .
cbp has developed a layered security strategy to focus its limited resources on targeting and examining high - risk cargo shipments that could pose a risk while allowing other cargo shipments to proceed without unduly disrupting commerce arriving in the united states .
within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , cbp is responsible for administering cargo security and reducing the vulnerabilities associated with the supply chain .
according to dhs , balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the free flow of commerce , part of cbp's mission , remains an ongoing challenge .
criminal or terrorist attacks using cargo shipments can cause disruptions to the supply chain and can limit global economic growth and productivity .
my statement today discusses the progress and challenges associated with cbp's implementation of maritime cargo security initiatives and programs responsible for enhancing the security of the global supply chain .
our prior work has shown that cbp has made substantial progress in implementing various initiatives and programs that , collectively , have enhanced cargo security , but some challenges remain .
examples of progress and challenges in the areas of ( 1 ) using information for improving targeting and risk assessment of cargo shipments , ( 2 ) partnerships with foreign governments , and ( 3 ) partnerships with the trade industry are discussed below .
a brief description of the key initiatives and programs that constitute cbp's layered security strategy is provided in appendix i .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) initiatives and programs to enhance maritime cargo security .
this statement is based on reports and testimonies we issued from april 2008 through january 2015 related to maritime cargo security — with selected updates on how dhs and cbp have responded to our prior recommendations .
we made recommendations to cbp to strengthen c - tpat program management and oversight .
cargo containers can be filled overseas at many different locations and they are transported through complex logistics networks before reaching u.s. ports .
the u.s. economy is dependent on the expeditious flow of millions of tons of cargo each day through the global supply chain — the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailers .
cargo containers are an important segment of the global supply chain and play a vital role in the movement of cargo between global trading partners .
