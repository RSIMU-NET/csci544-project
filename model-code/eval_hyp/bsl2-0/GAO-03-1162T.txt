however , many employees have expressed concerns about the proposals that affect pay .
the eac recognizes and appreciates the efforts the comptroller general has made to address employees' concerns regarding provisions affecting pay by ( 1 ) providing assurances that the new system will sustain employees' purchasing power and provide parity with prevailing locality pay , ( 2 ) proposing short - and longer - term modifications to gao's performance management system , and ( 3 ) incorporating a 2-year transition period for implementation of the new system .
to a lesser extent , staff are concerned about changes to pay protections provided under traditional federal employment rules .
specifically , many staff are concerned about the potential negative impact of the change in the basis for annual salary increases , although some staff recognize the potential benefits for additional reward and management flexibility .
in summary , gao employees generally support many of the provisions in the proposed legislation .
for example , most employees expressed support for the provision to make gao's authority to offer voluntary early provisions to enhance vacation time for upper - level hires and relocation expenses deemed necessary by the comptroller general to recruit and retain top employees , and the provision to establish an exchange program with the private sector .
we hope that if the legislation is enacted , the comptroller general will continue to be responsive to the concerns of employees as the agency moves forward in implementing these changes .
staff have differing opinions on the provision to change gao's name to the government accountability office .
the eac operates as an umbrella organization that incorporates representatives of gao's long - standing employee organizations including groups representing the disabled , hispanics , asian - americans , african - americans , gays and lesbians , veterans , and women , as well as employees in various pay bands , attorneys , and administrative and professional staff .
although we have limited quantitative data in this regard and recognize that not all employees have the same opinions regarding all provisions of the proposed legislation , we believe our testimony is representative of a substantial cross - section of gao employees .
as established in our charter , the employee advisory council serves as an advisory body to the comptroller general and other senior executives by: seeking and conveying the views and concerns of the individual employee groups it represents while being sensitive to the mutual interests of all employees , regardless of their grade , band , or classification group ; proposing solutions to concerns raised by employees , as appropriate ; providing input by assessing and commenting on gao policies , procedures , plans , and practices ; and , communicating issues and concerns of the comptroller general and other senior managers to employees .
the members of the eac represent a variety of employee groups and almost all employees outside of the senior executive service ( more than 3,000 of gao's 3,200 employees or 94 percent ) .
the comptroller general formed the eac about 4 years ago to be fully representative of the gao population and advise him on issues pertaining to both management and employees .
in preparing this statement , the eac considered the results of discussions with constituents , and input from council representatives , including information gathered from employees during the initial introduction of the proposal and comments provided on the comptroller general's revised proposal .
