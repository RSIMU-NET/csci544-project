because detailing effectively encourages the prescription of more expensive , brand - name drugs , data suggest that health care costs are measurably increased by detailing .
these questions are particularly salient in the market for health related data .
this general process is used across a wide array of industries , and it raises a number of first amendment and privacy questions .
for example , courts have struggled with fundamental questions , such as whether the sale and aggregation of data is speech at all , and , as discussed in the cases below , what standard of scrutiny to apply to restrictions on trade in data if it is speech .
the states reasoned that if detailing were less effective , then doctors might be more likely to prescribe generic drugs , which are cheaper than brand - name drugs , and health care costs overall would go down .
data can be used particularly to better target advertising and other forms of marketing to specific individuals .
also , the states were interested in lowering the costs of health care .
the preferences of individuals can be aggregated and analyzed in such a way as to better predict future habits .
detailing is very expensive ; as a result , pharmaceutical manufacturers only engage in detailing for more expensive ( i.e. , brand - name ) prescription drugs .
for example , pharmaceutical manufacturers use a process known as detailing to market prescription drugs .
health related data can be very valuable to researchers , scientists , and other academics .
it can be just as valuable to participants in the market for the provision of health care .
in the information age , data of varying types have become increasingly valuable .
detailing involves sending representatives of the pharmaceutical manufacturers to individual doctors' offices with information about prescription drugs and their various uses .
the companies that collect , analyze , and sell these data challenged the laws , claiming that they were an unconstitutional restriction of their free speech rights under the first amendment , as incorporated against the states by the fourteenth amendment .
three states — maine , new hampshire , and vermont — enacted statutes to restrict the sale and use of prescriber history data for the purposes of marketing ( though not for any other purpose ) without the consent of the doctor .
the more information a detailer has about the doctor ( or medication prescriber ) that he or she is planning to market to , the better targeted , and more effective , the detailing becomes .
as discussed below , the states claimed to be protecting the privacy interest of the doctors .
an industry has developed to collect , aggregate , and analyze these prescriber data .
consequently , information about the past prescribing practices of doctors can be valuable to detailers in designing their marketing strategies .
other doctors find the sharing of their prescriber history without their consent , and its subsequent use as a marketing tool , to be an invasion of privacy .
data gatherers collect information ( by purchasing it ) from pharmacies and other entities that have vast troves of prescriber history data .
some doctors find better - targeted detailing to be useful .
