in 2009 , congress required dod to establish a task force to assess the effectiveness of dod programs and policies developed to assist recovering servicemembers and to make recommendations for the dod task continuous improvements of such policies and programs .
additionally , congressional committees held multiple hearings in 2010 and 2011 that highlighted ongoing difficulties facing these servicemembers and veterans , including issues with duplication and poor coordination among case management and care coordination programs , delays in completing the disability evaluation process , and the lack of full interoperability between dod's and va's computer systems .
these reports prompted broader questions about whether the departments of defense ( dod ) and veterans affairs ( va ) were fully prepared to meet the needs of the growing number of servicemembers and veterans returning from recent conflicts .
the ndaa 2008 required that we report on dod's and va's progress in developing and implementing joint policy on issues related to the care , management , and transition of recovering servicemembers .
congress subsequently passed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( ndaa 2008 ) requiring the secretary of defense and the secretary of veterans affairs to jointly develop and implement policy , to the extent feasible , to improve the care , management , and transition of recovering servicemembers .
to elevate the response to concerns raised by these review groups , dod and va established the wounded , ill , and injured senior oversight committee ( senior oversight committee ) in may 2007 .
because of its related ongoing work , the senior oversight committee also assumed responsibility for addressing these requirements .
these groups identified common areas of concern including: inadequate case management to ensure continuity of care , confusing disability evaluation systems , and insufficient sharing of servicemembers' health records and other data between dod and va — all long - standing problems that we have reported on extensively .
force on the care , management , and transition of recovering wounded , ill , and injured members of the armed forces — referred to as the recovering warrior task force — issued its first report in september 2011 ; it contained 21 recommendations on a variety of issues affecting recovering servicemembers .
in this review , we are reporting on 1. the extent to which dod and va have resolved persistent problems facing recovering servicemembers and veterans as they navigate the recovery care continuum and 2. the reasons dod and va leadership have not been able to fully resolve any remaining problems .
despite actions taken by dod and va to address the problems identified at walter reed in 2007 , concerns remain that recovering servicemembers and veterans continue to face many of the same problems as they did in 2007 navigating the recovery care continuum , from acute medical treatment and stabilization , through rehabilitation , to reintegration — either back to active duty or to the civilian community as a veteran .
several review groups were subsequently tasked with investigating the reported problems and identifying recommendations .
the committee was intended to operate on a short - term basis to review and implement the recommendations made by the various review groups and improve seamlessness in the provision of care for recovering servicemembers and veterans .
