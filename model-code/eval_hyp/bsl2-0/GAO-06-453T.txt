even modest progress would yield significant revenue ; each 1 percent reduction would likely yield nearly $3 billion annually .
corporate income tax and employment tax underreporting accounted for an additional $84 billion .
underreporting of income by businesses and individuals accounted for most of the estimated $345 billion tax gap for 2001 , with individual income tax underreporting alone accounting for $197 billion , or over half of the total gap .
reducing the current tax gap would contribute to our fiscal sustainability while simultaneously improving fairness for those citizens who fully and timely meet their tax obligations .
these strategies could include efforts to regularly obtain data on the extent of , and reasons for , noncompliance ; simplify the tax code ; provide quality services to taxpayers ; enhance enforcement of the tax laws by utilizing enforcement tools such as tax withholding , information reporting , and penalties ; leverage technology ; and maximize resource allocation .
their failure to pay taxes increases the burden of funding the nation's commitments for those taxpayers who voluntarily pay their taxes .
reducing the tax gap will be a challenging , long - term task and progress will require attacking the gap on multiple fronts and with multiple strategies over a sustained period .
the internal revenue service ( irs ) most recently estimated a gross tax gap that reached $345 billion for tax year 2001 .
irs estimated that it would recover around $55 billion through late payments and irs enforcement actions , resulting in a net tax gap of around $290 billion .
given the persistence and size of the tax gap , we need not only to consider options that have been previously proposed but also explore new administrative and legislative approaches to reducing the tax gap .
our current path also will increasingly constrain our ability to address emerging and unexpected budgetary needs and increase the burdens that will be faced by our children , grandchildren , and future generations .
finally , i will discuss the significance of reducing the tax gap and various means to achieve that goal , including measuring the extent of , and reasons for , noncompliance ; simplifying the tax code ; improving taxpayer service ; enhancing irs enforcement through the use of tools such as withholding , information reporting , and penalties ; leveraging technology ; and optimizing resource allocation .
for context in considering the tax gap , i will first provide the committee with an overview of the federal government's fiscal condition and the challenges we will face in funding our nation's commitments .
let me begin by highlighting three major points: gao's long - term budget simulations show that over the long term we face large and growing structural deficits due primarily to known demographic trends , rising health care costs , and lower federal revenues as a percentage of the economy .
the tax gap arises when taxpayers intentionally or unintentionally fail to comply with the tax laws .
continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode , if not suddenly damage , our economy , our standard of living , and ultimately our national security .
these efforts were conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
