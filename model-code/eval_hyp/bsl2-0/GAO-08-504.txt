in some high - risk areas , insurers have sought to increase their premium rates and reduce their exposure .
in some states , such as florida , mississippi , and north and south carolina , participation in these programs has grown tremendously since 2004 , exposing the programs to potentially large losses .
to address these issues , a number of coastal states have created programs to sell wind insurance in the highest - risk areas within their states .
the potential for extensive damages following hurricanes can also mean that insurance in hurricane prone areas ( primarily on the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states ) may not be widely available and , when it is , may be unaffordable .
such disputes arise because events such as hurricanes are multiperil events , making determinations of the cause of damage difficult .
private property - casualty insurance policies may cover wind damage but exclude flood damage , and in some cases , the presence of flood damage in addition to wind damage may raise questions about the extent to which wind damage is covered .
this report discusses ( 1 ) the resources and processes that the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) would need to implement the program ; ( 2 ) the steps that fema would need to take to determine premium rates that adequately reflected all expected costs ; and ( 3 ) the possible effects of the program on policyholders , insurance market participants , and the federal government .
3121 , the flood insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 , in september 2007 .
as of november 2007 , some of these disputes had yet to be resolved .
adjusters face several challenges in their efforts to determine the cause of damages after multiperil events .
in response to these and other concerns , the house of representatives passed h.r .
3121 would , among other things , create a federal program to provide coverage for both wind and flood damage .
for example , in the aftermath of the unprecedented damage as a result of the 2005 hurricanes , disputes emerged between policyholders and insurers over the extent to which damages would be covered under a homeowner's policy when both high winds and flooding occurred .
for example , the scope of damage following hurricane katrina meant that not enough adjusters were available , that the available adjusters had difficulty reaching the properties , and that evidence at the damage scenes was often limited or compromised .
you asked us to evaluate this program in light of current deliberations about the future of the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) .
determining the extent of the damage caused by each peril can be difficult , leading to disputes between policyholders and private insurers and delays in payments that property owners need for living and rebuilding expenses .
in addition , we reviewed academic and other studies of coastal wind insurance issues , congressional budget office ( cbo ) reviews , and hurricane loss data .
3121 that were related to the establishment of a federal flood and wind insurance program .
we discussed the potential implications and effects of these provisions with officials from fema , the nfip , the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , state insurance regulators , state wind insurance program operators , insurers , reinsurers , insurance and reinsurance associations , insurance agent associations , risk - modeling organizations , actuarial consultants , the american academy of actuaries , and others .
