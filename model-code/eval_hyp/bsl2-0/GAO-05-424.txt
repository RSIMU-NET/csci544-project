agency compliance with these requirements is governed by omb regulation ( 5 c.f.r .
under pra , agencies are required to submit all proposed information collections to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for approval .
in an effort to strengthen the act , the congress amended the act in 1995 to establish , among other things , more detailed agency clearance requirements .
each year , agencies submit about 3,000 of these to be approved or reapproved by omb .
governmentwide , agencies maintain about 8,000 information collections covered by the act .
under the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) , agencies are required to minimize the paperwork burden they impose on the public to carry out their missions and to maximize the practical utility of the information they collect .
based on governmentwide estimates of paperwork burden , the public spent about 8.1 billion hours in 2003 responding to or complying with information requirements â€” a 50 percent increase since 1989 , when burden was estimated at 5.4 billion hours .
we also examined documents showing burden reductions from separate processes established at ( 1 ) irs's office of taxpayer burden reduction and ( 2 ) the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and interviewed responsible officials .
the cio is to certify that the collection meets 10 standards ( see table 1 ) that are set forth in the act and to provide support for these certifications .
one of these requirements is that before an information collection is submitted to omb for approval , it must be reviewed by the agency's chief information officer ( cio ) .
to help the congress assess whether the act is achieving its purposes and provide information to help the congress in considering reauthorization , you asked us to assess the extent to which , before information collections are submitted to omb for approval , agencies have ( 1 ) established effective processes for cios to review information collections and certify that the 10 standards in the act were met and ( 2 ) complied with the requirements to consult with the public on such collections ; the extent to which agencies ensure that collection forms on agency web sites are properly approved by omb and included in an inventory of approved collections ; and the extent to which agencies ensure that collection forms on agency web sites disclose certain information that the public needs to exercise scrutiny of agency activities , as required by the act .
to determine the extent to which agencies have established effective processes , we performed detailed reviews of paperwork clearance processes and collections at four agencies: the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the department of labor , and irs .
the congress is planning to reexamine the legislative framework for managing information resources , including the pra .
together , these four agencies represent a broad range of paperwork burdens , and in 2003 , they accounted for about 83 percent of the 8.1 billion hours that is the estimated paperwork burden for all federal agencies .
among the other requirements of the act is that agencies are to consult with the public and affected agencies on various issues , including ways to minimize burden , and provide a 60-day period for the public to comment on collections .
