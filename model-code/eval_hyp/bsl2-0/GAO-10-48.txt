many experts and communities view nuclear energy as a potential means of meeting future energy demands while reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting carbon emissions , a key contributor to climate change .
industry has also raised concerns that local communities will not support the expansion of the nuclear energy industry without a final waste disposition pathway .
in addition to the spent nuclear fuel generated by commercial power reactors , the department of energy ( doe ) owns and manages about 19 percent of the nuclear waste — referred to as doe - managed spent nuclear fuel and high - level waste — which consists of spent nuclear fuel from power , research , and navy shipboard reactors , and high - level nuclear waste from the nation's nuclear weapons program .
to meet this goal , doe has spent more than $14 billion for design , engineering , and testing activities .
specifically , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of the yucca mountain repository ; ( 2 ) and identify alternative nuclear waste management approaches ; ( 3 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of storing the nuclear waste at two centralized sites ; and ( 4 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of continuing to store the nuclear waste at its current locations .
 ( see fig .
experts and regulators believe the nuclear waste , if properly stored and monitored , can be kept safe and secure on - site for decades ; but communities across the country have raised concerns about the waste's lethal nature and the possibility of natural disasters or terrorism , particularly at sites near urban centers or sources of drinking water .
for example , the safety , health , and environmental risks for each are very different , which needs to be considered in the policy debate on nuclear waste management decisions .
the u.s. national inventory of 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste — enough to fill a football field more than 15 feet deep — has been accumulating at 80 sites in 35 states since the mid - 1940s and is expected to more than double to 153,000 metric tons by 2055 .
since then , the administration has announced plans to study alternatives to geologic disposal at yucca mountain before making a decision on a future nuclear waste management strategy , which the administration said could include reprocessing or other complementary strategies .
in this context , you asked us to identify key aspects of doe's nuclear waste management program and other possible management approaches .
under the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 ( nwpa ) , as amended , doe was to evaluate one or more national geologic repositories that would be designated to permanently store commercial spent nuclear fuel and doe - managed spent nuclear fuel and high - level waste .
 ( see app .
high - level nuclear waste consists mostly of spent nuclear fuel removed from commercial power reactors and is considered one of the most hazardous substances on earth .
in june 2008 , doe submitted a license application to the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) for approval to construct the repository .
