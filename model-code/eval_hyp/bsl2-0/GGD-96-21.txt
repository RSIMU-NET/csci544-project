you specifically asked us for information on ( 1 ) how irs addressed the problems discussed in our december 1994 report on the status of the program and , if the problems persist , how they would affect final tcmp results ; ( 2 ) informational sources other than tcmp that irs could use to target its audits more effectively ; and ( 3 ) the relevancy of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals .
this report responds to your september 12 , 1995 , request to provide information on the internal revenue service's ( irs ) taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) for tax year 1994 .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine how irs addressed the problems discussed in our 1994 tcmp status report and , if the problems persist , how they will affect final tcmp results ; ( 2 ) identify informational resources other than tcmp that irs could use to target its audits more effectively ; and ( 3 ) assess the value of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals .
currently planned to include about 153,000 tax returns , this tcmp was designed to obtain compliance information for individuals ( including sole proprietors ) ; small corporations ( i.e. , those with assets of $10 million or less ) ; s corporations ; and partnerships .
congress and federal and state agencies have used tcmp data for policy analysis , revenue estimating , and research .
finally , in its tcmp training for auditors , irs plans to emphasize the need to make effective use of internal data to reduce the amount of information requested from taxpayers , thus reducing the burden imposed on those taxpayers .
basically , these concerns centered on irs being able to ( 1 ) meet major milestones for starting audits , ( 2 ) collect audit adjustment data on partners and s corporation shareholders , ( 3 ) collect data on potentially misclassified workers , ( 4 ) develop data collection systems , ( 5 ) make it easier for researchers to access tcmp audit workpapers , and ( 6 ) develop a tcmp research plan .
for about 30 years , tcmp has been irs' primary program for gathering comprehensive and reliable taxpayer compliance data .
irs uses the data for measuring compliance levels , estimating the tax gap , identifying compliance issues , developing formulas for objectively selecting returns for audit , and allocating audit resources .
irs attributed the delay to the uncertainties about its fiscal year 1996 budget .
to determine the relevancy of tcmp data for new tax system proposals , we reviewed various published documents on these systems and compared them to the current income tax system .
to determine the actions irs took on the concerns we raised in our 1994 report , we reviewed tcmp documents and discussed the actions taken with irs officials responsible for designing and implementing the program .
to determine whether other information sources could be used to replace tcmp , we relied on work we had done on tcmp and we discussed with irs officials how irs could use other potential data sources , including state and nongovernment sources .
irs also plans to place greater emphasis on quality audits to ensure that accurate data are collected .
