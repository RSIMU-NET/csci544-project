over the past several years , concerns have been raised about va's ability to maximize its third - party collections to enhance revenues .
concerned about these issues you asked that we report on ( 1 ) trends in va's third - party collections , ( 2 ) problems in collections operations , and ( 3 ) va's approach for improving collections .
the total number of veterans va treated has increased from 2.6 million in fiscal year 1996 to 4.3 million in fiscal year 2002 , and va predicts continuing growth in its patient workload .
higher income veterans or those without service - connected disabilities have comprised a significant portion of this growth , and third - party collections are intended to help pay for the cost of their care .
we testified in september 2001 that problems in va's collections operations — such as inadequate patient intake procedures to gather insurance information , insufficient physician documentation , a shortage of qualified coders , and insufficient automation — diminished va's collections .
va officials told us that cbo's approach would combine the vha revenue cycle improvement plan of september 2001 ( 2001 improvement plan ) with additional initiatives , such as the development of an automated financial system that better serves billing needs and additional performance measures and standards for overseeing collection units' activities .
for that work , we examined va's collections data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and available data for 2003 ; reviewed relevant va documents , such as the veterans health administration's ( vha ) revenue cycle improvement plan of september 2001 ; and interviewed officials in va headquarters and in 3 of va's 21 health care networks — network 2 ( albany ) , network 9 ( nashville ) , and network 22 ( long beach ) .
known as third - party collections , these collections are va's largest source of revenue to supplement its medical care appropriation , and they help pay for veterans' growing demand for care .
however , given today's tight budget environment , it is important that va resolve its operational problems and sustain its attention and commitment to maximizing third - party collections .
in summary , va's third - party collections for fiscal year 2002 totaled $687 million , 32 percent more than for fiscal year 2001 , and available data for the first half of fiscal year 2003 show that $386 million has been collected so far .
since the introduction of the 2001 improvement plan , va has made some progress in resolving operational problems , such as fully implementing electronic billing , mandating the use of electronic medical records , and using preregistration software .
in may 2002 , va established the chief business office ( cbo ) in vha to develop a new approach for va's collections activity .
as a result , va lacks a reliable estimate of uncollected dollars and therefore does not have the basis to assess its systemwide operational effectiveness .
although va reported an increase in collections , we found that operational problems , such as missed billing opportunities , continued to limit collections .
cbo's initiatives could further enhance collections by identifying root causes of problems in collections operations , providing a focused approach to addressing the root causes , establishing performance measures , and holding responsible parties accountable for achieving the performance standards .
