no similar legislation has yet been introduced in the 111 th congress .
in january 2006 , it issued its report on orphan works , which includes proposed legislative language to address the problem identified .
this report surveys the findings of the report on orphan works ( "report" ) , considers the copyright office's proposed amendment to the copyright act to address the issue , and analyzes introduced orphan works legislation in the 109 th and 110 th congresses .

in response to requests by several members of congress in january 2005 , the u.s .
hearings were held in the 109 th and 110 th congresses on the orphan works problem .
copyright office agreed to examine issues surrounding "orphan works. .
the office accepted written comments and hosted public roundtable discussions on the topic .
the copyright office issued a notice of inquiry requesting public comment from interested parties on the subject .
although congress has not yet passed orphan works legislation , recent developments in the private sector have further increased public interest in the orphan works problem .
indeed , this committee has already invested significant time in evaluating the orphan works problem and weighing possible solutions .
no legislation relating to orphan works has yet been introduced in the 111 th congress as of the date of this report .
such alteration should be undertaken by congress if it is undertaken at all .
the google book settlement would frustrate the committee's efforts and make it exceedingly difficult for congress to move forward .
that process is not over .
whatever the outcome , congress is much better situated than the judiciary to consider such important and far - reaching changes to the copyright system .
what follows is an analysis of orphan works bills that were considered by the 109 th and 110 th congresses .
in a hearing before the house judiciary committee in september 2009 , the register of copyrights offered her views about the proposed settlement's impact on future orphan works legislation: congress should be particularly concerned about the settlement since it would interfere with the longstanding efforts of congress and many other parties to address the issue of orphan works .
â€¢ other legislative solutions .
a much more productive path would be for google to engage with this committee and with other stakeholders to discuss whether and to what degree a diligent search for the rights holder should be a precondition of a user receiving the benefits of orphan works legislation , or whether a solution that is more like a compulsory license may make sense for those engaged in mass scanning .
specifically , questions have been raised about the fate of orphan works under the proposed settlement agreement that would resolve litigation regarding google's proposal to scan , digitize , and index millions of print books in the collections of several major libraries , without seeking the permission of the copyright owners of those books .
the agreement calls for google to compensate rights holders for prior and future uses of their work .
the broad scope of the out - of - print provisions and the large class of copyright owners they would affect will dramatically impinge on the exclusive rights of authors , publishers , their heirs and successors .
