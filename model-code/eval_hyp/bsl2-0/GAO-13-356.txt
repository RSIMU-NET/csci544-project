to focus and sustain attention on agency performance and improvement , congress enacted the government performance and results act modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) .
gprama , along with related office of management and budget ( omb ) guidance , established and defined performance management responsibilities for agency officials in key management roles: the agency head , chief operating officer ( coo ) , performance improvement officer ( pio ) , deputy pio , goal leader , and deputy goal leader .
our previous work has found that two of the most important elements that contribute to sustained performance improvement are a demonstrated commitment from top agency leadership and clear lines of accountability for making management improvements .
the objectives of this report are to ( 1 ) examine the status of federal agencies' implementation of the performance management leadership roles under gprama , and ( 2 ) evaluate the role of the pic in facilitating the exchange of best practices and improving agency program management and performance .
among other responsibilities , the pic is charged with facilitating the exchange of successful performance management practices among agencies and assisting omb in implementing certain gprama requirements .
this report is part of a series of reports under our mandate to examine how agencies are implementing gprama , such as by conducting quarterly performance reviews to assess progress on agency priority goals .
the performance and results of federal agencies have a significant impact on many issues of great importance to the american public , ranging from public health to homeland security to training the country's workforce .
gprama also established in law the performance improvement council ( pic ) , chaired by omb's deputy director for management and composed of pios from various federal agencies .
the officials in these roles constitute an agency's performance management leadership team .
in order to understand gprama implementation in more detail and put survey results in context for both objectives , we conducted case studies of two cfo act agencies — the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and the national science foundation ( nsf ) — focusing on their implementation of performance management leadership roles and participation in the pic .
we also interviewed omb staff and officials at the office of personnel management ( opm ) about their work under gprama , including their work with agencies and the pic in implementing gprama .
in addition , in order to understand the priority goal leader role and its contributions to performance management , we selected three of hhs's six agency priority goals and two of nsf's three agency priority goals and interviewed the responsible goal leaders .
to further address both objectives , we reviewed gprama and related omb guidance about the key management roles and the pic .
to address both objectives , we administered a survey of pios at the 24 agencies covered by the chief financial officers act of 1990 ( cfo act ) from october 2012 through december 2012 and received responses from all 24 pios .
we selected these agencies because they have differing characteristics that may affect implementation , such as agency size and the career status of the official in the pio role .
for goals that had two goal leaders assigned , we interviewed one of the responsible goal leaders .
