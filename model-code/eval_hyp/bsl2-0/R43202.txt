this report briefly examines the evolution and economic effects of the qiz program for jordan and egypt during the past 15 years and identifies some related issues for congress .
the qiz program , attached to the u.s. - israel free trade agreement ( usifta ) , is one such program .
the qiz program is one tool available to congress for assisting on both counts .
the current ongoing wave of upheaval in the middle east and north africa that started in late 2011 raises the potential for simultaneous political and economic transitions .
the motivation for these programs can be political and / or economic .
the united states has a number of trade preference programs which offer unilateral / non - reciprocal duty - free treatment for certain products from designated countries meeting specific eligibility requirements .
it was designed to strengthen the middle east peace process while stimulating the economies of jordan and egypt .
it does not address the current turmoil in egypt .
for a discussion of this issue , see crs report rl33003 , egypt: background and u.s. relations , by [author name scrubbed] .
in addition , new investment led to the creation of additional exports .
it focused on helping countries in their efforts to undertake reforms that could lead to trade liberalization and transitions to democracy .
the qualifying industrial zone ( qiz ) program was created by the 1996 west bank and gaza strip free trade benefits act , which amended the 1985 u.s. - israel free trade agreement ( usifta ) .
a key impetus for egypt's participation was that the world trade organization ( wto ) agreement on textiles and clothing ( atc ) , which went into effect january 1 , 1995 , was due to expire on january 1 , 2005 .
jordan ( in 1979 ) and egypt ( in 1994 ) were the only two arab countries in the middle east - north africa ( mena ) region that had signed peace treaties with israel .
after egypt entered the qiz program , some of its apparel exports quickly shifted from non - qiz tariff , to qiz tariff - free status .
once the atc protection was gone , quota limits would be lifted , and apparel exports destined for the united states from countries such as china could crowd out those from egypt and other countries .
congress had two main motives for this legislation: to help broaden political support for the middle east peace process and end the arab economic boycott of israel .
egypt's qiz program started out slowly , and has grown considerably .
the second initiative was the middle - east / north africa trade and investment partnership initiative ( mena - tip ) , announced by president barack obama in 2011 .
 ( see map , figure 1 . ) .
this led to broader and more comprehensive u.s. - middle east trade initiatives to assist the region .
although it observed jordan's rapid economic growth after it began its qiz program , egypt did not enter the qiz program until 2004 , seven years after the offer was formally extended by congress .
