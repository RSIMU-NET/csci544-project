most erisa provisions deal with pension plans .
an employee benefit plan may be either a pension plan ( which provides retirement benefits ) or a welfare benefit plan ( which provides other kinds of employee benefits such as health and disability benefits ) .
erisa does not require employers to provide pensions or welfare benefit plans , but those that do must comply with its requirements .
erisa sets standards that pension plans must meet in regard to: who must be covered ( participation ) , how long a person has to work to be entitled to a pension ( vesting ) , and how much must be set aside each year to pay future pensions ( funding ) .
in order to encourage employers to establish pension plans , congress has granted certain tax deductions and deferrals to qualified plans .
to be qualified for tax preferences under the internal revenue code ( irc ) , plans must meet requirements with respect to pension plan contributions , benefits , and distributions , and there are special rules for plans that primarily benefit highly compensated employees or business owners .
erisa supersedes state laws relating to employee benefit plans except for certain matters such as state insurance , banking and securities laws , and divorce property settlement orders by state courts .
erisa also established the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) to insure that plan participants receive promised benefits , up to a statutory limit , should a plan terminate with a lack of sufficient assets to pay promised benefits .
the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) protects the interests of participants and beneficiaries in private - sector employee benefit plans .
responsibility for enforcing erisa is shared by the department of the treasury , the department of labor , and the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) .
governmental plans and church plans generally are not subject to the law .
erisa sets fiduciary standards that require employee benefit plan funds be handled prudently and in the best interests of the participants .
it requires plans to inform participants of their rights under the plan and of the plan's financial status , and it gives plan participants the right to sue in federal court to recover benefits that they have earned under the plan .
in the department of the treasury , the internal revenue service oversees standards for plan participation , vesting , and funding .
the department of labor regulates fiduciary standards and requirements for reporting and disclosure of financial information .
in order for an employer - sponsored retirement plan to qualify for federal income tax deferrals and deductions , it must comply with the pension - related provisions of the internal revenue code ( irc ) .
the pbgc — a government - owned corporation — administers the pension benefit insurance program .
the pension - related provisions of the irc require plans to cover rank - and - file workers , and they include "nondiscrimination rules" that prohibit qualified plans from favoring highly - compensated employees with respect to eligibility or benefits .
title iii of erisa covers jurisdictional , administrative and enforcement matters .
under this title , various enforcement and regulatory responsibilities are coordinated between the department of labor , the treasury department , and the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) .
