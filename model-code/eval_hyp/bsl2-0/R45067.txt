this report describes the chgme program's ( 1 ) purpose and structure , ( 2 ) history , and ( 3 ) authorizations and appropriations .
the use of discretionary appropriations to fund chgme differs from other federal sources of graduate medical education ( gme ) support .
the program is administered by the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and is authorized in section 340e of the public health service act ( phsa ) .
chgme receives annual discretionary appropriations , which are authorized through fy2023 .
more information on other gme programs and how programs interact is available in crs report r44376 , federal support for graduate medical education: an overview .
for example , medicare — the largest source of gme payments — is mandatory .
t he children's hospitals graduate medical education ( chgme ) program provides direct financial support to children's hospitals — those that treat primarily patients below the age of 18 — to train medical residents and fellows .
it also provides select program data , including the number of hospitals supported under the program , their location , the amount of funding they receive , and the number of residents trained .
finally , the report discusses alternative sources of gme funding available .
though the reauthorization did not include substantive changes , policy changes to the program have been included in various policy proposals that would consolidate gme support ( e.g. , " fy2019 president's budget request " ) .
this differs from other and larger sources of federally supported gme program ( e.g. , medicare ) .
despite these increases , some children lack access to pediatric subspecialty care ( see text box ) .
the reauthorization did not include substantive program changes .
the chgme program is also implementing a quality bonus system and providing additional payments to programs that provide data and eventually meet set targets .
given this , the program and its role in the complement of federal gme support may remain an area of congressional interest .
appropriations for the chgme program were reauthorized in 2018 through the end of fy2023 .
moreover , some children's hospitals report physician vacancies and difficulties hiring in certain subspecialties .
chgme payments are structured similarly to medicare gme payments .
as such , the chgme program data may be useful for congress to examine to determine whether such data are sufficient and whether it would be useful for other programs to collect such data elements .
since the chgme program began , the size of the pediatric subspecialty workforce has increased .
115-241 ) , which increased the amount of funding authorized and extended the period of the program's authorization of appropriations to fy2023 .
these newly eligible hospitals were defined as ( 1 ) free - standing ; ( 2 ) having a medicare payment agreement and being excluded from the medicare ipps ; ( 3 ) having an inpatient population composed predominantly of individuals under 18 years of age ; and ( 4 ) having an approved medical residency training program , but not one qualified to receive medicare gme payments .
researchers have found that some geographic areas have a shortage of pediatric subspecialists , leading some children to seek care with subspecialists who focus on adults , which may adversely affect the care the children receive .
