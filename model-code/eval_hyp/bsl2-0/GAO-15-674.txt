this report discusses the extent to which dod ( 1 ) has purchased alternative fuels and has demonstrated that these fuels can meet its safety , performance , and reliability standards ; ( 2 ) has a process for purchasing alternative fuels for military operations that takes into consideration any cost differences between alternative and conventional fuels ; and ( 3 ) has used the defense production act ( dpa ) authorities to promote the development of a domestic biofuel industry .
dod largely depends on petroleum fuels for military operations .
dod's primary alternative fuels goal , according to dod policy , is to ensure operational military readiness , improve battlespace effectiveness , and further the flexibility of military operations through the ability to use multiple , reliable fuel sources .
one means of potentially achieving this goal is dod's investment in alternative fuels — an investment that dod cites as a prudent insurance policy against future oil supply disruptions and high prices .
in fiscal year 2014 , the departments of the navy , air force , and army purchased about 3.8 billion gallons of petroleum fuel and other fuel products at a total cost of about $14.4 billion ( not adjusted for inflation ) .
further , dod policy indicates alternative fuels can serve as a mechanism for mitigating anti - access / area denial effects , and for enabling flexibility in supply chain logistics .
to determine the extent to which dod has purchased alternative fuels , and has demonstrated that these fuels can meet its safety , performance , and reliability standards , we obtained and analyzed the military departments' alternative fuel purchase data — including quantities , costs , and funding sources — covering fiscal years 2007 through 2014 .
in addition , the 2014 quadrennial defense review notes that energy improvements enhance range , endurance , and agility , particularly in the future security environment where logistics may be constrained .
given the realities of global oil markets , according to dod's operational energy strategy , a disruption of oil supplies is plausible and increasingly likely in the coming decades and the volatility of oil prices will continue to pose a budgetary challenge .
according to dod , one of the department's strategic operational energy goals is the expansion of its energy supply options .
a majority of dod's energy usage goes toward its operational energy needs — that is , the energy required for training , moving , and sustaining military forces and weapon platforms for military operations .
you asked us to examine aspects of dod's investment in alternative fuels .
 ) strategy ( may 1 , 2015 ) .
the department of defense ( dod ) is the single largest consumer of energy in the federal government .
through reviews of dod guidance , reports , publications , and briefings and interviews with dod officials , we obtained information about the reason ( s ) why the military departments purchased alternative fuels and how these fuels were put to use .
we concluded that the purchase data are of sufficient reliability to describe the order of magnitude of dod's funding toward alternative fuels .
in addition , we obtained data on the military departments' conventional petroleum and other fuel product purchases from fiscal years 2007 through 2014 based on database queries that dod officials conducted from march through april 2015 .
