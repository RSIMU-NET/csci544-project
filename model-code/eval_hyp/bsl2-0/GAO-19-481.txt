the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , an agency within hhs , is responsible for overseeing medicaid at the federal level , including the epsdt benefit .
in fiscal year 2017 , approximately 40 million medicaid beneficiaries were entitled to receive espdt services .
finally , as part of a separate effort conducted jointly with states , cms has sought to improve the quality and usefulness of state - reported medicaid data through its transformed medicaid statistical information system ( t - msis ) .
according to cms , the agency will increasingly rely on the child core set to measure health care outcomes for medicaid and chip beneficiaries , rather than the cms - 416 .
cms intends for t - msis to provide more information to improve medicaid oversight and to reduce the number of reports cms requires states to submit , including the cms - 416 and the child core set .
states may also voluntarily report information to cms annually on health care services provided to epsdt beneficiaries , as well as individuals covered under the children's health insurance program ( chip ) through the child core set .
specifically , we analyzed data on the three primary espdt services reported on the cms - 416: ( 1 ) well - child screenings , ( 2 ) preventive dental services , and ( 3 ) blood lead screenings .
cms oversight of the epsdt benefit ; and 3. what is known about the capabilities of t - msis data to replace states' cms - 416 and child core set reporting .
you asked us to review the extent to which medicaid beneficiaries aged 20 and under receive health care services under the epsdt benefit .
however , we and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) office of inspector general have previously found that millions of beneficiaries had not received the services to which they were entitled .
states are required to report annually on the provision of certain epsdt services through the form cms - 416 .
the epsdt benefit is a comprehensive set of covered services for medicaid's youngest beneficiaries that includes periodic screening services , such as physical exams , and diagnostic and treatment services , such as physical therapy and eyeglasses , among other services .
 ( see app .
to help inform its oversight of the epsdt benefit , cms relies , in part , on several data sets submitted by states .
the early and periodic screening , diagnostic , and treatment ( epsdt ) benefit is key to ensuring that eligible beneficiaries aged 20 and under receive appropriate services under medicaid , a joint federal - state health care program for low - income and medically needy individuals .
in this report , we examine 1. what is known about the provision of epsdt services in all states according to what states report on the cms - 416 ; 2 .
our report also describes state practices to promote and facilitate the delivery of epsdt services .
we also interviewed cms officials about their oversight activities , including reviewing data , setting and monitoring epsdt - related performance measure targets , and assisting states with meeting epsdt targets .
for example , cms set performance measures and performance measure targets as part of its oral health initiative .
