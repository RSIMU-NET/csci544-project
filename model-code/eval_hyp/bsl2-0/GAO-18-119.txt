over the years , we have reported on the progress dhs has made and challenges it has faced in implementing its border security efforts .
within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) u.s. border patrol ( border patrol ) is the federal agency responsible for securing the national borders between u.s. ports of entry .
among other things , we recommended that cbp ensure the underlying analyses of the plan were documented in accordance with dhs guidance and internal control standards , develop and apply key attributes for metrics to assess program implementation , and conduct a post - implementation review and operational assessment of sbinet .
in march 2014 , we reported on dhs's progress in deploying land - based surveillance technologies under the atp and efforts to assess the contributions of those technologies to border security .
more specifically , in november 2011 we reported on dhs's planning efforts related to the atp and found that cbp did not have the information needed to fully support and implement the plan .
in november 2005 , dhs launched the secure border initiative , which was responsible for developing a comprehensive border protection system based on tower - mounted radar and camera technologies , known as the secure border initiative network ( sbinet ) .
dhs concurred with these recommendations and has taken action toward addressing some of them , as we discuss later this in report .
however , in january 2011 , in response to internal and external assessments that identified concerns regarding the performance , cost , and schedule for implementing the systems , the secretary of homeland security announced the cancellation of future sbinet systems .
border patrol has taken some steps toward tracking the performance of its surveillance technologies , including requiring agents to record when technologies assist in an apprehension or seizure .
the chief of the border patrol should issue guidance for sectors to improve the quality and usability of its surveillance technology asset assist information to help ensure it has reliable data so that border patrol can be better positioned to measure the impact of these technologies on its border security efforts and inform future investments .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
by 2010 , at a cost of about $1 billion , cbp had deployed 15 sbinet tower systems along 53 miles of arizona's 387- mile border with mexico .
however , additional guidance to better ensure the quality of these data ( including agent training and managerial review ) , would help border patrol determine the mission benefits of its surveillance technologies , which in turn could be used to inform border patrol's resource allocation decisions .
that same month , cbp introduced the arizona border surveillance technology plan ( atp ) for deploying technology along the remainder of the arizona border .
we recommended that cbp apply scheduling best practices , and verify life - cycle cost estimates , among other things .
according to border patrol data , total apprehensions of illegal entrants across the southwest border increased from about 331,000 in fiscal year 2015 to about 409,000 in fiscal year 2016 .
we continue to believe that developing and applying performance metrics for its border technologies , in accordance with our prior recommendation , would help border patrol more fully assess its progress in implementing the southwest border technology plan and determine when mission benefits have been realized .
