however , challenges remain as agencies shift to cloud services .
this shift is intended to achieve two goals: reduce the total investment by the federal government in information technology ( it ) , which currently stands at about $90 billion each year , and realize other stated advantages of cloud adoption , including efficiency , accessibility , collaboration , reliability , and security .
according to a survey conducted in september 2018 , federal it managers continue to express long - held concerns about security in certain cloud environments , the complexity of migrating existing ( "legacy" ) applications to the cloud , a lack of skilled staff to manage certain cloud environments , and uncertain funding .
this report explains what cloud computing is , including different models for cloud deployment and services , and describes the federal government's planning for it reform .
since 2009 , the federal government has been shifting its data storage needs to cloud - based services and away from agency - owned , in - house data centers .
it also provides information on assessments that have been conducted on agency cloud adoption .
finally , the report provides a summary of recent congressional action and presents some possible mechanisms for congress to monitor agencies as they implement cloud computing .
increased cloud adoption is also a stated goal of the federal information technology acquisition reform act ( fitara ) , enacted on december 19 , 2014 .
congress has conducted ongoing oversight of it acquisitions , including cloud computing activity , for many years .
the reforms put forth in the plan were focused on eliminating barriers that were impeding effective management of it programs throughout the federal government .
among other provisions , fitara required the federal cio , in conjunction with federal agencies , to refocus the federal data center consolidation initiative ( fdcci ) to include adoption of cloud services .
as congress monitors the progress of federal departments and agencies in implementing cloud computing , its options for ongoing oversight include holding hearings ; requesting review of an agency's status by either the agency itself or the gao ; and assessing the agency's progress and projected goals against the stated goals of the cloud smart strategy .
in the plan , the federal cio recognized that too many past federal it projects had run over budget , fallen behind schedule , or failed to deliver promised functionality .
this section summarizes cloud - related legislation and hearings in the 116 th congress .
as plans to migrate to cloud services within the federal government are created and implemented , policymakers may choose to monitor how agencies are following federal directives and responding to gao assessments .
planning for cloud adoption by federal agencies began with the 2010 publication by the federal chief information officer ( cio ) of "a 25-point implementation plan to reform federal it management. .
such ambiguity can create uncertainties that may impede innovation and adoption .
in the 2017 "report to the president on federal it modernization," the office of management and budget ( omb ) pledged to update the federal government's legacy federal cloud computing strategy ( "cloud first" ) .
