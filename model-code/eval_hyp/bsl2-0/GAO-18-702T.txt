specifically , this testimony addresses ( 1 ) irs's efforts to address its authentication challenges , ( 2 ) irs's progress in implementing its authentication strategy , and ( 3 ) additional steps we identified that irs could take to enhance its authentication programs and stay ahead of fraudsters .
we compared irs's authentication efforts to applicable activities in the irs identity assurance strategy and roadmap ( roadmap ) , standards for internal control in the federal government , and relevant national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) guidance , among others .
in fiscal year 2017 , irs issued approximately $383 billion in individual tax refunds , including overpayment refunds and refundable tax credits , an increase of about $16 billion from the previous fiscal year .
we also compared irs's authentication programs and plans for future improvements to its roadmap , federal internal controls , guidance from nist and the office of management and budget ( omb ) , principles for project planning , and our prior work on information technology investment management and cost estimating .
irs's ability to continuously monitor its current authentication methods while also looking ahead to new identity verification technologies is critical to keeping ahead of fraudsters , who constantly adapt their schemes to thwart irs's defenses .
we also interviewed irs officials knowledgeable about the agency's taxpayer authentication programs , as well as irs , state , and industry co - leads from two security summit workgroups to understand irs's collaborative efforts to improve taxpayer authentication .
according to irs's most recent data , it estimates that in 2016 , at least $12.2 billion in idt tax refund fraud was attempted ; of this amount , at least $1.6 billion was paid out to fraudsters .
to conduct the work for our june report , we reviewed irs documents and information related to taxpayer authentication including authentication policies , risk assessments , and performance metrics .
to assess how irs can improve its authentication programs going forward , we met with knowledgeable officials from nist to discuss its guidelines for online identity - proofing and authentication .
in an environment with an increasing risk of fraud , identity theft ( idt ) , and cyberattacks , irs must ensure that its preventative security controls provide the agency with reasonable assurance that it is interacting with the legitimate taxpayer .
further , we found that irs does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement nist's new guidance for secure online authentication and also lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies , which could provide taxpayers additional options to actively protect their identity .
the agency must also strike a balance in designing its authentication programs .
my remarks today highlight selected findings of our june 2018 report on irs's efforts monitor and improve taxpayer authentication .
in brief , madam chairman , our work found that irs has taken some steps to improve taxpayer authentication , including working with external partners to identify solutions for combating idt refund fraud and developing an authentication strategy to address its most pressing authentication challenges .
authentication must be strong enough to prevent fraudsters from gaining access to irs services using stolen personally identifiable information , without being overly burdensome on legitimate taxpayers who also must authenticate .
