the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) has often been described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 .
this change reflects the spread of the new influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus , not its severity .
although currently the pandemic is of moderate severity with the majority of patients experiencing mild symptoms and making a rapid and full recovery , this experience could change .
it provides broad nondiscrimination protection in employment , public services , public accommodation and services operated by private entities , transportation , and telecommunications for individuals with disabilities .
on june 11 , 2009 , in response to the global spread of a new strain of influenza , the world health organization ( who ) raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6 , which indicates the start of an actual pandemic .
as stated in the act , the ada's purpose is "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. .
the application of the ada to an influenza pandemic is uncharted territory since the most recent previous influenza pandemic was in 1969 , before the 1990 enactment of the ada , and before the 1973 enactment of section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 , which was the model for the ada .
the ada limits an employer's ability to make disability - related inquiries or to require medical examinations .
however , such inquiries may be made if public health officials find that the illness caused by the pandemic is generally severe .
prior to an offer of employment , all disability - related inquiries and medical examinations are prohibited .
the eeoc technical assistance document regarding workplace pandemic preparedness and the ada discusses disability - related inquiries in the context of a pandemic , noting that "asking an individual about symptoms of a cold or the seasonal flu is not likely to elicit information about a disability. .
the term employer is defined as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees .
if an inquiry is not about a disability or likely to elicit information about a disability , the ada's prohibition on disability - related inquiries does not apply .
an inquiry that seeks to determine if an individual would be in a high - risk group for pandemic influenza due to a chronic health condition like asthma would not be permitted prior to a pandemic .
similarly , such an inquiry would not be permitted during a pandemic where the illness , as is currently the case , is generally moderate or mild .
title i of the ada prohibits employment discrimination , and specifically provides that no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures ; the hiring , advancement , or discharge of employees ; employee compensation ; job training ; and other terms , conditions , and privileges of employment .
currently , the h1n1 influenza virus is not seen as posing such a threat .
after a conditional job offer , but prior to the commencement of employment , an employer may make disability - related inquiries and conduct medical examinations as long as this is done for all entering employees in the same job category .
