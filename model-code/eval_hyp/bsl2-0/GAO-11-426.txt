the department of veterans affairs ( va ) received appropriations of about $48.2 billion for health care services for fiscal year 2011 .
although va networks retain responsibility for resource allocation decision making , va headquarters retains overall responsibility for oversight and management of va's resources .
each year , va allocates most of the appropriations for health care services to its 21 health care networks through a national , formula - driven system , called the veterans equitable resource allocation ( vera ) .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) va's new process for networks to use in determining allocations to medical centers , and ( 2 ) how va centrally monitors resources networks have allocated to medical centers .
you expressed interest in how va networks allocate resources to medical centers and how va oversees these resources once they are allocated .
through fiscal year 2010 , va headquarters permitted networks to develop their own methodologies for allocating resources to medical centers , and these methodologies varied considerably among the 21 networks .
in fiscal year 2010 , nearly 6 million patients received care through 153 va medical centers across the 21 networks .
the decentralized structure of the va health care system was set up to allow networks to respond to local health care needs , such as changing demographics of the veteran population in their regions , and increasing demand for ambulatory care .
concerned that network methodologies for allocating resources to medical centers were not fully transparent to va headquarters , va developed and implemented a new process in fiscal year 2011 for all networks to use in determining their allocations to medical centers .
such possibilities could place va's stewardship of federal dollars at risk .
to describe va's new process for allocating resources from networks to medical centers in fiscal year 2011 , we reviewed va documents describing the process and interviewed va officials from the veterans health administration's office of finance and office of operations and management about the process .
for example , va headquarters is ultimately responsible for ensuring that networks and medical centers do not spend more than the resources available to them .
the networks in turn allocate resources received through vera to their respective medical centers , as part of their role in overseeing all medical centers within their networks .
by documenting this information in a manner consistent with federal internal control standards , va would have greater assurance that the practices developed by the current leadership will be maintained during management changes over time .
however , without written policies to document its objectives for monitoring resources — including its existing practices — va cannot ensure that monitoring will be performed consistently and reliably .
for example , some networks' methodologies were based solely on the previous year's allocations for its medical centers with an adjustment for inflation , while some networks' methodologies determined allocations based on the patient workload of their medical centers .
to its credit , va has taken steps to increase the transparency for how networks allocate resources to medical centers , while maintaining network flexibility for allocation decisions .
in addition , va's current practices for monitoring help to ensure that network and medical center spending does not exceed allocations .
