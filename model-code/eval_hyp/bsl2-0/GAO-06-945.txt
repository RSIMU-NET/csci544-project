under flexibility provided by the act , the federal regulator — the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration ( phmsa ) — requires that operators reassess these pipeline segments for corrosion damage at least every 7 years in its implementing regulations , because corrosion is the most frequent cause of failures that can occur over time .
it also incorporated , as mandatory , voluntary industry consensus standards on maximum reassessment intervals into these regulations for other types of safety threats .
the 2002 act also requires that operators reassess these pipeline segments for safety threats at least every 7 years .
to do so , we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which findings from baseline assessments and other information inform us about the need to reassess gas transmission pipelines for safety risks at least every 7 years and ( 2 ) the ability of operators to obtain the services and tools needed to perform the reassessments .
pipeline segments that potentially face the greatest risks of failure from leaks or ruptures are to be assessed first .
to enhance the safety of gas transmission pipelines , the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 requires that operators of these pipelines develop programs to assess and mitigate safety threats , such as leaks or ruptures due to incorrect operation or corrosion , to pipeline segments that are located in highly populated and frequently used areas , such as parks .
the industry standards require that operators reassess gas pipelines at least every 10 , 15 , or 20 years for all safety risks , depending primarily on the condition of the pipelines and the pressure under which they operate .
we also examined the potential impact of periodic assessments on the nation's natural gas supply .
the 2002 act required that we assess the 7-year reassessment requirement .
 ( see app .
if conditions warrant , reassessments must occur more frequently .
specifically , operators are required to perform baseline assessments on one - half of the gas transmission pipeline mileage located in these areas by december 2007 and the remainder by december 2012 .
gas transmission pipelines are one of the nation's safest modes of freight transportation: nationwide about three people have died and about eight have been injured annually , on average , over the past decade because of natural gas pipeline incidents from all causes .
these two topics are the main focus of this report .
we discussed this issue with phmsa , other federal agencies , industry associations , companies that perform research in this area , state safety representatives , and safety advocacy groups .
we also obtained information from 52 gas pipeline operators for which baseline assessments and reassessments could have the greatest impact , all else being equal: larger and smaller transmission pipelines and local distribution companies ( pipeline companies that take gas from transmission pipelines and distribute it to end users ) with the highest proportion of pipeline miles in highly populated and frequently used areas to total system miles .
this report deals mostly with natural gas transmission pipelines , which represent the overwhelming majority of gas pipelines .
to understand how the findings from operators' baseline assessments and other information inform us about the need to reassess gas transmission pipelines at least every 7 years , we reviewed laws , regulations , and other phmsa guidance .
