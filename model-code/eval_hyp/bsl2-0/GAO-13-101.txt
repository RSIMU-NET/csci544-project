the act requires or authorizes various federal agencies to issue hundreds of regulations to implement its reforms .
in response to the crisis , congress passed the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) in 2010 , which includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of financial services firms and consolidate certain consumer protection responsibilities in the bureau of consumer financial protection , commonly known as the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) .
as agencies have turned their attention to implementing these requirements , some industry associations and others have raised concerns about the potential impact of the regulations , individually and cumulatively , on financial markets and financial and nonfinancial institutions .

three federal financial regulators issued 18 of the 19 major rules: the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) , commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
