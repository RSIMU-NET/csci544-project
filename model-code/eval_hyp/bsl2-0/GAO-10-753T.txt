however , rising costs and other federal budget priorities threaten to stall the initiative .
over the last 15 years , we have raised concerns about gsa's and the judiciary's process for planning new courthouses , including concerns over limited controls and oversight over courthouse construction costs .
since the early 1990s , the general services administration ( gsa ) and the federal judiciary ( judiciary ) have undertaken a multibillion - dollar courthouse construction initiative that has resulted in 66 new courthouses or annexes , with 29 additional projects in various stages of development .
furthermore , we and some members of congress have raised concerns that some courtrooms are underutilized ; that more courtrooms than needed have been , and continue to be , constructed ; and that increased courtroom sharing by judges — an option that the judiciary studied for district courtrooms in 2008 — could reduce the number of new courtrooms needed and therefore the size and cost of new courthouse projects .
we have also raised questions about the accuracy of the judiciary's long - term caseload projections — projections used to estimate the number of judges that will be located in new courthouses in 10 years , often under a policy that provided one courtroom for each estimated judge .
today , my testimony will provide , for the 33 federal courthouses completed since 2000 , preliminary results of our review of: ( 1 ) whether the courthouses contain extra space and any costs related to it , ( 2 ) how the actual size of the courthouses compares with the congressionally authorized size , ( 3 ) how courthouse space based on the judiciary's 10-year estimates of judges compares with the actual number of judges , and ( 4 ) whether the level of courtroom sharing supported by data from the judiciary's 2008 study of district courtroom sharing could have changed the amount of space needed in these courthouses .
as a result of this study , the judiciary recently established some new policies that incorporate more sharing of courtrooms for senior judges and magistrate judges .
to address these objectives , we analyzed planning , construction , and budget documents associated with all 33 federal courthouses or major annexes completed from 2000 through march 2010 .
to estimate the cost of any extra courthouse space , we added together any extra square footage we found through our analysis in objectives ( 2 ) through ( 4 ) .
my statement is based on a draft report that is currently out for agency comment and scheduled to be released in june 2010 .
in addition , we selected seven of the federal courthouses in our scope to analyze more closely as case studies .
 ( see table 5 in appendix i. ) .
it has been 20 years since congress passed comprehensive judgeship legislation .
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on the preliminary findings from our work related to the federal courthouse construction program .
to determine how the size of courthouses compares with the authorized size , we compared each courthouse's congressionally authorized gross square footage with the gross square footage of the courthouse as measured by gsa's space measurement program .
