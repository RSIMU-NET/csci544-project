researchers have primarily focused on medicare spending because of the availability of medicare spending data .
while researchers have developed a substantial body of work on geographic variation in medicare spending , less research has been done on geographic variation in private sector health care spending .
however , private sector spending on health care accounts for about one - third of u.s. health expenditures and more comprehensive private sector data has become available in recent years .
as u.s. health expenditures continue to rise , there is widespread interest among policymakers and others in improving their understanding of drivers of spending and in learning more about where and how health care systems operate efficiently — that is , provide equivalent or higher quality care while maintaining or lowering current spending levels .
national health expenditures are projected to grow from $2.8 trillion in 2012 to over $5 trillion in 2023 , outpacing gross domestic product ( gdp ) growth over this period , and accounting for almost 20 percent of gdp by 2023 .
the united states spends significantly more on health care than any other nation , yet health outcomes in the united states are not necessarily better than those of other nations with lower spending .
further , research on u.s. health care spending has shown that spending can vary by geographic area and that this variation remains even after accounting for important differences across areas , such as differing health status of populations and differing costs of doing business .
additional research on private sector spending will provide important contributions to an overall understanding of geographic variation in health care spending .
studies have also shown that higher spending is not always associated with better quality of care .
the reasons for higher or lower spending in certain areas may provide insights into the policy options that are most likely to be effective at promoting efficiencies and cost savings .
a useful framework for exploring geographic variation and reasons behind geographic spending differences is examining spending within an episode of care — defined as the care and services provided for a specific medical problem , condition , or illness during a specific time period .
episode spending by metropolitan statistical areas ( msa ) .
finally , 2009 and 2010 data do not reflect the impact of more recent policy or other changes potentially affecting private sector health care spending , such as the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act .
you asked us to examine geographic variation in private sector health care spending .
these components include the mix of services provided — hospital inpatient , hospital outpatient , physician and other professional services , postdischarge , and ancillary services — and the volume , intensity , and price of those services .
we examined how spending per episode of care for certain high - cost procedures varies across geographic areas for private payers and how the mix of service types , and the volume , intensity , and price of services contribute to variation in episode spending across geographic areas for private payers .
we analyzed the mix of service types by assigning all spending within an episode to one of five service categories: ( 1 ) hospital inpatient , ( 2 ) hospital outpatient , ( 3 ) postdischarge , ( 4 ) professional , and ( 5 ) ancillary .
