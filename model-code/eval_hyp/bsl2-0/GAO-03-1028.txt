as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to evaluate ( 1 ) departmental capabilities for managing the agency's information technology ( it ) investments , including its ability to effectively oversee bureau processes , and ( 2 ) the department's actions and plans to improve these capabilities .
to fulfill these responsibilities , interior invests over $850 million annually — about 6 percent of its total annual budgetary resources — in communications and computing projects and systems .
the secretary of the interior and interior's chief information officer ( cio ) are responsible for overseeing processes for managing these investments at all levels of the organization to ensure that funds are expended in the most cost - effective way in support of the agency's mission needs .
the department of the interior is responsible for diverse and complex missions ranging from managing america's public lands , mineral and water resources , and wildlife to providing satellite data to the military and scientific communities .
this report is one of two in response to your request that we evaluate the department of the interior's information technology investment management capabilities .
however , efforts to implement the reform initiatives have not moved forward as specified in implementing memoranda .
these critical processes are defined by key practices that include organizational commitments ( e.g. , policies and procedures ) , prerequisites ( e.g. , resource allocation ) , and activities ( e.g. , implementing procedures ) .
in august 2002 , interior's oig reported that the department did not have a process to ensure that it capital investments or projects focused on departmental mission objectives or federal government goals and initiatives — principally because of its decentralized approach to it investment management .
among other things , we recommended that blm take steps to strengthen its it investment management processes and systems acquisition capabilities .
therefore , about $1 billion in interior it investment projects were not subject to department - level review and approval during those 2 years .
the oig further stated that only 20 investment projects — representing over 24 percent of the total — were subject to departmental review and approval in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 through submission of capital asset plans .
among other things , we recommended that interior take steps to strengthen its software development and acquisition processes and that it regularly assess the progress being made in implementing this system .
we also reported that , as a result of poor planning , interior could not ensure that the system would meet financial management needs cost effectively or mitigate system development risks adequately .
between 1995 and 2001 , we reported on interior's efforts to acquire a land and mineral case processing system called automated land and mineral record system ( almrs ) / modernization and raised concerns about the bureau of land management's ( blm ) and the prime contractor's abilities to complete , integrate , and test the new software system and complete the current schedule .
in the presidentís fiscal year 2004 budget , omb reported that interior had made significant strides toward more fully identifying its it investments and strengthening the business cases that it developed for major it projects , although 20 of its 35 initial submissions remained on omb's at - risk list .
