we analyzed ( 1 ) the current state of the combat readiness of personnel , training , and equipment in these divisions and ( 2 ) the effect of peacekeeping missions on that readiness .
in july 2001 , we reported our initial observations on personnel readiness issues for these forces , particularly , the progress in achieving the goals of the army chief of staff's manning initiative of october 1999 .
this initiative was designed to ensure that all active army units are assigned 100 percent of enlisted personnel in terms of the authorized numbers , grades , and skills needed to perform wartime missions .
in 1998 we testified that personnel shortages , assignment priorities , and frequent peacekeeping deployments were degrading the combat readiness of the army's five later - deploying divisions .
since that report , terrorists attacked the world trade center and the pentagon , and the bush administration formulated a new military strategy .
this report , which was largely completed prior to the events of september 11 , 2001 , focuses on the other unit - readiness issues you requested that we review .
these developments may change how , when , and where these divisions will be used â€” as evidenced by the deployment of soldiers from the 10th infantry division in operation enduring freedom .
in october 2000 , you requested that we follow up our 1998 testimony to examine a number of issues associated with the readiness of the five divisions that had been considered later - deploying .
training also improved , which army officials attributed to ( 1 ) the increase in the number of personnel , prompted by the manning initiative , and ( 2 ) the implementation of a new funding policy for fiscal year 2001 that restricted the use of training funds to pay for other expenses .
in at least some cases , the redistribution of existing soldiers would fill these staffing shortages .
shortages were attributed to outdated authorizations and the incomplete fielding of new equipment ; according to the army's readiness reports , equipment shortages generally did not degrade readiness .
however , the army could not show specifically how the new funding policy improved training or unit readiness .
equipment maintenance problems were primarily attributed to the shortage of personnel with specific repair skills and the difficulties associated with maintaining old equipment .
in terms of the amount of equipment on hand and its serviceability , readiness was high during fiscal year 2001 , although some items were in short supply and some equipment difficult to maintain .
though manning has improved significantly over the past 2 years , divisions still have shortages in certain combat support skills that army commanders consider critical to their wartime mission .
these imbalances continue to result in manning shortfalls in some occupational specialties deemed critical to readiness by commanders .
to address staffing imbalances for occupational specialties common to all its divisions , we recommend that the secretary of the army develop and implement a plan to address those imbalances in making staffing decisions affecting the divisions and monitor the army's progress in alleviating the imbalances .
throughout january to june 2001 , these units reported their overall combat readiness and their readiness in personnel , training , and equipment to be at high levels .
