additionally , the strategic plan's success was linked to enactment of the president's fiscal year 2003 budget , legislation to change uspto's current fee schedule , revisions to current rules , and legislation for streamlining the patent and trademark system .
the administration released its fee legislation proposal on june 20 , 2002 .
this plan included nine operating initiatives focused on improving patent timeliness and quality .
expressing concern about uspto's plans for the future , the congress directed uspto in november 2001 to develop a 5-year plan , among other things , to improve patent quality and reduce patent and trademark pendency .
in this context , you asked for information on ( 1 ) uspto's past and future operations , particularly patent applications filed , patents granted , patent application inventory , patent pendency , patent examiner staffing , and fee collections and funding requirements ( agency appropriations ) ; ( 2 ) some of the differences between uspto's business and strategic plans ; and ( 3 ) changes in the patent fee structure under proposed legislation .
in february 2002 , uspto issued its first 5-year plan , which was called the uspto business plan and covered fiscal years 2003 through 2007 .
the plan also identified changes to the fee structure , including a one - time surcharge on patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2003 to begin paying for the new initiatives .
historically , the time from the date that a patent application is filed to the date that either the patent is granted or the application is abandoned has been called “patent pendency.” in april 2001 , uspto estimated in its fiscal year 2002 corporate plan — which was part of the agency's fiscal year 2002 budget submission and included some performance information covering fiscal years 2002 through 2006 — that patent pendency would increase from 25 months in fiscal year 2000 to over 38 months in fiscal year 2006 .
however , the strategic plan used different assumptions than the business plan about some key factors , such as the expected number of patent applications to be filed , and included major operating and fee changes that were more aggressive than those in the business plan .
like the business plan , it covered fiscal years 2003 through 2007 .
for example , the plan included hiring hundreds of new patent examiners each year to handle new patent applications .
the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , which administers u.s. patent and trademark laws , had a staff of 6,426 and collected about $1.1 billion in patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2001 .
as the u.s. economy depends increasingly on new innovations , the need to patent or trademark quickly the intellectual property resulting from such innovations becomes more important .
the business plan was developed before the new under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the united states patent and trademark office ( hereafter referred to as the director ) assumed office in december 2001 .
according to uspto , the strategic plan proposed fundamental changes in the way the agency operates , such as restructuring the patent fee schedule and redesigning the patent search and examination system .
