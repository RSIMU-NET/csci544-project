in this connection , you also asked us to provide you with information concerning doe's overall contracting and management initiatives and how they may resolve any problems identified at fernald .

doe can demonstrate the effectiveness of its incentive mechanisms and contract performance criteria and measures , its commitment to a policy of full and open competition , and the effects of its training of doe personnel in performance - based contracting .
although doe has already taken some actions to respond to the findings of recent reviews , some problems still remain unaddressed or need further action .
the contract's expiration also will provide a test of the implementation of doe's contract reform initiatives .
at fernald , weaknesses existed in doe's management and oversight of the cleanup projects we reviewed , in doe's development of a safety and health oversight program , and in the contractor's implementation of procedures for key financial and performance systems .

the expiration of doe's current contract with fluor daniel fernald provides an opportune time for doe to strengthen the specific oversight weaknesses we identified .
in view of the approaching expiration of the contract with fluor daniel fernald , we recommend that the secretary of energy ensure that ( 1 ) the contract reform initiatives that doe has undertaken are fully integrated into the fernald contract and that ( 2 ) the area office strengthen its oversight at fernald in order to correct the project management , safety and health program , and performance and financial system weaknesses that we have identified .
