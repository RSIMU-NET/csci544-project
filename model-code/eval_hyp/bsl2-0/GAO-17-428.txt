dod joint doctrine projects that the continual introduction of high - tech equipment , combined with military force structure reductions , mission - specific force cap restrictions , and high operating tempo means that contract support will continue to be relied upon to augment military forces in most operations .
according to data from the federal procurement data system â€“ next generation , dod obligated more than $40 billion between fiscal years 2011 and 2015 within pacom's area of responsibility , including for contracts supporting deployed forces .
since 2010 , we have reported on challenges dod has experienced in managing ocs and made recommendations to strengthen its efforts in this area , including incorporating ocs into planning , ensuring accountability for contractor personnel , and properly vetting contractors and contractor employees .
a growing reliance on contractors to provide logistical , transportation , intelligence , and other support to the combatant command's missions in this region requires advanced planning , rapid response , flexible procedures , and integration of efforts .
for example , in march 2010 we recommended that dod incorporate the potential need for contractor support into plans for military operations and that it include assumptions about the use and role of contractors .
as part of that effort , pacom established a joint task force that provided aviation capabilities to enable delivery of relief supplies and executed ocs to provide logistical support to deployed u.s. forces .
dod describes the process of planning for and obtaining supplies , services , and construction from commercial sources in support of joint operations as operational contract support ( ocs ) .
most recently , in december 2015 we recommended that dod clarify guidance on contractor accountability and issue department - wide guidance on foreign vendor vetting .
a key element of department of defense ( dod ) military strategy since 2012 has been a rebalance of u.s presence and capabilities toward the asia - pacific region , u.s. pacific command's ( pacom ) area of responsibility .
dod generally concurred with these recommendations and , in response , has issued and updated dod and joint staff ocs guidance related to ocs roles and responsibilities , planning for ocs requirements , ensuring accountability of contractors authorized to accompany the force , and implementing ocs within the combatant commands' area of responsibility .
this report addresses the extent to which pacom has: ( 1 ) accounted for contractor personnel and has a process to vet foreign vendors in its area of responsibility , ( 2 ) established an organizational structure to manage and oversee ocs , and ( 3 ) integrated ocs into key planning documents .
u.s. military personnel have deployed to locations within this region , where they rely on a variety of contracted services to provide needed support to conduct military operations , including exercises , humanitarian responses , and contingency operations .
in february 2013 we recommended that the joint staff provide training for ocs planners and , in march 2015 , we recommended that dod revise existing guidance and the services issue service - wide guidance related to collecting ocs lessons learned .
one example that highlights the importance of ocs in the asia - pacific region is pacom's foreign humanitarian assistance efforts in response to the may 2015 earthquake in nepal .
