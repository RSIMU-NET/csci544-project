through hope vi , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) provides funds to rehabilitate or demolish public housing and replace it with housing that serves both the poor as well as the middle class .
hope vi is a public housing reform program .
in order to understand hope vi and its issues , it is important to first understand a brief history of the larger public housing program .
grantees have been provided sufficient funding to demolish over 100,000 units of public housing .
in terms of addressing severely distressed public housing , the program has largely met its original goal: to eliminate the worst severely distressed public housing .
despite the hope vi program's successes , there are several issues in the program that have led some to call for reforms to the program .
they include the slow expenditure of hope vi funds , the impact of hope vi on the original public housing residents , the cost - effectiveness of the program , and the loss of assisted housing stock .
the fy1999 hud appropriations bill ( p.l .
the new designs also generally connect the public housing developments with their surrounding communities , both functionally and aesthetically .
the majority of funds are awarded through revitalization grants ; funds have also been awarded through demolition grants ( until fy2004 ) and planning grants ( until fy1995 ) .
hope vi has been credited with a number of successes .

congress responded by providing $100 million ( p.l .
citing the slow expenditure of funds , concerns about cost - effectiveness , and that the program had effectively reached its goal of demolishing 100,000 units of distressed public housing , the former administration stated it was time to rethink whether hope vi is still necessary or effective .
qhwra codified four purposes for the program: improving the living environment for public housing residents of severely distressed public housing projects through the demolition , rehabilitation , reconfiguration , or replacement of obsolete public housing projects ( or portions thereof ) ; revitalizing sites ( including remaining public housing dwelling units ) on which such public housing projects are located and contributing to the improvement of the surrounding neighborhood ; providing housing that will avoid or decrease the concentration of very low - income families ; and building sustainable communities .
the bush administration requested no new funding for the hope vi program in each of his fy2004-fy2008 budget requests to congress .
the bush administration argued that even without new funding , the program would not end any time soon because so many projects are still in the pipeline , but that by not funding the program , hud would have time to throughly evaluate the program and consider alternatives .
hope vi grants are limited to severely distressed public housing developments .
 ( see table 1 for historical appropriations levels. ) .
each year , congress rejected the bush administration's request to eliminate funding for the program , but it contined funding at a level significantly less than the amout provided prior to fy2004 .
