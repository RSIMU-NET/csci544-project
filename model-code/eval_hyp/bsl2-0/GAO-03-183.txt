the medicare , medicaid , and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 ( bipa ) directed us to examine the adequacy of medicare payments for snfs and the extent to which medicare revenues contribute to snfs' financial viability .
according to this argument , when medicaid payments do not cover the costs of medicaid patients , higher payments are needed from medicare to offset current or anticipated financial difficulties .
these representatives are mainly concerned about medicaid , a joint federal - state program for certain low - income individuals .
this report addresses ( 1 ) the relationship between medicare snf payments and the costs of treating medicare patients in freestanding snfs , as well as the effect of medicare snf payments on the financial condition of these facilities , and ( 2 ) the relationship between medicare snf payments and the costs of treating patients in hospital - based snfs , as well as the factors that may account for cost differences between hospital - based and freestanding snfs .
growth in the number of services provided to an increasing number of patients resulted in medicare spending for snf care reaching $13 billion in 1997 .
to address these issues , we analyzed 1997 through 2000 snf medicare cost reports , which are the financial documents that facilities submit annually to receive payment from medicare .
some of these increases expired on october 1 , 2002 , and provider representatives have said that they should be restored due to payment shortfalls from other payers .
we supplemented the cost report data with admissions data from medicare claims , data on facility characteristics from the online survey certification and reporting system ( oscar ) maintained by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , and data on patient services from cms's nursing home minimum data set ( mds ) .
the congress subsequently modified the pps with several temporary payment increases .
with the implementation of the pps , providers stated that the payments were inadequate , threatening their financial viability and their ability to serve beneficiaries .
in response , the congress established in the balanced budget act of 1997 ( bba ) a snf prospective payment system ( pps ) under which snfs receive a fixed payment that covers almost all services provided during each day of a medicare - covered stay .
from the mid - 1980s through 1997 , medicare's spending for skilled nursing facility ( snf ) care rose at an average annual rate of 30 percent , making it one of the fastest growing components of the medicare program .
during this period , medicare paid snfs based on their reported costs of delivering care , subject to certain limits that were higher for hospital - based snfs than for freestanding snfs .
an across - the - board increase would go to all providers of medicare snf care , even those for which medicare's current payments already greatly exceed costs and which are not experiencing any financial difficulty .
 ( see app .
concerns about the financial conditions of some nursing homes have led to interest in using medicare payment policy to offset current or anticipated financial difficulties .
we did not verify these data , but we excluded a snf from our analysis if one or more of its reported data items likely represented data entry or other reporting errors .
