usaid has awarded $120 million for eaef and $60 million for taef to date .
conferees of the fiscal year 2012 consolidated appropriations act , public law 112-74 , requested that we examine the management and oversight of the funds .
usaid grant agreements with eaef and taef , as well as the authorizing legislation , require the funds to fulfill several requirements related to financial management and public reporting , among other things .
in this report , we examine ( 1 ) the status of eaef's and taef's investments , ( 2 ) eaef's and taef's progress in establishing key management structures to support their missions and operations , and ( 3 ) the extent to which eaef and taef have complied with the requirements of the usaid grant agreements .
usaid is responsible for monitoring the funds' activities .
in 2013 , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) signed grant agreements with the egyptian - american enterprise fund ( eaef ) and the tunisian - american enterprise the purpose of the funds is to promote the fund ( taef ) ( the funds ) .development of egyptian and tunisian private sectors through activities such as investments in small and medium - sized enterprises ( sme ) .
while both funds have demonstrated their commitment to ensuring that u.s. funds are not used for prohibited purposes , neither fund has incorporated vetting requirements for individuals and organizations into its corporate policies .
taking steps to address these remaining items would strengthen usaid oversight and the funds' compliance with the grant agreements , which will be particularly important as the funds' investments grow in number and size .
to examine eaef's and taef's progress in establishing key management structures to support their missions and operations , we reviewed fund documents , such as their statements of corporate policies and procedures ( corporate policies ) , reports to external parties , boards of directors meeting minutes , financial and personnel information , and organizational charts .
in addition , while both funds are hiring contractors to develop performance monitoring plans — for which both funds required an extension of the original submission deadline — neither fund has completed its performance monitoring plan .
further , eaef has not yet complied with the provisions in the grant agreement related to public communications , such as those requiring eaef to acknowledge the u.s. government's financial contribution .
however , they have not yet completed actions to further strengthen oversight and compliance in several areas .
in addition , usaid and the funds continue to take steps to improve oversight and compliance with the grant agreements .
each fund has an independent board of directors , led by a chairman .
we used an internal control evaluation tool developed in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ( coso ) as a framework for obtaining and analyzing information on the funds' progress in establishing key management structures .
although our analysis included gaining an understanding of eaef's and taef's actions related to establishing internal control mechanisms , we did not evaluate the implementation of internal control at the funds .
to examine the status of the funds' investments , we reviewed the funds' strategic planning documents and interviewed the eaef and taef chairmen and senior management .
