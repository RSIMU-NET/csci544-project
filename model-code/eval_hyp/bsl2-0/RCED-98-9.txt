dot's federal highway administration ( fhwa ) neither adopts the guide nor requires its use by states .
billions of dollars have been spent to construct these roads and highways , and preserving and maintaining them is estimated to cost billions of dollars more each year .
in 1995 , the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) estimated that the average annual cost to maintain overall highway conditions and performance for this system through the year 2013 to be $44.8 billion .
the national highway system encompasses about 155,000 miles of the nation's most important interstate , arterial , and major highways and freeways , which represents about 4 percent of the nation's approximately 4 million miles of public roads .
this report ( 1 ) describes the roles of fhwa and others in developing and updating the pavement design guide and ( 2 ) examines the use and potential of a computer analysis method known as the nonlinear 3 dimensional - finite element method ( 3d - fem ) for improving the design and analysis of highway pavement structures .
an american association of state highway officials road test conducted in 1959-60 to obtain pavement performance data showed — among other things — that heavy trucks cause more highway pavement damage than other vehicular traffic .
according to fhwa , one indication of this is the states' use of guides and standards developed by a number of standard - setting industry organizations , including aashto .
rather , fhwa — in its working relationship with states — requires that sound engineering and management principles and practices be used in the pavement design process .
on the basis of this test , the association developed an initial pavement design guide in 1961 , and it has been updated periodically since then .
fhwa is responsible for administering and overseeing various highway transportation programs , including the federal - aid highway program — which provides financial assistance to the states for improving the efficiency of highway and traffic operations .
fhwa relies on aashto to ( 1 ) provide technical guidance for the design , construction , and maintenance of highways and other transportation facilities ; ( 2 ) publish manuals , guides , and specifications regarding design , safety , maintenance , and materials ; and ( 3 ) conduct planning for highways , bridges , and other structures .
research on nonlinear 3d - fem and documented successes in its application suggest that this method could be an important tool for accurately ( 1 ) designing and analyzing new highway pavement structures and ( 2 ) analyzing the response of deteriorated pavement structures for rehabilitation .
nchrp has undertaken a 5-year effort to update the guide employing improved design approaches .
several highway departments and academic institutions have already used nonlinear 3d - fem for various structural analysis applications .
we believe it should be considered in nchrp's ongoing efforts to update aashto's current pavement design and analysis guide .
fhwa supports aashto's manuals , guides , and specifications , which the states can use in designing and analyzing federally funded highway projects .
to better assist states in designing safer , longer lasting , and more cost - effective new , reconstructed , and overlay highway pavement structures , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the administrator , fhwa , to ensure that nonlinear 3d - fem is considered in the current update of the pavement design guide .
