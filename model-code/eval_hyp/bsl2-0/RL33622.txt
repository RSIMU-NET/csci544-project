he delegated the job of promoting public and international health projects to current minister of public health josé ramón balaguer cabrera .
at the same time that he ceded power to raúl , fidel castro tapped six other high - ranking government officials on a provisional basis for key roles in health , education , and energy projects .
fidel also directed lage , as well as foreign minister felipe perez roque and central bank president francisco soberón valdés , to form a commission to manage and prioritize funds for health , education , and energy programs .
some observers had been questioning why raúl castro had not been seen in public , although his public role in greeting visiting venezuelan president hugo chávez on august 13 , 2006 , has appeared to put these questions to rest .
on education , he designated josé ramón machado ventura and esteban lazo hernández , both members of the political bureau ( politburo ) of the communist party and both vice presidents of the council of state .
although cuba has remained a hard - line communist state under fidel castro since the 1959 cuban revolution , fidel's announcement that he was temporarily ceding political power to his brother raúl could be the beginning of a political transition .
castro promised to fight for his health , and urged his supporters to be optimistic , but cautioned that they should "be prepared for any adverse news. .
as a result , in a proclamation signed by fidel , raúl castro became first secretary of the communist party , commander in chief of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) , and president of the council of state and government , top positions that fidel had held .
on july 31 , 2006 , president fidel castro provisionally ceded political power to his brother raúl "for several weeks" in order to recover from intestinal surgery .
on energy , he designated carlos lage , a vice president of the council of state and executive secretary of the council of ministers .
while there has been growing sentiment in congress over the past several years to ease sanctions on cuba , legislative efforts to make changes to the economic embargo have not been enacted .
president bush has threatened to veto several appropriations bills if they contained any provisions weakening cuba sanctions .
at this juncture , there is sparse information coming out of cuba about fidel castro's medical condition and whether he will be able to resume his role as head of the political system and the communist party .
on august 13 , 2006 , fidel's 80 th birthday , cuba's newspaper juventud rebelde published the first photographs of castro since his surgery , along with a message from castro indicating that his recovery would not be short .
some have advocated a policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted , while continuing efforts to support the cuban people .
most of the debate has centered on the wisdom of u.s. economic sanctions on cuba .
although cuba has undertaken some limited economic reforms in recent years , politically the country remains a hard - line communist state .
still others have called for a swift normalization of u.s. - cuban relations by lifting the u.s. embargo .
