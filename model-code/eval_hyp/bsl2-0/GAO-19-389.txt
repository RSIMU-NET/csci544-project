implementing effective fraud risk management processes can help ensure that federal programs fulfill their intended purpose , spend their funding effectively , and safeguard assets .
we examined these processes against the leading practices in a framework for managing fraud risks in federal programs ( fraud risk framework ) related to assessing fraud risks .
this report ( 1 ) describes the steps usda has reported taking since 2015 to reduce improper payment error rates in the school meals programs and ( 2 ) examines the extent to which usda has assessed areas of risk for fraud in the school meals programs .
the school meals programs are overseen by the food and nutrition service ( fns ) at the department of agriculture ( usda ) .
to address our first objective , we reviewed the results of the most recent access , participation , eligibility , and certification ( apec ) study — which usda uses to estimate improper payments in the school meals programs — published in may 2015 , as well as estimated improper payment error rates and actions aimed at reducing them reported in usda's agency financial reports from fiscal years 2015 through 2018 .
we have previously reported that fraud poses a significant risk to the integrity of federal programs and erodes public trust in government .
we analyzed usda guidance related to two key oversight processes — management evaluations and administrative reviews .
the fraud risk framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt .
in fiscal year 2018 , almost 30 million children participated in the national school lunch program , and over 14 million participated in the school breakfast program , with cash payments of $12.5 billion and $4.4 billion , respectively .
to address our second objective , we analyzed documentation related to usda's risk assessment processes , including the assessment of fraud risks .
in addition , we interviewed agency officials about efforts to reduce improper payment error rates and manage fraud risks .
through these programs , the federal government provides reimbursement to schools for meals that meet federal requirements , and students may be eligible to receive meals for free or at a reduced price .
we selected the leading practices within the assess component because the identification and assessment of fraud risks are an important step in determining whether usda's oversight practices identify and address areas at risk for fraud .
you asked us to review improper payment error rates and potential fraud in the school meals programs .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
a well - balanced and nutritional diet for school children is essential for their overall health and well - being and helps promote academic achievement .
a high improper payment error rate may suggest that a program may also be vulnerable to fraud , although it is important to note that fraud is one specific type of improper payment , and improper payment estimates are not intended to measure fraud in a particular program .
historically , the school meals programs have reported high improper payment error rates , as high as almost 16 percent for the national school lunch program and almost 23 percent for the school breakfast program over the past 4 years .
