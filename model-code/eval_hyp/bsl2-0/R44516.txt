budget caps may have limited overall r&d funding and may have required movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities .
some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the current federal deficit and debt .
as congress acted to complete the fy2017 appropriations process , it faced two overarching issues: the extent to which federal r&d investments could grow in the face of increased pressure on discretionary spending and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding .
moving funding between programs / accounts / agencies can be complex and difficult because the funding for different programs / accounts / agencies is often provided through different appropriations bills .
its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense , health , safety , the environment , and energy security ; advancing knowledge generally ; developing the scientific and engineering workforce ; and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .
these budgets are subjected to review , revision , and approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and become part of president obama's annual budget submission to congress .
congress plays a central role in defining the nation's r&d priorities as it makes decisions about the level and allocation of r&d funding â€” overall , within agencies , and for specific programs .
agency r&d budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process and may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to r&d or in accounts that include funding for non - r&d activities .
however , widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions about the prioritization of r&d , both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal r&d portfolio .
the u.s. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering r&d .
the federal r&d budget is then calculated by aggregating the r&d components of each federal agency .
most of the r&d funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites , shale gas extraction , and defenses against disease .
the 115 th congress continues to take an interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .
the federal r&d budget is an aggregation of the r&d components of each federal agency .
there is no single , centralized source of funds that is allocated to individual agencies .
this report begins with a discussion of the overall level of president obama's fy2017 r&d request , followed by analyses of the r&d funding request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency r&d initiatives .
