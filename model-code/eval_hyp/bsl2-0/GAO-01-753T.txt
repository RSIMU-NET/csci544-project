describe service contracting trends and the changing acquisition discuss the challenges confronting the government in acquiring services , highlight some efforts underway to address these challenges .
last year alone , the federal government acquired more than $87 billion in services — a 24- percent increase in real terms from fiscal year 1990 .
in particular , agencies are not clearly defining their requirements , fully considering alternative solutions , performing vigorous price analyses , and adequately overseeing contractor performance .
our work continues to show that some service procurements are not being done efficiently , putting taxpayer dollars at risk .
the amount being spent on services is growing substantially .
consequently , a key question we face in the government is whether we have today , or will have tomorrow , the ability to acquire and manage the procurement of increasingly sophisticated services the government needs .
federal agencies spend billions of tax dollars each year to buy services ranging from clerical support and consulting services , to information technology services such as network support , to the management and operation of government facilities , such as national laboratories .
further , it is becoming increasingly evident that agencies are at risk of not having enough of the right people with the right skills to manage service procurements .
the increasing significance of contracting for services has prompted — and rightfully so — a renewed emphasis by congress and the executive agencies to resolve long - standing problems with service contracts .
to do so , the government must face the twin challenges of improving its acquisition of services while simultaneously addressing human capital issues .
over the past decade , federal spending patterns changed , the federal workforce declined , and new contracting vehicles and techniques were introduced .
spending subsequently increased to about $204 billion in fiscal year 2000 .
expanding the use of performance - based contracting approaches and emphasizing strategic human capital planning are welcomed and positive steps , but sustained leadership and commitment will be required to ensure that these efforts mitigate the risks the government currently faces when contracting for services .
however , the government's long - standing difficulties with managing service contracts have not changed , and it is clear that agencies are not doing all they can to ensure that they are acquiring services that meet their needs in a cost - effective manner .
thank you for inviting me to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on the challenges confronting the government's acquisition of services .
this decline in federal contracting continued for most of the 1990s , reaching a low of about $187 billion in fiscal year 1999 .
as figure 1 shows , between fiscal year 1990 and fiscal year 2000 , purchases of supplies and equipment fell by about $25 billion , while purchases of services increased by $17 billion , or about 24 percent .
the growth in services has largely been driven by the government's increased purchases of two types of services: information technology services , which increased from $3.7 billion in fiscal year 1990 to about $13.4 billion in fiscal year 2000 ; and professional , administrative , and management support services , which rose from $12.3 billion in fiscal year 1990 to $21.1 billion in fiscal year 2000 .
