pursuant to that agreement , the united states pledged ( in 2015 ) to reduce ghg emissions by 26% - 28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels .
this pledge supplemented a previous obama administration commitment to reduce u.s. ghg emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 .
during the obama administration , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) promulgated standards for co 2 emissions from existing fossil - fuel - fired electric power plants .
epa cited section 111 ( d ) of the clean air act ( caa ) as the authority to issue its final rule .
recent international negotiations and domestic policy developments have generated attention to current and projected u.s. ghg emission levels .
in december 2015 , delegations from 195 nations , including the united states , adopted an agreement in paris that creates an international structure for nations to pledge to abate their ghg emissions , adapt to climate change , and cooperate to achieve these ends , including financial and other support .
whether the united states ultimately achieves the 2020 and 2025 targets will likely depend , to some degree , on ghg emission levels , particularly co 2 emissions , from electric power plants — one of the largest sources of u.s. emissions .
a question for policymakers is whether u.s. ghg emissions will remain at current levels , decrease to meet the 2020 and 2025 goals , or increase toward former ( or even higher ) levels .
u.s. greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emission levels , particularly from carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) , remain a topic of interest among policymakers and stakeholders .
an understanding of ghg emission source data and the underlying factors that affect emission levels might help inform the discussion among policymakers regarding ghg emission mitigation .
the rule , known as the clean power plan ( cpp ) , appeared in the federal register on october 23 , 2015 .
multiple factors — including economics , technology , and climate policies — will likely play a role in future ghg emission levels .
this report examines recent trends in u.s. ghg emissions , particularly co 2 emissions from electricity generation , and the factors that impact emission levels in that sector .
however , some recent reports indicate that president trump is expected to withdraw from the agreement .
in april , epa began its review of the cpp and related power plant rules and may consider various options to revise or repeal the rules .
at the date of this report , u.s. involvement in the paris agreement remains uncertain .
in addition , this report examines the degree to which cpp implementation ( or lack thereof ) may impact co 2 emission levels from electric power plants .
a number of states and other entities have challenged the rule , while other states and entities have intervened in support of the rule .
second , president trump issued an executive order on march 28 , 2017 , that directs epa to review the cpp ( and other rulemakings ) and "as soon as practicable , suspend , revise , or rescind the guidance , or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending , revising , or rescinding those rules. .
