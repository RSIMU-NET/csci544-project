tough choices will be required to reform programs and management activities to reduce costs and better link resources to results .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) , too , has encouraged agencies to improve government effectiveness by increasing their use of evidence and rigorous program evaluation in making budget , management , and policy decisions .
the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) aims to ensure that agencies use performance information in decision making and holds them accountable for achieving results and improving government performance .
in the absence of policy change , rapid growth in federal government debt will increasingly constrain budgetary flexibility and the ability to address current and future needs .
the reporting requirements of the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) were intended to provide both congressional and executive decision makers with more objective information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending .
the federal government faces a number of significant fiscal , management , and performance challenges .
although gpra helped improve the availability of agency performance information , in our previous surveys , about half of federal managers reported using performance data for decision making to a great or very great extent .
comprehensive program evaluations that examine the coverage and effectiveness of a cluster of federal programs and policies aimed at achieving similar outcomes could be key in coordinating and streamlining programs so as to reduce duplication and overlap .
gprama requires gao to evaluate the act's implementation at several junctures ; this report is one of a series responding to the mandate to assess its initial implementation by june 30 , 2013 .
our objectives were to identify 1. the extent to which federal agencies are using program evaluations in selected program management and policy making activities ; 2. factors , if any , that hinder agencies' use of evaluation in program management and policy making ; and 3. factors or strategies that facilitate evaluation use .
over the past 3 years , we have identified numerous areas of fragmentation , overlap , or duplication in federal programs and activities .
selected for their experience with evaluation , these agencies were the food and nutrition service ( fns ) at the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , the administration for children and families ( acf ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) at the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the employment and training administration ( eta ) and chief evaluation office ( ceo ) at the u.s. department of labor .
carefully designed evaluation of performance and results for clusters of related programs — adoption of common measures and direct assessment of their overlap — could reveal ways to streamline , consolidate , or better coordinate those programs .
the report addresses agencies' access to and use of evaluation studies — a particular form of program performance information — for decisions .
in addition , we interviewed omb staff and evaluation officials at five federal agencies on factors or strategies that have hindered or facilitated these agencies' use of evaluation results in decision making .
the program evaluation literature has identified different ways that program managers and policy makers can use evaluation results to ( 1 ) clarify understanding of how the program does or does not address a problem of interest , ( 2 ) make changes to improve the design or management of an existing program or policy , ( 3 ) support or change resource allocations within or across programs , ( 4 ) share promising practices or lessons learned with service providers or program partners , or ( 5 ) improve the quality of program or policy assessment .
