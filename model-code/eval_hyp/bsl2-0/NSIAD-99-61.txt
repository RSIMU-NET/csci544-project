in february 1998 , we reported that the department of defense ( dod ) did not have receipts for about 60 percent of its 21 million shipments to end users in fiscal year 1997 .
among the dod components , the navy was responsible for almost one - half of dod's 12.4 million unacknowledged receipts .
more specifically , we ( 1 ) identified the reported value and types of inventory in transit within and between storage and repair activities , vendors , and end users that were unaccounted for ( or lost ) and ( 2 ) assessed the navy's adherence to procedures for controlling such in - transit inventory .
as agreed with your offices , we reviewed selected aspects of the navy's management procedures for controlling items in transit .
this report is one in a series addressing defense inventory management as a high - risk area in the federal government because of vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , and abuse .
excess property that is in transit between the military services and disposal offices is the topic of a separate report we will issue later this year .
among the dod components , the navy was responsible for over one - third of dod's 21 million shipments and almost one - half of dod's 12.4 million unacknowledged receipts ( valued at $11.7 billion ) .
this inventory is vulnerable to theft or loss and could cause managers to implement inefficient , ineffective decisions and practices regarding purchases .
for example , as we reported in february 1998 , dod did not have receipts for about 60 percent of its 21 million shipments to end users in fiscal year 1997 .
dod is also required by the strom thurmond national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1999 to develop a comprehensive plan to ensure visibility over in - transit secondary items .
figure 1 does not include any unaccounted for shipments to end users .
these weaknesses lead to potential theft or undetected losses of items and demonstrate inefficient and ineffective logistics management practices such as potentially shipping or buying unnecessary inventory .
our review of 30,314 lost warehoused shipments ( representing 132,793 items worth $753 million ) at navicp philadelphia in fiscal year 1997 showed that over 8,000 shipments contained military technology that needed to be protected .
because the act calls for us to review the dod plan and implementation , we will continue to monitor dod's efforts to develop its overall plan and be in a position to assess its implementation .
naval supply systems command and navicp philadelphia officials pointed out that in - transit losses for high - dollar items have declined from $1.2 billion to $600 million over the past 3 fiscal years but acknowledged that in - transit inventory continues to be a primary concern .
further , significant problems exist in data reporting systems .
dod's plan calls for improving asset visibility in such areas as in - transit assets and sets up the goal to achieve 90-percent visibility over material by 2000 .
classified and sensitive items included aircraft - guided missile launchers , military night vision devices , and communications equipment .
the lack of adequate internal controls undermines the navy's ability to do its part in helping dod achieve a 90-percent visibility rate over inventories by 2000 and reduce inventories by 2003 .
