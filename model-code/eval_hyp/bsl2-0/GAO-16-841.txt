the global security environment will likely continue to require significant reliance on u.s. military forces to respond to a range of demands even as the department faces a period of budget constraints including across - the - board spending reductions through sequestration and force structure reductions .
as a complement to those reviews , this report ( 1 ) describes the factors that affect reported readiness levels and dod's efforts to manage the impact of continued deployments on readiness , and ( 2 ) assesses dod's implementation and oversight of department - wide readiness rebuilding efforts .
in addition , the 2015 national military strategy suggests that dod has consumed readiness as quickly as it has been generated for nearly a generation and that the department is taking action to better balance achieving immediate operational goals with improving readiness for potential future contingencies .
the high pace of operations has created challenges for the all - volunteer force in its ability to respond to current demands .
as a result , dod must ensure that the force is poised to meet a range of global needs .
the house report accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act for 2016 included a provision for gao to submit a report to the congressional defense committees that provides a comprehensive , independent assessment of dod's efforts to rebuild readiness .
we briefed your staff on our work on the services' efforts to rebuild readiness in february 2016 and march 2016 and issued three related service - specific , classified reports in may 2016 .
to assess dod's implementation and oversight of department - wide readiness rebuilding efforts , we reviewed dod's plans for managing rebuilding efforts .
the house report also included a provision that gao assess the plans of the departments of the army , air force , and navy to rebuild readiness .
consequently , dod has made rebuilding the readiness of the military force one of the department's priorities and has outlined this priority in a key strategic guidance document .
specifically , the guidance for the employment of the force states that it is an overarching priority of the department to recover service readiness to preserve the long - term health of the force .
key elements include ( 1 ) a mission statement ; ( 2 ) long - term goals ; ( 3 ) strategies to achieve goals ; ( 4 ) external factors that could affect goals ; ( 5 ) metrics to gauge progress ; and ( 6 ) evaluations of the plan to monitor goals and objectives .
the fundamental purpose of the military is to fight and win our nation's conflicts , and the department of defense ( dod ) has recognized the negative impact that more than a decade of deployments in support of counterinsurgency operations in iraq and afghanistan has had on the readiness of the force .
therefore , this report omits secret information and data such as readiness trend data , deployment data , and selected details of the services' readiness recovery plans .
we concluded that both sets of data were sufficiently reliable for reporting current and historical readiness trends and global demand reform efforts .
dod deemed some of the information in the prior report as secret , which must be protected from public disclosure .
