1. ) .
notably , our work on epa's integrated risk information system ( iris ) program and its database — which contains the agency's scientific position on the potential human health effects of exposure to more than 540 chemicals — identified significant concerns about both the lack of transparency in the process epa uses to assess toxic chemicals and the resulting effect on the credibility , or integrity , of these assessments .
the consequences of these transparency and credibility issues are considerable because iris assessments are the cornerstone of scientifically sound environmental decisions , policies , and regulations .
since 2001 , we have issued a number of reports underscoring the importance of integrity and transparency in processes that ( 1 ) develop the science used to inform policy decisions and ( 2 ) are used to establish federal advisory committees that , among other things , provide independent peer reviews of epa's scientific determinations .
epa's ability to effectively carry out its mission to protect human health and the environment is critically dependent on timely and credible scientific and technical information and health risk assessments .
the 24 federal advisory committees epa has established can be important vehicles for such peer review .
this process , in turn , provides the foundation for risk management decisions , such as determining whether epa should establish controls for particular substances to protect the public under such environmental laws as the clean air act and the safe drinking water act .
 ( see fig .
epa also seeks to enhance the quality and credibility of its highly specialized scientific and technical products by using independent , expert peer reviews .
because the work of fully competent peer review panels can be undermined by allegations of conflict of interest and bias , the best interests of federal advisory committees are served by effective policies and procedures regarding potential conflicts of interest , impartiality , and overall committee balance .
for example , the epa science advisory board convenes panels to review many of the agency's scientific assessments and proposals .
in this context , my testimony today discusses scientific integrity and transparency issues and , where applicable , epa reforms of the iris assessment program and federal advisory committee policies and procedures .
that is , the toxicity assessments in iris constitute the first two critical steps of the risk assessment process .
our preliminary analysis of iris reforms focuses primarily on issues related to scientific integrity and transparency and does not include iris productivity issues .
we have supplemented this testimony with a preliminary review of epa's may 21 , 2009 , revisions to the iris assessment process and of the current appointment mechanisms for epa's 24 federal advisory committees .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the importance of scientific integrity and transparency at the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
my statement is based on findings from a number of reports and testimonies we have issued since 2001 involving scientific integrity and transparency issues at epa .
we conducted our work from may 26 to june 9 , 2009 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
these factors include ( 1 ) the office of management and budget's ( omb ) requiring two additional reviews of iris assessments by omb and other federal agencies with an interest in the assessments , such as the department of defense , and ( 2 ) epa management decisions , such as delaying some assessments to await the results of new research .
