an economic recession started in december 2007 , and while the reauthorization of tanf through the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) did not make legislative changes to tribal tanf , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) established the emergency contingency fund that tribes as well as states could access for additional funding .
as congress looks toward potentially reauthorizing the tanf program in 2012 , you asked us to address ( 1 ) how tribal tanf programs have changed since 2002 , especially in light of changing economic conditions ; ( 2 ) the challenges tribes face in administering their own tanf programs and what tribes have done to address them ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) has provided guidance and oversight to promote the integrity and effectiveness of tribal tanf programs .
since 2002 , when we first reported on the status of tribal tanf programs , changes in economic conditions and recent legislation have affected these programs .
these changes have raised questions about how tribal tanf programs have evolved over time and what the role of federal agencies is in assisting and overseeing them .
prwora gives tribal tanf programs broad flexibility in designing their programs and tailoring them to meet tanf requirements and address their families' needs .
to address these issues , we analyzed hhs tribal tanf work participation , expenditure , and caseload data for fiscal years 2002 to 2009 .
overall , the tanf block grant program provides approximately $17 billion annually to assist low - income families and improve employment and other outcomes , of which it provides about $182 million specifically to tribal tanf programs .
our review also included all 64 tribal tanf plans approved by hhs as of october 2010 .
in the united states , american indians disproportionately experience socioeconomic challenges , including high rates of poverty and unemployment .
we also reviewed tribes' applications for the recovery act's emergency contingency fund , and data on tribes' expenditures of these funds .
those living on or near reservations often face additional challenges because many of these communities are isolated .
the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) brought about significant reforms to the country's welfare system when it replaced the aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program with the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant .
in addition , we reviewed all tribal tanf office of management and budget ( omb ) circular no .
as part of these reforms , federally recognized american indian tribes were given the option to administer their own tribal tanf programs either individually or as part of a consortium , providing benefits and services to american indian families , who previously were served by state afdc programs .
in 2008 , the u.s. census bureau reported that american indians throughout the nation were almost twice as likely to live in poverty as the rest of the population â€” 27 percent compared to 15 percent .
tanf has a maintenance - of - effort ( moe ) provision that requires states to maintain a significant portion of their historic financial commitment to their welfare programs .
