savings generated by the disposal of unneeded properties might be applied to pressing real property needs , such as improving building security or repairing existing facilities , or towards other pressing policy issues , such as reducing the national debt .
healthcare provided by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , for example , has shifted in recent decades from predominately hospital - based inpatient care to a greater reliance on clinics and outpatient care , with a resulting change in space needs .
as agencies' missions change over time , so , too , do their real property needs , thereby rendering some assets less useful or unneeded altogether .
similarly , the department of defense ( dod ) reduced its force structure by 36% after the cold war ended , and has engaged in several rounds of base realignments and installation closures .
these assets have been acquired over a period of decades to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions .
in fy2013 , for example , the government disposed of 21,464 unneeded properties with annual operating costs of $411 million .
disposition is also important because it is a mechanism by which state and local governments , nonprofit organizations , and businesses may acquire federal property .
in the hands of nonfederal entities , the previously underutilized properties may be used to provide services to the public , such as temporary housing , or contribute to economic development .
federal executive branch agencies hold an extensive real property portfolio that includes more than 871,000 buildings and structures , and 40 million acres of land worldwide .
disposition is an important asset - management function because the costs of maintaining unneeded properties can be substantial .
this report begins with an explanation of the central role played by the general services administration ( gsa ) in the disposal of federal real property at most agencies .
postal service ( usps ) , which each have independent statutory authority to dispose of their own properties .
agencies hold properties with a range of uses , including barracks , health clinics , warehouses , laboratories , national parks , boat docks , and offices .
real property disposition is the process by which federal agencies identify and then transfer , donate , or sell facilities and land they no longer need .
it concludes with an overview of the environmental and historic preservation requirements that apply to the disposal of properties at all federal agencies .
it then provides a discussion of the unique disposal processes at dod and the u.s .
while usps has been given autonomy in disposing of all of its properties , dod's disposal authorities are more limited and more complicated .
both dod and usps have independent statutory authority to dispose of unneeded real property , although the scope of that authority differs .
regulations implementing nepa were promulgated by the council on environmental quality ( ceq ) .
dod and usps are two of the three largest federal landholding agencies , as measured by owned square feet .
the federal real property and administrative services act of 1949 ( property act ) applies to real property held by most federal agencies .
dod is the largest , with more than 1.7 billion square feet of owned space in its inventory , while usps is the third largest with 197 million square feet of owned space .
