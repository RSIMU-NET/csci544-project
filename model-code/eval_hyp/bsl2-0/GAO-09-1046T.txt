state has also faced persistent shortages of staff with critical language skills , despite the importance of foreign language proficiency in advancing u.s. foreign policy and economic interests overseas .
i will discuss ( 1 ) state's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts , and ( 2 ) state's efforts to meet its foreign language requirements .
in recent years gao has issued a number of reports on human capital issues that have hampered state's ability to carry out the president's foreign policy objectives ( see appendix i for a complete list of related gao products ) .
in particular , state has long had difficulty staffing its hardship posts overseas , which are places like beirut and lagos , where conditions are difficult and sometimes dangerous due to harsh environmental and extreme living conditions that often entail pervasive crime or war , but are nonetheless integral to foreign policy priorities and need a full complement of qualified staff .
state has undertaken several initiatives to address these shortages , including multiple staffing increases intended to fill the gaps .
the department of state ( state ) faces an ongoing challenge of ensuring it has the right people , with the right skills , in the right places overseas to carry out the department's priorities .
however , the department has not undertaken these initiatives in a comprehensive and strategic manner .
a common element of these problems has been a longstanding staffing and experience deficit , which has both contributed to the gaps at hardship posts and fueled the language shortfall by limiting the number of staff available for language training .
to address these objectives in our two reports , we analyzed key planning documents and other data provided by state ; reviewed relevant reports by gao and other agencies and organizations ; and met with a number of state officials from various bureaus in washington and overseas .
i am pleased to be here to discuss u.s. diplomatic readiness , and in particular the staffing and foreign language challenges facing the foreign service .
my statement today is based on two gao reports that were released on september 22 .
in brief , mr. chairman , we found that , despite a number of steps taken over a number of years , the state department continues to face persistent staffing and experience gaps at hardship posts , as well as notable shortfalls in foreign language capabilities .
as a result , it is unclear when the staffing and skill gaps that put diplomatic readiness at risk will close .
in our recently - issued reports we made several recommendations to help state address its staffing gaps and language proficiency shortfalls .
to address state's long - standing foreign language proficiency shortfalls , we recommend that the secretary of state develop a comprehensive strategic plan with measurable goals , objectives , milestones , and feedback mechanisms that links all of state's efforts to meet its foreign language requirements .
to ensure that hardship posts are staffed commensurate with their stated level of strategic importance and resources are properly targeted , gao recommends the secretary of state ( 1 ) take steps to minimize the experience gap at hardship posts by making the assignment of experienced officers to such posts an explicit priority consideration , and ( 2 ) develop and implement a plan to evaluate incentives for hardship post assignments .
