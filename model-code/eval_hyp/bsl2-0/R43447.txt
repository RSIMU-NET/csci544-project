no such legislation has been enacted by congress to date .
several states have , for example , adopted measures barring unauthorized aliens from attending public institutions of higher education .
however , several states have passed their own dream acts , which permit some dreamers to receive in - state tuition or , less commonly , state financial aid ( but cannot provide a pathway to citizenship because congress has exclusive power over naturalization ) .
for example , in every congress from the 109 th to 113 th , members have introduced , either as separate bills or parts of other measures , versions of the development , relief , and education for alien minors ( dream ) act — from which dreamers take their name — that would create a pathway to citizenship for them , as well as remove certain restrictions on states' ability to grant in - state tuition to unauthorized aliens .
congress has also restricted unauthorized aliens' eligibility for "public benefits," a term which has generally been construed to include in - state tuition and financial aid .
others , however , emphasize dreamers' presence in the united states in violation of federal immigration law , and seek to ensure that public benefits are made available only to u.s. citizens , lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) , and nonimmigrants with legal status .
however , not all aliens commonly known as dreamers have been granted deferred action , and even those who have been granted deferred action are considered to be lawfully present only while they are in deferred action or other similar status .
certain states have also reiterated , or sought to expand upon , existing federal restrictions upon unauthorized aliens' receipt of public benefits in order to ensure that they do not receive in - state tuition or state financial aid .
emphasizing dreamers' ties to the united states , including their attendance at public elementary and secondary schools , some would permit them to remain in the united states legally , or expand their access to higher education .
this report surveys key legal issues pertaining to unauthorized alien students' access to higher education , in - state tuition , and financial aid .
the plyler court did not , however , purport to address unauthorized aliens' access to higher education , and several states subsequently adopted laws or practices barring their enrollment at public institutions of higher education .
the obama administration also began granting deferred action — a type of relief from removal — to qualifying dreamers in 2012 .
because aliens granted deferred action are generally viewed as "lawfully present" for purposes of federal immigration law , they could potentially be deemed eligible for certain educational benefits that are denied to aliens who are "unlawfully present. .
the term dreamer is widely used to describe aliens who were brought to the united states as children and raised here but lack legal immigration status .
t he existence of a sizable population of "dreamers" in the united states has prompted questions about unauthorized aliens' eligibility for admission to public institutions of higher education , in - state tuition , and financial aid .
