because of your interest in ensuring that federal training programs accommodate small employers , you asked that we ( 1 ) provide information on the extent to which small employers participate in employment training programs of different types , ( 2 ) identify barriers that may limit their participation , and ( 3 ) discuss ways to address such barriers .
generally , federal employment training programs target specific populations of workers , such as dislocated workers â€” those who have been or will be permanently laid off due to plant closures or corporate downsizing .
these programs often pay for formal training or other services workers need to find stable employment and , as a result , can reduce employers' training costs by providing them with trained workers .
in your september 18 , 1995 , letter , you expressed concern about the difficulties small employers may have in training their workforce or hiring additional workers with the necessary skills .
we reported in 1995 that the federal government alone spent about $20 billion on 163 programs that included some aspect of worker training .
to obtain information on small employer training activities , their use of available training programs , and barriers they may face when participatingin programs , we reviewed pertinent literature and studies ; interviewed many officials from employer and other associations and federal agencies ; and analyzed the most recent employer surveys of training by the university of pennsylvania's national center for the educational quality of the workforce ( eqw ) , the department of labor's bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , and the university of kentucky ( performed under a grant from the small business administration ( sba ) ) .
both government and the private sector currently devote significant resources to train our nation's workforce .
to obtain specific information about barriers faced by employers using particular programs , we conducted six case studies of small employer experiences in selected programs that offered formal training and had different funding sources , program goals , and operations .
these case studies included two organizations providing local services to dislocated workers under the federal job training partnership act's ( jtpa ) title iii economic dislocation and worker adjustment assistance ( edwaa ) program ( the north tennessee private industry council in clarksville , tennessee , and the private industry council in portland , oregon ) ; two state training fund programs ( the employment training panel in sacramento , california , and the office of customized training in trenton , new jersey ) ; and two privately funded and operated apprenticeship programs ( the tooling and manufacturing association in park ridge , illinois , and the employing bricklayers association of delaware valley in plymouth meeting , pennsylvania ) .
appendixes ii , iii , and iv discuss the results of these case studies .
we conducted our audit work between june 1995 and march 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
as reform of the federal employment training system continues to be debated , our work suggests that a greater role for or use of consortia or increased technical assistance provided to employers could make federal training programs more accessible to small employers .
we believe , however , that the qualitative information we collected provides important information on small employers' experiences as participants in selected training programs .
