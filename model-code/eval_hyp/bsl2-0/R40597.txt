substantial controversy is also continuing over the draft bill's renewable energy mandate on electricity suppliers .
several major issues are not addressed by the draft bill and are still under discussion , such as how to allocate emission allowances and how to assist workers and consumers affected by the cap - and - trade system .
the draft bill would require retail electricity suppliers to meet a certain percentage of their power load with electricity generated from renewable resources , starting at 6% in 2012 and gradually rising to 25% in 2025 .
if the president determined that competitive imbalances persisted despite those payments , foreign manufacturers and importers would have to purchase special allowances to cover the carbon emissions related to their imported products .
to address concerns that greenhouse gas controls could place u.s. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage , the draft bill authorizes compensation to certain industrial sectors .
covered entities would need permits ( called allowances ) to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , and unused allowances could be banked for future use or sold .
the number of allowances issued each year would be gradually reduced until greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities were cut 83% below 2005 levels in 2050 .
the proposed cap - and - trade system would cover electric utilities and other entities that together are responsible for 85% of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions .
the draft legislation , titled the american clean energy and security act of 2009 , proposes a "cap and trade" system to control carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have been associated with global climate change .
it is not designed to track the development and evolution of greenhouse gas legislation .
a discussion draft of broad legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was released march 31 , 2009 , by representative waxman , chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce , and representative markey , chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee .
the remainder of this report provides a brief summary of the provisions of the march 31 waxman - markey discussion draft .
the summary focuses on general descriptions of the discussion draft's provisions , excluding most details and analysis .

provides developing countries with assistance from the united states to encourage widespread deployment of technologies that reduce ghg emissions , and encourage developing countries to adopt policies and measures that will reduce ghg emissions .
states the policy of the united states is to achieve effective international agreements on climate change that require all major greenhouse gas - emitting nations to contribute equitably to reducing emissions .
