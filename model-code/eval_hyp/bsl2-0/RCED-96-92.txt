for extension activities , federal , state , and county governments allocated about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 1994 .
information on total funding for higher education to support the agricultural sector is not readily available ; however , usda allocated about $12.8 million for higher education in fiscal year 1994 .
in fiscal year 1992 ( the most recent year for which private sector data were available ) , agricultural research expenditures totaled about $6.3 billion .
the private sector spent about $3.8 billion on agricultural research — about 60 percent of the combined federal , state , and private expenditures for that year .
for over a century , productivity - enhancing agricultural research has been an important catalyst in creating a vigorous agricultural economy and a plentiful , low - cost supply of food and fiber .
together with extension and education , agricultural research has helped transform u.s. agriculture into a productive , technology - based operation .
agricultural research and extension historically have focused on increasing agricultural productivity and improving the economic well - being of a largely rural u.s. population .
the research component of the system , devoted to discovering new solutions for food - and agriculture - related problems , is carried out through several agencies in the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) — including over 100 usda laboratory locations ; 74 land grant colleges and universities ; other institutions of higher education ; and numerous private research facilities .
initially , research concentrated on ( 1 ) mechanical innovations for planting and harvesting that would remove much of the physical labor from farming and ( 2 ) improving the output and productivity of crop and animal production on farms .
while each of the three functions has its own purpose , they are interwoven and , hence , are often referred to jointly as the agricultural research , education , and extension system .
