within the federal government , the food and drug administration ( fda ) is responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's blood supply .
in recent years , an average of about 8 million volunteers have donated more than 14 million units of blood annually , and approximately 4.5 million patients per year have received life - saving blood transfusions , according to the american association of blood banks ( aabb ) .
however , because very few of the units donated immediately after september 11 were needed by the survivors , this experience has also raised concerns among blood suppliers and within the government about how best to manage and prepare the blood supply for emergencies .
about 90 percent of the u.s. blood supply is collected by two blood suppliers , the american national red cross and independent blood banks affiliated with america's blood centers ( abc ) .
the surge in donations after the terrorist attacks added an estimated 500,000 units to annual collections in 2001 .
today we are releasing a report that summarizes several issues regarding blood safety and availability .
the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , reminded the nation of the critical importance of a safe and adequate supply of blood for transfusions .
in brief , available data indicate that the blood supply has increased in the past 5 years and that it remains generally adequate .
our report also describes recent changes in the price of blood and evaluates the potential impact of the new guidance from fda that is aimed at reducing the risk of transmitting variant creutzfeldt - jakob disease , the human form of “mad cow” disease , through blood transfusions .
the experience illustrated that large numbers of americans are willing to donate blood in response to disasters .
although local and temporary blood shortages occur from time to time , the inventory of blood in america's hospitals was at historically high levels before september 11 and has generally remained adequate through the first 8 months of 2002 .
my comments will focus on three of the topics addressed in our report: the adequacy of the blood supply , the response of the blood suppliers to the september 11 attacks , and their planning for future emergencies .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to testify as the subcommittee considers the blood supply and its adequacy to meet the nation's emergency needs .
in the weeks immediately following september 11 , blood collections increased nearly 40 percent over collections earlier in 2001 .
blood collections increased 21 percent from 1997 to 2001 , and collections in the first half of 2002 appear to have been roughly equivalent to the same period in 2001 .
a task force including members from federal agencies and blood suppliers has been formed to coordinate the response in future emergencies to the need for blood .
there has been a corresponding rise in the number of transfusions from 1997 to 2001 .
the interorganizational task force organized by aabb has involved the blood community in efforts to more effectively plan for future disasters .
blood suppliers and the federal government have begun to reevaluate how blood is collected during and after disasters to avoid repeating this experience and also to ensure that enough blood is available during emergencies .
