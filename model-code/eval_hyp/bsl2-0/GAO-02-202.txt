more recently , the medicare , medicaid , and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 ( bipa ) increased m+c payments on march 1 , 2001 .
the medicare , medicaid , and schip balanced budget refinement act of 1999 ( bbra ) slowed the implementation of scheduled m+c payment reforms and established a new - entry bonus payment in areas where m+c plans were not being offered .
mcos could ( 1 ) improve their health plans' benefit packages , ( 2 ) set aside money for future years in a benefit stabilization fund , or ( 3 ) stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers .
concerned about the potentially disruptive effect of mco withdrawals from certain areas on medicare beneficiaries and the overall reduction in their health plan choices , congress has attempted to make participation in the m+c program more attractive to mcos .
for the typical m+c plan , medicare monthly , per enrollee payments increased by an average of $16 per member per month ( pmpm ) , although the increase was much higher for some plans and lower for others .
as a result of bipa , aggregate m+c payments in 2001 are estimated to have increased by nearly $1 billion .
these withdrawals are expected to affect approximately 536,000 of the 5.6 million beneficiaries currently enrolled in m+c plans .
although nearly all mcos renewed at least some of their medicare contracts over this period , many reduced the geographic areas served by one or more of their health plans.as a consequence of both the contract terminations and the service area reductions , approximately 1.6 million beneficiaries have had to switch mcos or return to medicare's traditional fee - for - service ( ffs ) program .
to conduct our study , we analyzed data maintained by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency that administers medicare , and interviewed agency officials responsible for implementing bipa's m+c payment provisions .
the reduction largely reflected the decisions of some managed care organizations ( mco ) to terminate selected contracts or to discontinue service in certain covered areas .
to assist in further congressional deliberations on m+c participation and payment issues , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) how mcos used the additional money authorized by bipa in 2001 and ( 2 ) the extent to which the availability of m+c plans changed after bipa .
when bipa was enacted , m+c contracts for the 2001 benefit year had already been approved and the benefit package established for each plan .
recently , more mcos have announced their intention to either terminate or reduce their participation in m+c at the end of 2001 .
we reviewed all mcos' initial ( pre - bipa ) and revised ( post - bipa ) 2001 contract proposals , which contained detailed information on their health plans' costs and covered benefits .
between 1998 and 2001 , the total number of contracts under medicare's managed care program , medicare+choice ( m+c ) , fell from approximately 340 to 180 .
therefore , the legislation required mcos to submit a revised contract proposal for each plan that explained how the payment increase would be used .
