for example , the united states department of agriculture is under no similar obligation to assist applicants in obtaining evidence of eligibility for supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) benefits ; the social security administration does not give "the benefit of the doubt" to applicants for social security benefits .
this duty to assist and the benefit of the doubt standard are unique among the federal government's benefits programs .
these requirements have the effect of making the va claims adjudication system "strongly and uniquely pro - claimant. .
these benefits include disability compensation and pensions , education benefits , survivor benefits , medical treatment , life insurance , vocational rehabilitation , and burial and memorial benefits .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides an array of benefits to veterans and to certain members of their families .
this report will analyze the va's duty to assist claimants and the pro - claimant standard of proof used during the adjudicatory process for veterans' benefits .
furthermore , the va , when adjudicating any claim for benefits , is obligated to give the claimant the "benefit of the doubt" when there is "an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding" any claim , and must also consider legal theories that a claimant fails to raise if it would help substantiate a claim for benefits .
in order to apply for these benefits , in most circumstances , the claimant will send an application to his or her local va regional office or apply online .
this duty includes obligations to ensure that a claimant's file is complete , to seek evidence and records substantiating the claim , and to provide medical examinations under certain circumstances .
the va has a "duty to assist" the claimant throughout the claim process .
the va is required to assist veterans by considering all possible legal theories that would support a claim , even if the veteran does not raise the particular issue in his application for benefits .
this requirement , again , is a unique feature of the va benefits system and illustrates the non - adversarial nature of benefits proceedings .
va regulations require the va to assist the claimant "in developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to render a decision that grants every benefit that can be supported in law while protecting the interests of the government. .
however , although courts have enforced the regulation to require the va to take into consideration legal theories not raised by a claimant that could be used to substantiate a claim , the courts do not require the va to consider every possible argument that a claimant presumably could make .
regulations provide that when reasonable doubt arises , such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant .
instead , the va is obligated only to consider legal theories that the claimant failed to argue if the record of evidence "fairly raise[s]" those issues .
this standard is generous to veterans but respects the reality that the secretary does not have the resources to investigate sua sponte every conceivable unsupported theory of entitlement .
the va must consider those arguments even if the claimant is unaware of the potential claim .
