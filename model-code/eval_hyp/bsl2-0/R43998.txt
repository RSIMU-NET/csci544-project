measures one through three below were reauthorized through crop year 2018 without change by the 2014 farm bill ( p.l .
the legislation also encouraged the president to impose duties , fees or quotas on foreign sugar to prevent domestic prices from moving below established support levels to avoid imposing budgetary costs on the government .
113-79 ) .
to achieve both objectives , usda uses four tools to keep domestic market prices above guaranteed levels .
the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) is directed to administer the program at no budgetary cost to the federal government by limiting the amount of sugar supplied for food use in the u.s. market .
in its report on the 1981 farm bill , the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition and forestry cited the importance of sugar imports to u.s. sugar supplies , pointing out that volatile world market prices of sugar contributed to sharp fluctuations in u.s. sugar prices , while adding that the united states was alone among sugar producing nations in being without an effective government price support program .
the sugar program has long been a source of political controversy over the degree of government support and market intervention it involves with sharply differing perspectives on the balance of benefits and drawbacks to the program .
the current sugar program has its roots in the agriculture and food act of 1981 ( p.l .
in addition to the foregoing policy tools , two agreements signed by the u.s. department of commerce ( doc ) in late 2014 — one with the government of mexico and another with mexican sugar producers and exporters — impose annual limits on mexican sugar exports to the united states and establish minimum prices for imported mexican sugar .
the four are: 1. price support loans at specified levels — the basis for the price guarantee ; 2. marketing allotments to limit the amount of sugar that each processor can sell ; 3. a sugar - to - ethanol ( feedstock flexibility ) backstop — available if marketing allotments and import quotas fail to prevent a price - depressing surplus of sugar from developing ( i.e. , fail to keep market prices above guaranteed levels ) ; 4. import quotas to control the amount of sugar entering the u.s. market .
the sugar program that congress enacted in the 1981 farm bill required the secretary of agriculture to support prices of u.s. sugarcane and sugar beets at minimum levels — initially through purchases of processed sugar , and subsequently by offering nonrecourse loans .
critics of the program , including the coalition for sugar reform , which represents consumer , trade and commerce groups , manufacturing associations and food and beverage companies that use sugar , argue the sugar program acts to keep domestic prices far above world sugar prices .
the u.s. sugar program is singular among major agricultural commodity programs in that it combines a price support guarantee with a supply management structure that encompasses both domestic production for human use and sugar imports .
in so doing , the coalition contends the sugar program imposes a hidden tax on consumers and has led to the loss of jobs in the food manufacturing sector by encouraging imports of sugar - containing products and by providing manufacturers with an incentive to move facilities abroad to gain access to lower priced sugar .
