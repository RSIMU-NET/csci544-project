in 2013 , va estimated that about 1.5 million veterans required mental health services , including for mdd .
mdd is a particularly debilitating mental illness and is associated with reduced quality of life , reduced productivity , and increased risk for suicide .
research has identified numerous risk factors for suicide among given the debilitating effects that depression can have on veterans' quality of life , va's monitoring of veterans with mdd is critical to ensuring that they receive care that is associated with positive health care outcomes .
these negative effects underscore the importance for veterans of timely , evidence - based assessment for and treatment of mdd , which may include medications such as antidepressants , psychotherapy , or a combination of both .
additionally , the relatively high veteran suicide rate makes it important that va use data that it collects related to veteran suicides to drive its prevention efforts .
in addition to providing ongoing care to veterans with mdd , va plays a role in suicide risk assessment and prevention among veterans .
additionally , life stressors , such as marital or financial problems , contribute to a veteran's risk of suicide .
today i will address two areas: the extent to which ( 1 ) veterans with mdd who are prescribed an antidepressant receive recommended care , and ( 2 ) va medical centers ( vamc ) are collecting information on veteran suicides as required by va. my statement is based on a gao report released in november 2014 examining va's monitoring of veterans with mdd who have been prescribed an antidepressant and the use of suicide data within va. for our work examining the care received by veterans with mdd who are prescribed an antidepressant , we reviewed va policy documents and interviewed va central office officials responsible for developing and implementing va mental health policy .
based on our previous analysis of va data from veterans' medical records and administrative sources , 532,222 veterans had a diagnosis of mdd from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 , and among those veterans , about 499,000 ( 94 percent ) veterans were prescribed at least one antidepressant by a va provider .
according to va in a june 2013 report , about one - quarter of the 18 to 22 veterans who die by suicide each day were receiving care through va.veterans , which include substance use disorder , physical impairments , previous suicide attempts , and depression .
i am pleased to be here to discuss our recent work on the monitoring of veterans with major depressive disorder ( mdd ) who were prescribed an antidepressant and data collection efforts by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) on veteran suicides .
according to va , the prevalence of mdd among veterans being treated in va primary care settings is higher than that among the general population .
for our work examining the data that va requires vamcs to collect on veteran suicides , we reviewed va policies , guidance , and documents related to va's suicide prevention efforts to identify the data collected by va staff on veteran suicides .
in may 2015 , in preparation for this statement , we met with va officials to discuss the status of va's implementation of action plans to address the six recommendations included in our november 2014 report .
