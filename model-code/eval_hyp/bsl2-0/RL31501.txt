congressional hearings were followed by extensive study of the issue â€” and by several unsuccessful efforts to deal with child labor through law .
finally , with the adoption of the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) of 1938 , the modern federal role in child labor regulation took shape .
debate over the regulation of child labor is often contentious , sparking sharp differences of opinion .
second , with world war ii , the focus shifted to alleged labor shortages for war production .
some urged modification of work restrictions for older children: too young for the draft but old enough to be useful employees .
first , from the late 19 th century to 1941 , reformers sought to remove children from the workplace ( whether factory , field , or tenement house ) and to encourage more extended school attendance .
some have urged modification of existing federal child labor law to afford greater opportunities for young persons to learn the value of work or to gain entry into a skilled occupation .
child labor can also provide an occasion for youth to be exploited and , possibly , endangered .
fourth , since roughly the late 1980s , child labor in its various aspects has largely disappeared from the policy scene ; the issue is often viewed as a remnant of an earlier period in american history .
this report briefly describes the early history of child labor regulation , reviews recent federal initiatives in that area , and summarizes legislation from the 108 th congress through the 113 th congress .
thus , various "school - to - work" transition programs were developed together with "incentives" for employers to hire youth workers .

others have questioned whether minors should be employed at all , especially while attending school .
too many older youths were believed to be out of school , out of work , and unable to find employment for which , it was argued , they were often unprepared both in terms of training and discipline .
third , by the late 1940s , another shift took place .
although the basic structure of the act has changed little since 1938 , congress has altered specific provisions of the statute and dol has variously refined its administration through the rulemaking process .
regulation of child labor has been motivated by diverse concerns: economic , humane , and more broadly social .
the flsa , as amended , protects children by setting conditions under which they may be employed and , in certain types of work , prohibiting their employment altogether .
several bills from prior congresses were re - introduced .
by the late 1940s , exploitation and endangerment of young children in the world - of - work was popularly believed to have been resolved through legislation ( the flsa ) and through the administrative discretion of the secretary of labor in implementing the flsa .
