the department of defense ( dod ) relies heavily on federal contractors to support its missions and in fiscal year 2008 spent approximately $396 billion on contracts for products and services .
this follow - on report ( 1 ) assesses trends and purposes for defense contractors' offshore subsidiaries ; ( 2 ) identifies how selected defense contractors used offshore subsidiaries to support ongoing defense contracts ; and ( 3 ) assesses dod oversight and management of defense contractors using offshore subsidiaries .
congress included a provision in the heroes earnings assistance and relief tax ( heart ) act of 2008 that addressed concerns about contractor use of offshore subsidiaries to minimize u.s. taxes .
this provision resulted in foreign subsidiaries of u.s. companies working on u.s. government contracts being required to pay certain payroll taxes .
the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2009 directed gao to report on the rationale , implications , and costs and benefits for both the contractor and dod in using offshore subsidiaries , with respect to several issues , including: tax liability ; legal liability ; compliance with cost accounting standards ; efficiency in contract performance ; and contract management and contract oversight .
dod uses thousands of contractor employees to assist in operations around the world to support u.s. forces deployed abroad with services ranging from security details to transportation and facility management .
to conduct our work , we identified 29 u.s. publicly traded defense contractors with $1 billion or more in dod spending in fiscal year 2008 , and reviewed information from securities and exchange commission ( sec ) filings to determine which of these contractors had offshore subsidiaries .
gao and others have found that contractors also use offshore subsidiaries to reduce u.s. taxes and maintain subsidiaries in tax haven and financial privacy jurisdictions .
congress should consider whether further legislative actions are needed to require payment of unemployment taxes for u.s. workers hired by offshore subsidiaries to perform services overseas .
many federal contractors operate globally through offshore subsidiaries to take advantage of favorable labor and market conditions .
while unemployment insurance taxes are much lower than those for fica , this continues to allow for a potential tax advantage for contractors hiring u.s. workers through offshore subsidiaries for u.s. government contracts performed overseas .
to fulfill our mandate we briefed your staffs on the results of our review .
to determine whether contractors using offshore subsidiaries selected for case studies were subject to payroll taxes , including social security , medicare , and federal and state unemployment taxes for u.s. employees , we reviewed contract file documents for the contractors and interviewed defense contract audit agency ( dcaa ) officials .
to identify examples of how contractors use subsidiaries and dod contractor management and oversight , we identified the categories of dod services most often performed overseas and selected six illustrative contracts as case studies based on several factors including the amount of contract dollars obligated , contracting command , and services using large numbers of u.s. personnel .
notwithstanding these changes , the heart act did not address unemployment taxes for u.s. workers of offshore subsidiaries , and some contractors continue to avoid these taxes .
for each of these contracts , we reviewed data on contractor performance and interviewed dod oversight staff , contracting commands , and company officials responsible for these defense contracts .
