fiscal imbalances faced by the federal government will continue to constrain discretionary spending .
over the last 5 years , the department of defense ( dod ) has doubled its planned investments in new weapon systems from about $700 billion in 2001 to nearly $1.4 trillion in 2006 .
one of the single largest investments the government makes is the development and production of new weapon systems .
at the same time , research and development cost growth on new weapons maintains its historical level of about 30 to 40 percent .
this is a tremendous undertaking that will involve a total investment cost on the order of $200 billion .
rather , the key to getting better outcomes is to make individual programs more executable .
this is the lens that must be used to look at major new investments , such as fcs , because more money may not be an option for the future .
the context within which the fcs investment is being made is important .
this report responds to the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 , which requires gao to report annually on the product development phase of the fcs's acquisition .
today , i would like to discuss ( 1 ) the scope of the business case that we feel is necessary for the fcs to be successful and ( 2 ) our recent recommendations to dod and matters for congressional consideration regarding the fcs program .
fcs is in the forefront of efforts to help the army transform itself into a lighter , more agile , and more capable combat force by using a new concept of operations , new technologies , and a new information network linking whole brigades together .
recently , we testified before the senate armed services committee about the fcs's business case and related business arrangements .
my statement today is based on our recently issued report about the need for an improved business case for the fcs .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of the army's future combat system ( fcs ) , a networked family of weapons and other systems .
with the restructuring , the fcs program now plans to achieve initial operational capability in fiscal year 2015 and full operational capability in fiscal year 2017 .
fcs low - rate production is expected to start in fiscal year 2012 , and full - rate production in fiscal year 2016 .
several efforts within the fcs program are facing significant problems that may eventually involve reductions in promised capabilities and may lead to cost overruns and schedule delays .
the new contract will incorporate standard federal acquisition regulation clauses such as those relating to procurement integrity , truth in negotiations , and cost accounting standards .
the restructuring reintroduced 4 systems that previously had been left unfunded , raising the total number of fcs - related systems to 18 .
the restructure also included plans to spin off mature fcs capabilities as they become available to current force units .
the army intends to continue fcs procurement through fiscal year 2025 , eventually equipping 15 brigade combat teams .
the army's purpose for using such an agreement was to encourage innovation and to use its wide latitude in tailoring business , organizational , and technical relationships to achieve the program goals .
