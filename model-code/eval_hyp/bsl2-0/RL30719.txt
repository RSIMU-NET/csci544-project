broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the united states .
while the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow , studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban / suburban and high - income areas is outpacing deployment in rural and low - income areas .
in addition to loans , loan guarantees , and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment , a wide array of policy instruments are available to policymakers , including universal service reform , tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment , broadband bonds , demand - side incentives ( such as assistance to low - income families for purchasing computers ) , reducing regulatory barriers to broadband deployment , and spectrum policy to spur rollout of wireless broadband services .

in june 2017 , the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) released an updated comprehensive guide to federal funding of broadband projects .
to the extent that congress may consider various options for encouraging broadband deployment and adoption , a key issue is how to strike a balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service , while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment .
the guide provides summary and contact information for a variety of federal programs that may fund projects involving broadband infrastructure , adoption , access , planning , or research .
