on january 10 , 2013 , the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) released a final rule implementing the ability - to - repay ( atr ) requirement of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ; p.l .
111-203 ) .
some observers and mortgage market participants have expressed concerns that , because of the additional legal protection , some lenders will only originate mortgages that receive qm status .
a qualified mortgage ( qm ) provides additional legal protections for a lender that the other options do not afford .
section 1411 of the dodd - frank act states that , no creditor may make a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that , at the time the loan is consummated , the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan , according to its terms , and all applicable taxes , insurance ( including mortgage guarantee insurance ) , and assessments .
the final rule is effective january 10 , 2014 , one year after it was issued .
as discussed later in this report , lenders can comply with the statute in different ways , one of which is by originating "qualified mortgages," certain mortgages that meet criteria laid out in the atr rule .
the scope of the qm definition , therefore , could affect who can qualify for a mortgage .
this report summarizes the atr rule and analyzes the potential effects it may have on the mortgage market .
the next section provides background information on the perceived problems in the mortgage market that motivated the atr requirement .
some potential issues are described below .
in addition to affecting who may receive a mortgage , the atr rule may have other effects on the mortgage market .
the federal reserve's 2008 ability - to - repay rule enhanced the prior approaches to consumer protection that generally emphasized disclosure to borrowers .
when house prices started to fall and the economy weakened in 2007 , foreclosure rates increased significantly , especially for loans with little or no documentation of borrower income or assets .
the atr requirements in the dodd - frank act are similar to the federal reserve's 2008 rule but expand the atr requirements to a broader portion of the mortgage market , not just higher - priced mortgages .
attempts to ensure that the only borrowers who receive mortgages are those who can repay the mortgage may result in some borrowers being excluded who could actually have repaid their loan .
some observers and mortgage market participants have expressed concerns that lenders will only originate mortgages that satisfy the safe harbor qm requirements even though there are alternative methods of complying with the atr rule .
the final rule provides six methods for lenders to comply: ( 1 ) the general atr option , ( 2 ) the standard qualified mortgage , ( 3 ) the temporary agency / gse qm option , ( 4 ) balloon mortgages in rural or underserved areas , ( 5 ) the temporary small creditor balloon - payment qm , and ( 6 ) the small creditor qm .
