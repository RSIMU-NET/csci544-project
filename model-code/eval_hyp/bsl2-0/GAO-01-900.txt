this report provides the results of our review of the fine collection activities of the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , and nine exchanges and industry associations that act as self - regulatory organizations ( sro ) in the securities and futures industries .
as agreed with your staff , this report ( 1 ) compares how the securities and futures regulators' current collection rates have changed since our prior report and assesses the changes they made in their fine imposition practices , ( 2 ) discusses the steps taken by sec and cftc to oversee the sros' fine imposition activities , including the actions they have recently taken to improve this oversight , and ( 3 ) assesses the effectiveness of actions taken by sec and cftc to refer unpaid fines to the department of the treasury's financial management service ( fms ) .
however , for fines to be an effective means of ensuring adherence with the rules , regulators must collect them .
levying fines is an important mechanism that regulators use to sanction those who violate securities and futures industry rules .
as you requested , we have collected updated information on these regulators' fine collections and practices and assessed the changes they have made in response to the recommendations in our previous report .
we reported on the fine collection activity of sec , cftc , and nine securities and futures sros in november 1998 and presented their collection rates for 1992 through 1996 .
sec has enforcement programs and processes for taking actions against violators of federal securities laws , and cftc has similar programs and processes for taking actions against violators of futures laws .
sec and cftc are responsible for administering and enforcing federal securities and commodity futures laws and regulations , respectively .
both nasd and nfa made changes in their fine imposition practices that improved their overall collection rates .
however , these changes could result in barred violators being more willing to seek readmission into these industries .
weaknesses in procedures for ensuring that cftc submits all needed information to fms to collect its unpaid fines also appear to have further delayed fms' collection efforts .
because older fines are harder to collect , fms prospects for collecting cftc fines would improve if cftc would more promptly refer its cases to fms .
sec and cftc are responsible for overseeing and regulating the operations and activities of their respective sros .
two sros - - nasd for the securities industry and nfa for the futures industry - - are associations that regulate registered securities and futures firms as well as oversee individuals employed in the securities and futures industries .
the agency's inspector general staff have recommended steps to ensure that cftc fines are submitted more timely to fms , but these steps have yet to be implemented .
the other seven sros we reviewed also continued to collect most of their fines .
securities and futures statutes authorize the establishment of sros subject to sec and cftc oversight , which regulate and operate markets in which securities and futures are traded .
a great deal of market regulation is carried out through sec's and cftc's oversight of national exchanges and sros .
