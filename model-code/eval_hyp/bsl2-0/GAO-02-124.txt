for a number of years , the department of defense has been researching and developing defenses against ballistic missile attacks on the united states , its deployed forces , friends , and allies .
boeing's sensor was tested in june 1997 ( integrated flight test 1a ) and raytheon's sensor was tested in january 1998 ( integrated flight test 2 ) .
the three contractors proceeded with development of the kill vehicle designs and built and tested key subsystems ( such as the sensor ) until 1994 .
in 1990 , the department awarded research and development contracts to three contractors to develop and test exoatmospheric kill vehicles .
however , because such terms are qualitative and subjective rather than quantitative and objective , their use increased the likelihood that test results would be interpreted in different ways and might even be misunderstood .
both rockwell — portions of which in december 1996 became boeing north american — and hughes — now raytheon — continued designing and testing their kill vehicles .
rather , they were early research and development tests that the program office considered experiments to primarily reduce risk in future flight tests .
however , neither project officials nor contractors could provide us with documentation of these communications .
in 1997 and 1998 , the national missile defense joint program office conducted tests , in space , of the sensors being developed by the contractors for their competing kill vehicles .
 ( this office within the national missile defense joint program office is responsible for the exoatmospheric kill vehicle contracts. ) .
the department planned to use the best of the three vehicles in a follow - on missile defense program .
specifically , the tests were designed to determine if the sensor could operate in space ; to examine the extent to which the sensor could detect small differences in infrared emissions ; to determine if the sensor was accurately calibrated ; and to collect target signature data for post - mission discrimination analysis .
the software was to analyze data collected in flight by the kill vehicle's sensor ( which collects real - time information about threat objects ) , enabling the kill vehicle to distinguish an enemy warhead from accompanying decoys .
program officials said these tests were not meant to demonstrate that the sensor met performance requirements , nor were they intended to be the basis for any contract award decisions .
as part of our ongoing review of missile defense testing , we are examining the need for improvements in test reporting .
you also asked us to determine whether the department of defense misused the security classification process to stifle public discussion of possible problems with the national missile defense system .
in 1994 , the department of defense eliminated martin marietta from the competition .
he emphasized that robust discrimination depends on the ability to predict signatures and then to match in - space measurements with those predictions .
the engineer helped evaluate some facets of a technology known as the extended kalman filter feature extractor , which trw planned to add as an enhancement to its discrimination software .
the engineer has continued to pursue her lawsuit without justice's intervention .
efforts to find and implement solutions were in progress .
