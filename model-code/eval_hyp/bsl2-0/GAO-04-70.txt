irs's most recent estimates are that in tax year 2001 more than 55 percent of the nearly 130 million individual filers paid someone to prepare their tax returns , and in tax year 2000 , taxpayers paid almost $15 billion for individual tax preparation services .
for example , last year we estimated that as many as 2 million taxpayers overpaid their 1998 taxes by $945 million because they claimed the standard deduction when it would have been more beneficial to itemize , and half of these taxpayers used a paid preparer .
concerned that some paid preparers might not be diligent when completing tax returns , you asked us to ( 1 ) obtain the views of taxpayers who used paid preparers and provide examples of paid preparer performance , including what is known about the extent of problems caused by paid preparers and ( 2 ) describe irs's efforts to prevent , detect , and take action against problem paid preparers ; the management challenges facing irs offices that interact with paid preparers , especially the office of professional responsibility ; and the efforts to address those management challenges .
however , using a paid preparer does not always assure that taxpayers will pay the least amount of taxes that are legally due .
many taxpayers do not understand their filing requirements and would have great difficulty filling out their tax forms without the assistance of paid preparers .
while this sample is representative of all taxpayers who used paid preparers , it has some limitations and must be interpreted carefully because it is based on taxpayer perceptions .
taxpayers responding to our survey may not understand the tax laws well enough to evaluate whether they received quality service from their paid preparers , resulting in inflated satisfaction levels .
in recent years irs has often met such resource needs by decreasing staffing of its enforcement activities .
filing a correct tax return can be a daunting task for taxpayers .
such data would be needed to properly evaluate proposals for changing irs's role .
we also interviewed paid preparers , representatives of professional organizations , various irs officials , and low - income tax clinic directors .
while the federal government and some state and local governments have taken actions intended to address problematic preparer behavior , the effectiveness of the actions is not known .
to address the objectives , we surveyed a nationwide random sample of taxpayers who used paid preparers .
in addition , unless given a budget increase irs would have to divert resources from other priorities in order to carry out expanded industry oversight responsibilities .
because making decisions about irs's role is a policy matter and because data are not available to determine the efficacy of irs's current oversight efforts , whether to expand irs's role in ensuring taxpayers receive quality service from paid preparers is a judgment that congress and irs management must make .
in addition , we conducted in - depth interviews with a smaller judgmental sample of taxpayers who provided examples of paid preparer performance , but we were unable to independently verify the facts in the taxpayers' examples .
at least two proposals exist for legislative action , one from the taxpayer advocate and the other , the low income taxpayer protection act of 2003 , s. 685 , proposed in the108th congress .
