we make several recommendations to the secretary of agriculture about how to resolve issues and problems regarding cattle price modeling .
what are the most significant data and modeling issues to be considered in developing a more comprehensive model , or logical framework , to explain cattle prices and producers' incomes ? .
to what extent do these models incorporate structural changes â€” specifically , market concentration in the meatpacking sector and the use of marketing agreements , forward contracts , and imports ? .
what are the most important factors that affect cattle prices and producers' incomes ? .
as agreed with your office , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issue date .
we will then send copies to the appropriate congressional committees ; the secretary of agriculture ; the chairman , u.s. international trade commission , and the director , office of management and budget .
we are pleased to respond to your request that we review economic models of the u.s. department of agriculture and u.s. international trade commission , especially their treatment of competition , marketing practices , and international trade effects on u.s. cattle prices and producers' incomes .
in this report , we address three research questions .
we will also make copies available to others upon request .
if you have any questions about this report or would like to discuss it further , i can be reached at ( 202 ) 512-2700 .
key contributors to the report are listed in appendix viii .
most beef exports from the united states are choice cuts , while most imports into the united states are used for ground beef .
in addition , structural changes that have been reshaping segments of the industry are affecting cattle demand and supply .
baseline projections are also used to determine the incremental effects of proposed changes in agricultural policy .
beef imports , in contrast , have ranged between 7 percent and 11 percent of u.s. commercial production since 1970 , seen in figure 12 .
the united states imports more cattle than it exports , as seen in figure 13 .
beef exports rose from less than 1 percent of u.s. beef consumption in 1970 to 9 percent in 1999 , seen in figure 11 .
producers' fortunes also hinge on how weather affects the supply and cost of forage and feed grains .
for instance , the outcome for producers depends on how consumer tastes affect the demand and price for beef .
the long biological cycle for cattle means that producers have to make supply decisions about herd size long before animals are sold and prices are known .
but behind this simple arithmetic are a host of demand and supply factors that influence cattle prices and the costs of raising cattle .
although the united states is the largest beef producer in the world , and although its exports of beef to other nations have grown more rapidly than its imports , it is a net beef importer , as depicted in figure 10 .
the livelihood of cattle producers depends fundamentally on the price they receive for their product and their cost to produce it .
