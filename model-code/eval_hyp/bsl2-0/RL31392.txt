instead of authorizing taxation , congress usually has chosen to create various payment programs designed to compensate for lost tax revenue .
these programs take various forms .
the most wide - ranging payment program is called payments in lieu of taxes ( pilt ) .
the growing discrepancy between appropriations and the rising authorization levels led to even greater levels of frustration among many local governments and prompted intense interest among some members in increasing appropriations .

 ( see figure 2 . ) .
given such issues , and the complexity of federal land management policies , consensus on substantive change in the pilt law has been elusive .
because local governments often are financed by property or sales taxes , this inability to tax the property values or products derived from the federal lands may affect local tax bases , sometimes significantly .
it is administered by the department of the interior ( doi ) and affects most acreage under federal ownership .
if the federal government controls a significant share of a county's property , then the revenue - raising capacity of that county may be compromised .
the resulting law authorizes federal pilt payments to local governments .
however , most military lands , lands under the department of energy ( which have their own smaller payment program ) , lands of the national aeronautics and space administration , and lands of the department of homeland security are not eligible for payments under pilt .
generally , federal lands may not be taxed by state or local governments unless the governments are authorized to do so by congress .

eligible lands consist of those in the national park system ( nps ) , nfs , or bureau of land management ( blm ) ; certain lands in the nwrs if they are withdrawn from the public domain ; lands dedicated to the use of federal water resources development projects ; dredge disposal areas under the jurisdiction of the u.s. army corps of engineers ; lands located in the vicinity of purgatory river canyon and pi√±on canyon , colorado , that were acquired after december 31 , 1981 , to expand the fort carson military reservation ; lands on which are located semi - active or inactive army installations used for mobilization and for reserve component training ; and certain lands acquired by doi or the department of agriculture under the southern nevada public land management act ( p.l .
many of the broader issues of federal compensation to counties that were addressed when pilt was created have reemerged over the years .
in fy2016 , the pilt program covered 606.9 million acres , or about 94% of all federal land .
