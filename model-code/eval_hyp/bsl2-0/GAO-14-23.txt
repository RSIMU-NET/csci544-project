in 2009 , a law — commonly referred to as the secure water act — was enacted , requiring , among other things , that reclamation establish a climate change adaptation program to ( 1 ) assess the effect of and risk resulting from global climate change on the quantity of water resources and ( 2 ) develop strategies to address potential water shortages and other impacts .
also in 2009 , the president signed executive order 13514 , calling for federal agencies to participate in the existing interagency climate change adaptation task force ( task force ) .
reclamation was also required to report to relevant congressional committees its progress implementing the act within 2 years of passage and every 5 years thereafter .
congress and the executive office of the president have directed federal agencies to address the potential impacts of climate change .
the executive order directed the task force to develop federal recommendations for adapting to climate change impacts both domestically and internationally and to recommend key components to include in a national strategy .
the effects of climate change on water resources have already been observed and are expected to continue .
global change research program , climate - related changes — including increases in air and water temperatures , changes in precipitation patterns , reduced snow cover , retreating glaciers , and rising sea levels — will likely adversely affect many aspects of the natural environment in the united states .
the u.s. department of the interior's ( interior ) u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) has reported that of all the potential threats posed by climate change , those associated with water resources are arguably the most consequential for both society and the environment .
the department of defense's u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) and interior's bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) own and operate key water resource management infrastructure , such as canals , dams , and reservoirs , that may be affected by climate change .
based on the task force recommendations , the president's council on environmental quality issued implementing instructions directing federal agencies to , among other things , establish an agency climate change adaptation policy and deliver to the council and the office of management and budget a climate adaptation plan for implementation in fiscal year 2013 .
gao added limiting the federal government's fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks to our 2013 update of high - risk areas because of the government's role , among other things , as the owner or operator of extensive infrastructure .
this report examines ( 1 ) the actions the corps and reclamation have taken since 2009 to assess and respond to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure and ( 2 ) what challenges , if any , the corps and reclamation face in assessing and responding to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure , and the steps the agencies are taking to address them .
as we reported in october 2009 , policymakers are increasingly viewing adaptation — defined by the national research council as adjustments in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects — as a risk - management strategy to protect vulnerable resources that might be affected by changes in the climate .
