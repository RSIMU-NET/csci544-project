in fiscal year 1994 , the federal government reported travel obligations for individuals of about $7.6 billion — about $5 billion for the department of defense ( dod ) and about $2.6 billion for the civilian agencies .
they must cut costs while still maintaining , if not improving , operations .
real change , concrete improvements , and substantive cost savings will not occur until underlying processes are systematically reassessed and reengineered .
a handful of federal agencies have also begun to implement best practices and reduce costs .
federal executives , operating in the current environment of reduction and change , face a difficult challenge .
most efforts that have attempted to address this challenge have had to come to grips with the difficulties of change — change is easy to talk about , but it is much harder to accomplish .
it is usually much easier to cut , than it is to improve .
indeed , there has been a growing acknowledgement within government that what is needed is a revamping of how the government does what it does .
the general services administration ( gsa ) currently negotiates some of these direct rates with travel vendors , at significant savings to federal agencies .
this amount was for direct costs ( i.e. , costs directly related to travel , such as transportation , lodging , rental cars , etc. ) .
i know that you and other members of this subcommittee are deeply concerned about finding ways for federal agencies to cut costs and streamline operations .
one area with great potential for reengineering is travel management , and with good reason .
related primarily to two types of travel — temporary duty ( tdy ) and permanent relocation .
in doing so , millions in administrative costs have been saved .
there is no reason , however , why all federal agencies cannot achieve comparable results .
and the costs for improvement are low , especially given the potential return — hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved .
with some variation , the essential elements of travel are similar for almost any organization , private or public .
that is why i am very pleased to be here today to discuss governmentwide travel management , ways in which it can be improved , and the efforts underway to do so .
there are a number of private - sector companies who have set themselves apart from other organizations , both public and private , by streamlining and automating their travel processes and adopting a common set of best practices .
these administrative costs can be significant , into the hundreds of millions of dollars , especially when considering the number of travel authorizations and vouchers that are processed each year .
last march , we reported to this subcommittee on our work assessing and comparing dod's travel practices to those of two leading organizations .
mr. chairman , because of the interest you and other members of this subcommittee have shown in the demonstrated improvements of these leading organizations , we set out to discover how they manage travel , what practices and strategies they followed to get there , and how federal agencies compare .
for instance , an organization may be able to reduce administrative costs by eliminating process steps ; however , without also ensuring that appropriate internal controls remain in place , the increased risk of fraud and abuse may outweigh any savings that are achieved .
