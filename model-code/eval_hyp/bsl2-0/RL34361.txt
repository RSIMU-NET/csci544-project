legislation on the topic has also been introduced in the 111 th congress .
the federal election campaign act ( feca ) does not require detailed reporting about automated political calls .
thus far , however , legislative developments on the issue have been quieter in the 111 th congress than during the 110 th congress .
several bills introduced in the 110 th congress would have imposed additional regulations on automated political calls , but would not necessarily apply to all circumstances in which the calls are used .
federal agencies and the oversight process could provide such information .
political committees also have few incentives to make information about automated calls public .
automated calls remain a prominent campaign tactic and continue to appear on the congressional agenda .
by contrast , those providing automated political calls ( so - called "vendors" ) often receive limited attention .
finally , congress could place additional disclosure or disclaimer requirements on political calls .
another relatively limited approach would be to encourage voluntary changes by practitioners .
by contrast , if congress chose to require policy changes , it could add political calls to the do not call list or restrict the timing or number of calls .
some of those options would likely involve difficult questions about which groups and messages are devoted to campaign activities versus policy advocacy .
academic research that does exist tends to focus on campaign strategists , especially political consultants such as pollsters and media specialists .
the calls can therefore play an important role in get - out - the - vote ( gotv ) and voter - education activities .
many of the concerns surrounding automated political calls are not about the calls themselves , but about how those calls are used .
identifying those responsible for calls is also a concern .
in addition to this lack of data from regulators and practitioners , campaign tactics and political consulting receive limited scholarly attention .
congress , therefore , has various options for addressing automated political calls , if it chooses to do so at all .
aside from maintaining the status quo , one relatively cautious option would be gathering additional data before choosing a policy approach .
those who oppose the calls generally argue that they are intrusive , that too many calls are placed to individual voters , or that they are too often used to convey negative information .
the calls are an inexpensive way to reach large numbers of voters quickly .
they are also used to announce events and solicit campaign volunteers .
automated political calls generally include prerecorded messages that provide information about candidates or urge voters to go to the polls .
specifically , the bills would: ( 1 ) add political calls to the ftc do not call list ; ( 2 ) revise disclosure or disclaimer requirements or otherwise restrict automated political calls ; or ( 3 ) regulate political calls generally , which could include automated calls .
it also discusses broader issues that are likely to affect whatever policy options congress chooses .
four bills introduced in the 111 th congress would affect automated political calls , as would have 10 bills introduced in the 110 th congress .
federal agencies and the oversight process could provide additional information .
