this report will not dis cuss potential consequences of changes to anti - poverty programs , nor will it provide an analys is of poverty trends .
also , it may better illustrate how medical expenses and work - related expenses such as child care can affect a family's economic well - being .
as its name might suggest , t he s upplemental poverty measure ( spm ) was developed to supplement , but not replace , the official poverty measure by addre ssin g some of its met hodological limitations .
t he official measure provides a consistent historical view of poverty in the united states , but t he spm may be better suited to help ing c ongress ional policymakers and other experts understand how taxes and government programs affect the poor .
this report describes the spm , how it was developed , how it differ s from the official poverty measure , and the insights it can offer .
the spm was developed after decades of research focused on overcoming the limitations of the official poverty measure .
these limitations are not easy to surmount , as evidenced by dozens of alternative poverty measures developed over the years by the census bureau and by academia , and the working papers and reports written about those measures .
for example , in fy2015 the federal government spent $5.5 billion on veterans' pensions , $6.4 billion on tanf cash assistance , and $62.1 billion on supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
particularly visible and of possible relevance to congress are the effects that taxes and tax credits , noncash transfer programs , and work - related and medical expenses have on poverty .
social security , along with ssi , tanf , and other cash welfare assistance ; unemployment insurance ; child support received ; and workers' compensation , are money income sources that are included in both the official poverty measure and the spm .
while most of those kept above poverty by social security were ages 65 and older ( 17.1 million ) , a substantial minority were younger: 7.5 million were age 18 to 64 , and 1.5 million were children under age 18 .
of these , none individually have as large an impact on the estimated poor population as social security .
of these income sources , social security has the biggest impact on the number of persons kept out of poverty according to the spm ( 26.1 million persons in 2016 ) .
even with improved visibility into those areas , however , the spm has important limitations to be considered .
after it , the components with the most impact are moop ( with 10.5 million persons added to the poverty population once those expenses are taken into account ) ; refundable tax credits ( with 8.1 million kept out of the estimated poor population because they or a family member received the credits ) , work expenses , including child care ( 6.0 million added to the poverty population , on the margin ) ; fica ( 4.7 million added to the poverty population , on the margin ) ; and snap ( 3.6 million kept out of the poor population , on the margin ) .
