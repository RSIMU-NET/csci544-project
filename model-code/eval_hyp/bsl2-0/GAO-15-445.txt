fps , a subcomponent of the national protection and programs directorate within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , is the primary agency responsible for protecting federal buildings .
as recently as late october 2014 , the federal protective service ( fps ) took actions designed to enhance its presence and security at various federal buildings it protects in light of recent world events targeting government personnel and buildings .
given continued concerns related to the security of federal buildings , you requested that we examine the effectiveness of fps's and usms's efforts to prevent prohibited items and individuals who may pose a security threat from entering gsa buildings .
these incidents highlight the importance of protecting the over 1-million government employees who work in , as well as the public who visits the over 8,900 buildings in the united states that are held or leased by the general services administration ( gsa ) .
these challenges include: ( 1 ) building characteristics and location that may limit security options ; ( 2 ) balancing security and public access ; ( 3 ) operating with limited resources ; ( 4 ) working with multiple federal tenants ; and ( 5 ) effectively informing the public of prohibited items .

isc , items prohibited from federal facilities: an interagency security committee standard ( washington , d.c.: february 2013 ) .
protective security officers and court security officers are primarily responsible for controlling access to these federal buildings by checking the identification of government employees and visitors and operating security equipment , such as x - ray machines and walk - through magnetometers , to screen for and prevent the entry of prohibited items including illegal items such as firearms .
officers are security guards contracted to provide various security functions at federal buildings .
these officers are generally the first contact with federal agencies for individuals entering federal buildings and courthouses .
the interagency security committee ( isc ) defines a prohibited item as an item , legal or illegal in nature , where possession is restricted from entry into a facility by federal , state , or local law , regulation , court order , rule , or facility security committee policy .
to determine actions federal entities have taken to assess the effectiveness of their screening efforts and the results of these efforts , we compared fps's and usms's efforts to comply with gao's standards for internal control in the federal government,wide standards and key practices as identified by the isc , including the risk management process for federal facilities and the items prohibited as well as to government - from federal facilities .
