states may use federal funding to assist youth in foster care as they transition to adulthood under title iv - e of the social security act ( title iv - e ) , which authorizes federal support for state foster care and adoption assistance programs .
data from the administration for children and families ( acf ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , show that nearly 102,000 of these children were youth nearing adulthood ( ages 14 and up ) .
additionally , they faced housing instability and had higher rates of other economic hardships compared with the general population .
these youth also experienced physical or psychological trauma which may have affected their mental health .
in fiscal year 2017 , over 440,000 children were in the foster care system , largely due to neglect .
the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 ( fostering connections act ) allowed states to receive federal reimbursement under title iv - e for a portion of the cost of extending foster care to certain youth beyond their 18th birthday , up to age 21 .
in addition , the john h. chafee foster care program for successful transition to adulthood ( chafee program ) provides funding to states for independent living services , such as mentoring , educational assistance , and vocational training , to support older youth in foster care and youth who have recently left foster care .
additionally , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and hhs policies and related research .
our prior work and other research studies have found that youth in foster care are likely to face challenges as they transition to adulthood .
however , states generally may not seek federal reimbursement for placing youth under 18 in these settings .
this report examines ( 1 ) the types of supervised independent living arrangements available to youth in extended - care states , ( 2 ) what factors extended - care states reported considering when placing youth in supervised independent living , ( 3 ) what federal and other sources extended - care states use to fund supervised independent living arrangements for youth , and ( 4 ) how selected extended - care states prepare youth to live independently .
for example , studies conducted in three midwestern states found that youth transitioning to adulthood and out of state foster care systems at age 18 had lower rates of high school completion and enrollment in postsecondary education by age 19 , compared with the general population .
federal reimbursement under title iv - e is generally limited to eligible youth removed from homes with very low incomes , among other eligibility criteria .
states have several different options for implementing their extended care programs .
despite these efforts to increase supports for youth in foster care transitioning to adulthood , little is known about the living arrangements offered to youth ages 18 to 21 in states where extended care is offered ( extended - care states ) , especially how states have set up supervised independent living arrangements , and the types of services that assist these youth .
the survey included open - ended and closed - ended questions about states' policies and practices regarding supervised independent living arrangements , states' data on youth in extended care and in supervised independent living , state spending and funding sources for these living arrangements in state fiscal year 2017 , as well as questions about data reliability .
