until recently , the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) prohibited use of any other contract type except fixed - price for the acquisition of commercial items .
in 2003 , the services acquisition reform act ( sara ) explicitly provided that the far shall include authority for the use of t&m contracts for the procurement of commercial services .
thus , the government bears the risk of cost overruns .
proponents believed that increased use of t&m contracts for commercial services would encourage more commercial firms to compete for government business , while others , such as the department of defense inspector general , opposed expanded use of this high - risk contract type .
under far procedures for acquisition of commercial items and services , government agencies can acquire goods or services via a streamlined procurement process based on the idea that market forces will help ensure good prices .
although these contracts may be appropriate in certain circumstances , we reported in 2007 that contracting officers used this contract type for ease and flexibility in the face of unclear requirements or funding uncertainties and did not adequately determine , as required , that no other contract type was suitable .
time - and - materials ( t&m ) and labor - hour contracts are used to purchase billions of dollars in services across the federal government .
the cost growth on t&m and labor - hour contracts can be significant ; we and agency inspectors general have reported numerous instances in which the costs grew to more than double the original value â€” in one case a contract increased to almost 19 times the original price .
the question of whether or not t&m contracts could be used for commercial services had been the subject of debate and an issue of some contention .
under the schedules program , gsa establishes long - term , governmentwide contracts for commercially available goods and services , under which federal agencies can issue orders .
the far part 12 revisions included procedural safeguards to ensure that t&m contracts for commercial services are used only when no other contract type is suitable and that cost growth is monitored due to the inherent risks to the government of this contract type .
these contracts are considered high risk for the government because the contractor's profit is tied to the number of hours worked .
the part 12 d&f requirement is not explicitly mentioned in far subpart 8.4 , which sets forth procedures pertaining to the general services administration's ( gsa ) federal supply schedules program .
accordingly , we ( 1 ) identified the extent to which agencies have reported using t&m contracts and gsa schedule t&m orders for commercial services and what they are acquiring using this contract type , ( 2 ) evaluated the degree to which agencies complied with the far part 12 safeguards , and ( 3 ) determined the applicability of the safeguards to the gsa schedules program .
the conference report for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 directed us to report on the use of t&m contracts for commercial services across government agencies .
