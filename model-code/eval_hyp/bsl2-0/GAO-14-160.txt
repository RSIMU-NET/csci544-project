the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) administers nfip .
during fiscal year 2013 , fema collected about $3.7 billion in premiums for about $1.3 trillion in coverage .
the biggert - waters flood insurance reform act of 2012 ( biggert - waters act ) re - authorizes nfip through the end of fiscal year 2017 and includes provisions for flood insurance reform and modernization .
for example , after spending roughly 7 years and $40 million , in 2009 fema cancelled a major contract to modernize its systems for collecting data on claims and tracking the status of policies and claims because of multiple weaknesses in acquisition management , such as conflicts of interest and inadequate contract performance management .
weaknesses in nfip management and operations , including financial reporting processes and internal controls , and oversight of contractors have kept nfip on gao's list of high - risk areas since 2006 .
the program seeks to minimize the impact of flood - related property losses by making flood insurance available and encouraging its purchase by those who need flood insurance protection .
in earlier reports , we and the dhs office of inspector general found a number of operational challenges that hindered fema's ability to effectively administer nfip , including problems with fema's oversight of contractors responsible for performing key nfip functions .
this report examines ( 1 ) fema's progress in updating its process for monitoring nfip contractors since our prior reports , and ( 2 ) the extent to which fema followed its monitoring process for the largest nfip contractors .
the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) , the only source of insurance against flood damage for most residents of flood - prone areas , obligated approximately $900 million from fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to contractors to perform critical functions such as collecting and reporting all financial and statistical data , selling and servicing flood insurance policies , and modernizing the mapping of flood hazards .
to determine fema's progress in updating its process for monitoring nfip contractors , we analyzed dhs and fema policies , directives , guidance , and other materials related to contract management , including the use of a government - wide contractor assessment database and fema's electronic document management system .
to assess how fema followed its monitoring procedures , we collected data across three key areas: training and ethics requirements for contracting officer's representatives ( cor ) ; performance measures ; and ongoing monitoring and reporting .
additionally , we compared fema's process for monitoring nfip contractors with relevant legislation , internal control standards , contract management best practices , and related reports from the gao and the dhs office of inspector general about nfip .
we assessed fema's monitoring using agency procedures and contract management best practices , including standards for internal control in the federal government , the office of management and budget's office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) guide to best practices for contract administration , and guidance from fema and its risk insurance and risk analysis divisions .
section 100231 of the biggert - waters act mandates gao to review the three largest contractors used in administering nfip .
