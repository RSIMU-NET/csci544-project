in fiscal year 2017 , the marine corps obligated approximately $1.4 billion for its operational forces to be able to rapidly deploy ready forces in support of combatant commanders .
to develop its budget requests and allocate resources to provide capabilities necessary to accomplish its missions , the marine corps follows the planning , programming , budgeting , and execution process , which we refer to as the budget cycle , for purposes of this report .
specifically , we examined the extent to which the marine corps ( 1 ) tracks unit - level o&m training funds for ground combat forces through the budget cycle ; and ( 2 ) links unit - level training funds for ground combat forces to readiness .
however , the house armed services committee reported that the marine corps' budget estimates for training are not sufficiently detailed to determine training costs at the unit level or the amount of readiness expected to be generated by those costs .
in testimony before congress in 2017 , the commandant of the marine corps stated that the instability of and the level of funding available adversely impacted readiness .
a house report accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2018 contained a provision for us to examine the military services' budgeting processes to build unit - level training readiness and their processes for evaluating the amount of readiness generated from unit - level training costs .
to build readiness , the marine corps uses funds from its operation and maintenance ( o&m ) account to pay for training and education requirements for active marine corps forces , among other items .
for objective one , we analyzed fiscal year 2017 budget data collected from the marine expeditionary forces ( mefs ) .
training is key to building mission readiness â€” the military's ability to fight and meet the demands of assigned missions .
we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to assess the availability of fiscal year 2017 funding for unit - level training exercises ; however , we identified issues with tracking unit - level o&m training fund data , as discussed later in this report .
further , we reviewed a series of reports issued by the marine corps from fiscal years 2009 through 2014 , which evaluated the health of the marine corps , including its use of fiscal codes , through an enterprise - wide study of resource investments , organizational activities , and readiness outcomes .
we collected data for this fiscal year because it was the most recently completed fiscal year for which actual obligated amounts could be obtained .
we assessed this information against marine corps order 5230.23 , performance management planning , which calls for the development and implementation of an enterprise - wide performance management process that links resources to institutional readiness via a robust analytic framework , as well as standards for internal control in the federal government , which states that management should establish an organizational structure , assign responsibility , and delegate authority to achieve its objective .
 ( recommendation 3 ) .
we discussed the systems used to provide these data with knowledgeable marine corps officials .
for objective two , we reviewed reports and other documentation about marine corps efforts to evaluate readiness levels achieved from o&m obligations for training for ground combat forces .
