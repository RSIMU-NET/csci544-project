the issues in this work covered ( 1 ) the need for governmentwide strategic planning for the requirements for high - containment laboratories , including assessment of their risks ; ( 2 ) the need for national standards for designing , constructing , commissioning , operating , and maintaining such laboratories ; and ( 3 ) the oversight of biosafety and biosecurity at high - containment laboratories .
highly publicized laboratory errors and controversy about where high - containment laboratories should be located have raised questions about whether the governing framework , standards , and oversight for biosafety and biosecurity measures are adequate .
this testimony is primarily based on gao's past work on high - containment laboratories .
since 2007 , we have reported on several issues associated with the proliferation of high - containment laboratories and risks posed by past biosafety incidents .
the public is concerned about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to dangerous pathogens , whether deliberate or accidental , can have disastrous consequences .
on july 1 , 2014 , at the bethesda , maryland , national institutes of health ( nih ) , vials of potentially live smallpox ( variola ) virus were unexpectedly discovered .
on june 5 , 2014 , staff in atlanta laboratories at the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) were potentially exposed to live spores of the ames strain of anthrax ( bacillus anthracis or b. anthracis ) .
public attention is once again focused on the importance of maintaining biosafety and biosecurity protocols at high - containment laboratories .
my statement summarizes the results of our past work on the oversight of high - containment laboratories and our preliminary assessment of the recent incident in atlanta .
each report cited in this statement provides detailed information on our work's objectives , scope , and methodology ( the reports are listed at the end of this statement ) .
for our preliminary observations , on the june 5 â€“ 13 , 2014 biosafety incident at cdc's laboratories we interviewed cdc officials and reviewed agency documents and scientific literature .
i am pleased to be here today to participate in today's hearing to address recent biosecurity incidents .
we also reviewed cdc's july 11 , 2014 , report on the potential exposure to anthrax .
decisions to fund the construction of high - containment laboratories were made by multiple federal agencies ( e.g. , department of health and human services ( hhs ) , department of defense , usda ) , in multiple budget cycles .
we provided a draft of this statement to cdc for technical review and addressed their comments in the body of our statement where appropriate .
developed by the funding or regulatory agencies .
oversight is critical in improving biosafety and ensuring that high - containment laboratories comply with regulations .
the work this statement is based on was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions , based on our audit objectives .
federal and state agencies , academia , and the private sector ( such as drug companies ) considered their individual requirements , but as we have previously reported a robust assessment of national needs was lacking .
