although the epa draft report focused on one specific region where hydraulic fracturing was employed to enhance the production of natural gas , it has raised concerns about hydraulic fracturing practices in general , and whether epa's findings at pavillion are more broadly applicable to other regions of the country .
in its announcement , epa noted that the state intends to conclude its investigation and release a final report by september 30 , 2014 .
epa had extended the public comment period on its draft report through september 30 , 2013 , but on june 20 , 2013 , epa announced that it no longer plans to finalize the report .
epa indicated that it would defer to the state of wyoming to assume the lead role in investigating drinking water quality in the area , and that the continuing role of epa would focus on providing technical support and input to the state .
the scope of the investigation by the state would seek to address water quality concerns by evaluating the water quality of certain domestic water wells , the integrity of certain oil and gas wells , and the historic use of waste disposal pits in the pavillion area .
this crs report provides a synopsis of the statutory authority for epa's investigation under the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) , a summary of the primary findings in the epa draft report , and a brief discussion of issues raised subsequent to the release of the draft report by proponents and opponents of the use of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas development .
on december 8 , 2011 , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued a draft report on its investigation of groundwater contamination near the town of pavillion , wyoming .
in contrast , some environmental organizations cited epa's findings in calling for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing .
stakeholder responses of various industry and environmental organizations are discussed further below .
because the epa draft report linked groundwater contamination in wyoming to activities related to hydraulic fracturing , it had raised concerns about hydraulic fracturing practices in general .
some stakeholders also commissioned independent assessments of epa's draft report and released their respective assessments in may 2012 .
an assessment commissioned by an industry organization disagreed with epa's findings , whereas an assessment commissioned by four environmental organizations supported the agency's findings .
some stakeholders took issue with some of the findings in the draft report .
various organizations representing private business interests within the oil and gas industry questioned the scientific validity of epa's contention that "the explanation best fitting the data for the deep monitoring wells is that constituents associated with hydraulic fracturing have been released into the wind river drinking water aquifer at depths above the current production zone. .
in sum , the epa draft report has raised many issues , questions , and concerns among potentially affected stakeholders , including the oil and natural gas industry , environmental organizations , and individual citizens .
due to heightened interest , epa subsequently extended the public comment period for an additional 45 days through march 12 , 2012 .
epa reported in its june 20 , 2013 , announcement that the state's investigation would seek to clarify water quality concerns and assess the need for any further action to protect drinking water resources .
