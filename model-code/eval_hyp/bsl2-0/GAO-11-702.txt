sexual violence has been perpetrated against the civilian population ( men , women , and children ) by members of illegal armed groups and some congolese national military units , as well as by other civilians .
while opportunistic acts of sexual violence occur , members of illegal armed groups and congolese military units also use sexual violence to exact revenge on communities for their perceived cooperation with rival groups .
according to un officials , u.s. agency officials , and subject matter experts , the entire drc has been affected by war to varying degrees , but north kivu , south kivu , and the ituri district in orientale province ( hereafter referred to as eastern drc ) continue to suffer from ongoing conflict and violence and are considered war - torn ; three countries that border eastern drc are rwanda , uganda , and burundi .
according to united nations ( un ) and u.s. officials , researchers , and nongovernmental organization ( ngo ) representatives , sexual violence — a form of gender - based violence — includes any sexual act , attempted or perpetrated , such as rape or sexual slavery , carried out against the will of someone , whether male or female .
to respond to this objective , we reviewed relevant provisions of the dodd - frank wall street reform act and reviewed and analyzed relevant reports and other documents from the department of state ( state ) ; the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) ; the department of defense ( defense ) ; various un agencies , including the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) ; nongovernmental agencies , such as the international rescue committee ( irc ) ; and research organizations , such as the university of california ( uc ) berkeley human rights center , on sexual violence data collected in eastern drc and adjoining countries .
there are two basic types of data on sexual violence from war - torn eastern drc and adjoining countries: ( 1 ) data from population - based surveys , and ( 2 ) case file data , such as data collected by medical service providers or data collected by law enforcement or international entities on sexual violence victims .
although warfare between the drc and its neighbors has officially ended , conflict , especially in the eastern part of the drc , has persisted .
sexual violence has been a feature of conflict in the drc at least since the congolese civil war of the mid - 1990s .
large numbers of civilians in war - torn areas of the democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) have been the victims of horrific sexual violence , including rape , mutilation , and sexual slavery carried out by armed groups .
1502 ( d ) ) that we submit an annual report that assesses the rate of sexual and gender - based violence in war - torn areas of the drc and adjoining countries to appropriate congressional committees .
in this report , we identify and assess available information on sexual violence in war - torn eastern drc , as well as three neighboring countries that border eastern drc — rwanda , uganda , and burundi .
population - based surveys identify the extent of something specific ( such as whether a respondent has been sexually assaulted ) within a given population based on participants' responses .
