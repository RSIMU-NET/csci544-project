gao also noted that granting personnel flexibilities to federal agencies raises important issues as to the extent to which , or the mechanisms whereby , congress or opm will oversee these agencies to ensure their continued adherence to applicable civil service laws .
the legislative proposals — which would make some flexibilities permanently available and others available for testing — were intended to help irs improve its service to taxpayers and overcome longstanding performance problems .
federal agencies , including irs , need the flexibility to tailor their personnel approaches to best meet the demands of their missions .
the senate bill also includes classification and pay provisions ( “broad banding” ) and “critical pay authority” to help recruit and retain employees in highly skilled , high level , technical and professional positions .
performance and results act , gao stated that the degree of commitment by irs' leadership would determine whether a new focus on agency mission could be sustained for the long - term .
2676 and s. 1174 would give irs additional flexibilities relating to performance management , staffing , and the development of demonstration projects .
gao was asked to comment on the possible implications of proposed legislation that would give new personnel flexibility to the internal revenue service ( irs ) .
specifically , h.r .
with federal agencies now called upon to improve customer service and deliver better results to the american people while limiting costs , the need for a well - managed , well - qualified , and highly motivated workforce has never been greater .
therefore , it is not surprising that recent discussions have centered on the amount of flexibility federal agencies should have in hiring and managing their employees .
mr. chairman and members of the committee: i am pleased to be here today to discuss some of the possible implications of legislative proposals that would give new personnel flexibility to the internal revenue service ( irs ) .
along with this need for flexibility , there is a need to maintain oversight and accountability mechanisms that will ensure that agencies adhere to the statutorily required merit principles , such as maintaining high standards of integrity , conduct , and concern for the public interest and other national goals , such as veterans' preference .
third , federal agencies such as irs need the flexibility to tailor their personnel approaches to best meet the demands of their missions .
with regard to the personnel flexibility proposals for irs , i would like to make three points on the basis of our prior body of work in the human resource management area: first , because the proposals generally provide a broad outline for managing irs employees , but not the details , it is difficult to predict to what extent the new provisions will help irs improve its performance and overcome past problems .
at irs or any federal agency , the degree of commitment by top management will determine whether this new focus can be sustained .
second , the proposals , focusing as they do on customer service and on aligning employees' performance with the agency's mission , goals , and objectives , are in keeping with broad trends in the public and private sector that we have identified in our previous work .
