nonetheless , these provisions have continued to generate considerable debate in congress .
on december 3 , 2010 , the united states and south korea reached a further agreement that modified the auto sector provisions .
the provisions concerning automobiles and auto parts are among the most controversial elements of the korus fta .
on june 30 , 2007 , the united states and south korea signed the u.s. - south korea free trade agreement ( korus fta ) .
if approved by congress , it would be the second - largest u.s. free - trade agreement in terms of the value of trade affected , next to the north american free trade agreement , nafta .
one prominent issue in that discussion is the agreement's specific rules of origin ( roo ) for automobiles and auto parts .
these rules will be used to determine if automotive goods imported from south korea are eligible to receive duty - free or reduced tariff benefits under the korus fta , and whether automotive goods from the united states are eligible for corresponding benefits upon export to south korea .
finally , it discusses whether the domestic content rules in the korus fta could enable circumvention of the rules of origin by allowing automotive components produced in north korea's kaesong industrial complex ( kic ) to enter the united states duty - free in assembled motor vehicles , and thereby receive the benefits provided by the agreement .
it then explains the procedures established in the korus fta for determining whether an automotive product qualifies as being of south korean or united states origin and compares those procedures to the rules established in the free trade agreement between south korea and the european union .
parts imports from south korea account for only 5% of u.s. auto parts imports by value .
this report begins with a discussion of the complex supply chains that now underlie automotive production .
the south korean share has grown due to the establishment of south korean - owned assembly plants in the united states , as these plants make extensive use of south korean components .
the leading suppliers of parts to the united states are mexico and canada , whose producers have free access to the u.s. market under nafta .
in recent years , as shown in figure 2 , a greater share of imported parts has come from china .
a free trade agreement ( fta ) is a pact between two or more countries to eliminate tariff or non - tariff barriers affecting trade among these countries .
rules of origin matter to automobile assemblers because they determine what tariffs , or tariff concessions , apply to imported inputs , and therefore can be decisive in shaping trade patterns .
due to the high level of global competition in the automobile market , automakers source parts as inexpensively and efficiently as possible .
over the past two decades , the united states has concluded 11 bilateral and regional ftas .
as with other provisions , rvc requirements for automotive products vary among free trade agreements .
for example , ntr tariffs for automobiles in the countries that are parties to the dominican republic - central america - united states ( cafta - dr ) fta run as high as 20% .
