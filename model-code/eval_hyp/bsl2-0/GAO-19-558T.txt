even modest reductions to the tax gap would yield significant financial benefits and help improve the government's fiscal position .
my testimony today discusses ( 1 ) factors contributing to the tax gap and ( 2 ) strategies for reducing the tax gap .
for example , just a 1 percent reduction of the 2008-2010 average annual net tax gap would have resulted in about $4 billion more in annual revenue for those years .
for illustrative purposes , for fiscal year 2019 , this amount of revenue could fund about 82 percent of irs's enforcement budget ; the entire operation of the u.s. census bureau ; or the combined federal budgets of the national park system operations account , smithsonian institution , and the national archives and records administration .
the tax gap has been a persistent problem for decades , and enforcement of tax laws has been on our high risk list since its inception in 1990 .
irs estimated that through late payments and enforcement actions , it will collect an additional $52 billion annually for tax years 2008 to 2010 , resulting in an average annual net tax gap of $406 billion .
rather , the tax gap must be attacked on multiple fronts with multiple strategies over a sustained period of time .
we have previously reported that there are no easy fixes to this problem , and given persistent levels of noncompliance , reducing the tax gap will not likely be achieved through a single solution .
the most recent data available show that , in 2016 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) estimated an average annual gross tax gap of $458 billion for tax years 2008 to 2010 .
my comments are based on prior reports on the tax gap and enforcement of tax laws , including those with open recommendations or matters for congressional consideration that could help reduce the tax gap .
the products cited throughout this statement include detailed explanations of the methods used to conduct our work .
irs's budget declined by about $2.6 billion ( 18.8 percent ) from fiscal years 2011 through 2019 , and irs's budget for fiscal year 2019 is less than its fiscal year 2000 budget , after adjusting for inflation ( see figure 4 ) .
our past work has demonstrated that no single approach will fully and cost effectively address noncompliance since the problem has multiple causes and spans different types of taxes and taxpayers .
developing and documenting plans to assess its nrp employment tax study results would help irs ( 1 ) identify areas of noncompliance , ( 2 ) devise actions to address such noncompliance , and ( 3 ) update its employment tax gap estimate .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the tax gap â€” the difference between tax amounts that taxpayers should pay and what they actually pay voluntarily and on time .
in light of these challenges , we have made numerous recommendations to irs that have not yet been implemented , as well as matters for congressional consideration .
reducing examinations can reduce revenues collected through such enforcement action , and may indirectly reduce voluntary compliance .
irs's overall approach to reducing the tax gap consists of improving services to taxpayers , and enhancing enforcement of the tax laws .
