unfortunately , most of the data that at&t uses to support its arguments are redacted from the documentation that is publicly available or available to crs and therefore , to a great extent , it is not possible for crs to verify that the empirical evidence provided in fact supports the claims .
in this section , at&t's arguments in support of the proposed merger are presented without discussion .
the mobile wireless industry is characterized by economies of scale and scope .
in a dynamic market with rapidly changing technology , however , the claims of scale economies must be weighed against the possibility that any lessening of competition will lessen pressure for innovation and cost and price restraint .
those markets are far smaller than the u.s. market and therefore cannot support as many providers at efficient scale .
it is noteworthy that ( 1 ) the cities where at&t has faced the greatest capacity challenge , new york and san francisco , are global business centers and therefore places that have large numbers of international travelers who are likely to use global voice and data communications ; and ( 2 ) the proposed merger would give deutsche telekom an 8% share of at&t .
in addition to facing significant network scale disadvantages , it would have an increasingly difficult time securing handset arrangements with manufacturers comparable to those of its two dominant rivals .
in a static market , it would be less costly and / or more efficient to build out and operate a single network instead of multiple networks with partially duplicative facilities ; to give a single provider use of a large block of spectrum rather than giving a number of providers use of a subset of that block ; and to design and mass - produce a single suite of handsets rather than making handsets for smaller groups of customers using many different standards and network technologies .
the large u.s. market , on the other hand , could readily accommodate more providers without the loss of scale economies that benefit consumers .
consolidation that gives one or two providers a dominant share of the market and of the available spectrum may promote static efficiency , but it may undermine dynamic efficiency .
the at&t submission makes no mention of the impact of the proposed merger on global competition and barely mentions the enterprise market that serves large ( often multinational or even global ) businesses .
sprint will be depending on clearwire's 4g wimax network as an alternative to the lte networks used by at&t and verizon wireless , but with the dominant carriers deploying lte it will be more difficult to attract the manufacturers and funding needed to develop wimax compatible equipment .
the proposed merger would eliminate this important option for consumers .
 ( sprint / clearwire defensively claim it will be possible to migrate from wimax to lte , if necessary , but that is not proven. ) .
but sprint would be less than half the size of either of its competitors .
both of these facts suggest that the proposed merger might be part of some global market strategy on the part of the two companies .
