these requesters were the speaker of the house ; the house majority leader ; and the chairmen of the house committees on the budget , appropriations , and government reform and oversight .
to do our review , we used the criteria in the results act ; the office of management and budget's ( omb ) guidance on developing the plan ( circular a - 11 , part 2 ) ; our february 1998 guidance for congressional review of the plans ( gao / ggd / aimd 10.1.18 ) ; our evaluator's guidance for assessing annual performance plans ( gao / ggd - 10.1.20 ) ; and the december 17 , 1997 , letter to the omb director from several congressional leaders .
this report provides our observations on the general services administration's ( gsa ) fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan , dated march 5 , 1998 , that was submitted to congress as required by the government performance and results act of 1993 ( results act ) .
although this work will contribute to an overall evaluation of the performance plans submitted by the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers , which will be provided to our congressional requestors , we agreed with key congressional staff that it would be useful to provide further details about our observations to you .
as you know , we were asked by the leadership in the house of representatives to review and evaluate this plan as well as plans developed by other agencies .
where appropriate , we also incorporated findings from our past work and the work of the gsa inspector general ( ig ) .
appendix i contains a compilation of the various types of guidance available for assessing the plan , including the results act , gao reports , and omb documents .
we did our work in march and april 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
second , gsa's performance plan goals are not always linked to the specific program activities and funding in its budget .
on april 9 , 1998 , gsa officials provided oral comments on that draft , which are discussed at the end of this letter .
finally , the performance plan does not adequately discuss its coordination with other agencies on gsa's many crosscutting activities .
first , most of the performance goals and related measures are not quantifiable or results oriented .
gsa's performance plan does not explicitly discuss these factors or their impact on achieving the performance goals .
in its september 1997 strategic plan , gsa identified four external factors — economic conditions , social policy , changes in technology and the marketplace , and legislative framework — that could likely affect its overall performance .
specifically , in developing the next plan , we recommend that the administrator take steps to refine gsa's performance goals to make them more quantifiable and results clarify how gsa's performance goals link to specific program activities in gsa's budget ; explain how gsa has coordinated its crosscutting functions with the discuss gsa strategies to be used and resources needed to achieve its performance goals and their intended results , as well as external factors that could affect its overall performance ; and discuss specific controls for verifying and validating data used to measure performance , recognize existing data limitations , and explain gsa efforts to overcome those limitations .
