this section of the report highlights major bills with asylum provisions that received action in one or both chambers .
the legislative information system ( lis ) listed 83 bills or resolutions with "asylum' in the title or summary that were introduced in the 108 th and 109 th congresses .
some argue further that — since asylum is a discretionary form of immigration relief — national security risks should outweigh humanitarian concerns , and thus asylum relief should be restricted and judicial review of asylum cases more limited .
critics point to asylum seekers from countries of "special concern" ( i.e. , saudi arabia , syria , iran , north korea , china , pakistan , egypt , lebanon , jordan , afghanistan , yemen and somalia ) as potential national security risks .
they argue that the extent to which security risks exist , the risks result more from the limited intelligence data on terrorism , rather than an expansive asylum policy .
some have long been concerned that terrorists would seek asylum in the united states , hoping to remain hidden among the hundreds of thousands of pending asylum cases .
opponents of limiting the judicial review of asylum cases contend that it would erode two traditional values of u.s. polity — the right to due process and freedom from repression and persecution .
some assert further that asylees from countries of "special concern" may be beneficial to u.s. national security because they may have useful information that assists in the war on terrorism , much like assistance provided by communist defectors during the cold war .
although uscis and eoir are clearly the lead agencies in asylum policy , the first contacts many asylum seekers have with the u.s. government are with customs and border protection ( cbp ) inspectors , border patrol officers , and immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) agents , whom some maintain are not adequately trained in asylum policy and other humanitarian forms of immigration relief .
others point out that asylum seekers are subject to multiple national security screenings and that — if an asylum seeker is a suspected or known terrorist — the law already bars alien terrorists .
both nations have a history of repressive governments with documented human rights violations .
u.s. policy toward asylum seekers from cuba and haiti are often discussed in tandem because there are several key points of comparison .
they also question whether there is sufficient communication among the key immigration agencies: cbp , eoir , ice and uscis .
the administration maintains that paroling haitians ( as is typically done for aliens who meet the credible fear threshold ) may encourage other haitians to embark on the risky sea travel and potentially trigger a mass migration from haiti to the united states .
finally , although u.s. immigration law is generally applied neutrally without regard to country of origin , there are special laws and agreements pertaining to cubans and haitians .
haitians interdicted at sea are repatriated , as are cubans ; however , critics charge that haitians who reach the united states are more likely to be detained and less likely to be paroled after the credible fear determination .
they maintain that these cbp officers and ice agents are front line law enforcement who are so geared up to protect against potential terrorists , criminals and other threats that the they may not be flexible enough to recognize bona fide asylum seekers .
