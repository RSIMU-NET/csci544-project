as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to determine whether the sulphur mountain nexrad ( 1 ) can provide timely and accurate information for warning of flash floods and ( 2 ) is intended to provide low - level data necessary to predict wind shear for los angeles international airport .
we have made specific recommendations and testified numerous times over the past several years on these performance problems , developmental problems , and problems relating to cost and schedule .
as a result of its continuing problems , the nws modernization has been included — both in 1995 and 1997 — on our list of high - risk government programs .
ongoing problems — both developmental and operational — have surrounded the modernization .
although nws acknowledges that key problems confront the new systems , it has found that the new radars and satellites have improved forecasts and warnings .
as part of its modernization program , nws plans to reorganize its field office structure from 256 offices ( 52 weather service forecast offices and 204 weather service offices ) , to 121 weather forecast offices ( wfo ) .
four major programs are included in this modernization: nexrad , the automated surface observing system ( asos ) , the next generation geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes - next ) , and the advanced weather interactive processing system ( awips ) .
the goals of the modernization are to achieve more uniform weather services across the nation , improve forecasts , provide better detection and prediction of severe weather and flooding , permit more cost - effective operations through staff and office reductions , and achieve higher productivity .
for example , we have reported that the nexrads have not always been operating when severe weather threatened , and asos has fallen short of performance and user expectations .
nws field offices provide basic weather services such as forecasts , severe weather warnings ( e.g. , tornadoes , flash floods ) , warning preparedness , and , where applicable , aviation and marine forecasts .
warning preparedness includes coordinating with local emergency management , law enforcement agencies , and the media on notification of and response to severe weather events .
in december 1994 , the national weather service ( nws ) began operating a next generation weather radar ( nexrad ) located on sulphur mountain in ventura county , california .
consistent with our 1995 recommendation to correct shortfalls in nexrad system availability,nws headquarters officials told us they are taking steps to improve systems availability .
nexrad , asos , and goes - next — commonly referred to as the observing systems — are operational , while awips is scheduled to be deployed nationwide in june 1999 .
faa uses other systems to perform this mission .
nws began a nationwide modernization program in the 1980s to upgrade observing systems , such as satellites and radars , and design and develop advanced forecaster computer workstations .
the institute concluded , among other things , that the location of the radar prevented it from performing its mission to provide accurate and timely information for warning of flash flooding in nearby communities and wind shear at nearby airports .
given the issues raised by the rose institute , senate report 105-48 requested that we review the findings in the rose institute report .
