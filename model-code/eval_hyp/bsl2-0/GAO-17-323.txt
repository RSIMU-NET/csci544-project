this report assesses ( 1 ) the extent to which the frigate's planned capabilities offer improvements , if any , over the lcs ; and ( 2 ) the navy's plans for the frigate acquisition as well as remaining opportunities for oversight .
the consequences of this approach are well known today — costs to construct the ships have more than doubled from initial expectations , with promised levels of capability unfulfilled and deliveries significantly delayed .
the house armed services committee report on a bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for us to examine the navy's plans for the frigate .
since 2014 , two secretaries of defense have stepped in to address concerns with the combat capability of lcs .
to conduct our work , we reviewed documentation from and interviewed navy and other department of defense ( dod ) officials responsible for overseeing lcs and frigate program management , design , development , acquisition , and testing .
in addition , we leveraged from past gao reports on the lcs program from 2005 through 2016 , as well as from our broader work on navy shipbuilding and acquisition reform initiatives .
this included assessment of plans and activities related to lcs and the frigate .
second , in december 2015 secretary ashton carter , expressing concern that the navy had prioritized ship quantities over delivering combat capability , directed the navy to reduce the total purchase of lcs and frigates from 52 to 40 ships .
acknowledging capability and affordability concerns , the navy — with the secretary of defense's approval — then changed course in late 2014 to pursue an lcs with minor modifications , now called a frigate .
first , secretary chuck hagel questioned the appropriate capability and quantity of the lcs in february 2014 and directed the navy to re - evaluate its small surface combatant capability needs .
in 2018 , the navy plans to select one of the two lcs shipbuilders — referred to as a downselect — to construct the frigate , and will ask congress this year to authorize acquisition plans for 12 frigates and funding for construction of the lead ship .
today , with 28 lcs delivered , under contract , or funded , the navy plans to wind down the lcs program — with the last contract awards expected in 2017 — and pivot to acquisition of the frigate .
to execute the program , the navy deviated from traditional shipbuilding acquisition in hopes of rapidly delivering ships to the fleet .
the ships have interchangeable mission packages carrying equipment for three mission areas — surface warfare , anti - submarine warfare , and mine countermeasures .
unlike other surface combatant programs , lcs consists of two different ship design variants ( called seaframes ) built by two separate shipyards .
details on prior recommendations related to lcs and the frigate that we made in previously issued reports are included in appendix ii .
the navy initially envisioned a revolutionary approach to the littoral combat ship ( lcs ) program .
to ensure sound frigate procurement decisions , congress should consider not enacting authority pursuant to the navy's request for a block buy of 12 frigates in the fiscal year 2018 budget and consider delaying funding of the lead frigate until at least fiscal year 2019 when sufficient cost , design , and capability knowledge is expected to be available to inform decisions .
