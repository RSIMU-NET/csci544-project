in announcing this hearing , you expressed concern about dod's record of executing programs designed to achieve infrastructure savings and the potential impact on readiness accounts if current reform initiatives falter in execution .
in that context , my comments today will focus on the ( 1 ) risks associated with reducing budgets before savings are achieved , ( 2 ) challenges associated with implementing dod's various business process reengineering initiatives , ( 3 ) opportunities to capitalize on consolidation and regionalization opportunities , and ( 4 ) underlying management problems that need to be addressed in implementing the reform initiatives .
these actions are intended to reduce the cost of dod's business and support activities so that operations and maintenance funds can be freed up to support weapons modernization and readiness needs .
specifically , it is proposing to reengineer many of its business processes ; consolidate and reorganize dod's headquarters elements and defense agencies , including the office of the secretary of defense ; increase the use of the office of management and budget ( omb ) a - 76 process to compete dod's commercial activities ; and conduct two additional rounds of base realignment and closures ( brac ) .
these initiatives are described in the defense reform initiative ( dri ) report , which was issued by dod in november 1997 .
dod is attempting to bring about a revolution in its business and support operations by identifying and adopting the best business practices from the private sector .
i am pleased to be here today to present our observations , based on past and ongoing work , on the department of defense's ( dod ) latest reform initiatives .
before discussing my specific observations , i would like to briefly summarize my key points .
although dod is currently not targeting savings from business process reengineering initiatives for similar out - year budget reductions , dod will still need efficiencies from these initiatives to meet its planned personnel reductions targets .
however , these initiatives , most of which have been ongoing for some time , still face implementation challenges .
consequently , reducing out - year budgets before savings are more clearly known increases the risk that operating units and field commanders will not have sufficient funds to meet their readiness needs .
overall , we are encouraged that dod has embraced the concept of reengineering to streamline its business practices and processes and believe many of the initiatives have promise .
dod's travel reengineering and prime vendor programs are both good examples of areas where significant progress has been made but opportunities still exist if organizational and cultural barriers can be overcome .
in past reform initiatives , dod took the savings from future year budgets .
our past work has shown that a - 76 competitions and base closures produced savings , but they may not have been as great or materialized as quickly as dod initially estimated .
dod is planning to reduce out - year operations and maintenance budgets in anticipation of the savings that will accrue from the dris .
although total costs have not been finalized , we have been able to identify funding needs exceeding $600 million for tav and its supporting initiatives .
