 ( 2 ) how will the safety , the security , and the efficiency of the national airspace system be affected if airports' year 2000 preparations are not completed in time ? .
and ( 3 ) what factors affect the progress of airports' preparations for the year 2000 ? .
specifically , we agreed to address the following: ( 1 ) what is the status of airports' efforts to help ensure that their computers and electronic equipment will function properly on and after january 1 , 2000 ? .
this equipment helps provide safe , secure , and efficient aircraft operations and other services to the public ; it includes controls for such functions as lighting runways , monitoring access to secured areas , handling baggage , and fueling aircraft .
they do not include such other critical functions in the nation's air transportation system as the air traffic control system operated by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) or the operations and the maintenance of aircraft and other equipment owned or operated by the nation's airlines .
this report responds to your request to examine the status of airports' efforts to prepare for the year 2000 and to help ensure that the equipment supporting the functions needed for the safe and efficient operation of our nation's airports will be ready .
this questionnaire focused on airports' preparations to help ensure essential operations continue through and after the year 2000 .
because the software and hardware components used to control airport equipment may not be able to distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000 , this equipment may malfunction when the date changes from 1999 to 2000 .
the successful operation of the national airspace system — the network supporting u.s. aviation operations that includes navigation facilities , airports , equipment , services , and information and rules — is dependent , in part , on the equipment , including computers , that airports use to carry out their operations .
the operations we examined in this review include those under the control , in whole or in part , of the nation's airports .
airports are making progress in their efforts to prepare for the year 2000 , but their efforts vary considerably .
our primary method of data collection for this report was a questionnaire we mailed to 413 airports owned by local municipalities , states , and regional or independent authorities .
as of december 1998 , we obtained responses from 334 airports ( 81 percent ) , which represent about 96 percent of the passengers that were served by u.s. airports in 1996 .
moreover , many airports lack some or all of the chief components of a structured approach to year 2000 repairs , which is most likely to ensure success .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) has set milestones of september 1998 , january 1999 , and march 1999 , respectively , for federal agencies to complete renovating , testing , and implementing their systems .
faa has announced it will complete its preparations by june 30 , 1999 , and has recommended the same date to airports as the deadline for either ( 1 ) completing the process of ensuring that all their equipment supporting the core functions related to safety is year 2000 ready or ( 2 ) implementing contingency plans to ensure the continuation of these functions .
