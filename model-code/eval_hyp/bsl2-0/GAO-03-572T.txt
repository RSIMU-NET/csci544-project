for example , the department of the treasury's internal revenue service ( irs ) has made significant progress in addressing its financial management weaknesses , including addressing controls over budgetary activity and its accountability over property and equipment .
a number of federal agencies have started to make progress in their efforts to modernize their financial management systems and improve financial management performance as called for in the president's management agenda .
until the problems discussed in our report are adequately addressed , they will continue to ( 1 ) hamper the federal government's ability to accurately report a significant portion of its assets , liabilities , and costs , ( 2 ) affect the federal government's ability to accurately measure the full cost and financial performance of certain programs and effectively manage related operations , and ( 3 ) significantly impair the federal government's ability to adequately safeguard certain significant assets and properly record various transactions .
across government , financial management improvement initiatives are under way that , if effectively implemented , have the potential to appreciably improve the quality of the federal government's financial management and reporting .
resolving many of irs's most serious financial management weaknesses — identified by gao as a high - risk area since 1995 — will require a sustained , long - term commitment of resources , continued strong involvement of senior irs management , and sustained progress in systems modernization .
for the first time , chief financial officers act ( cfo ) act agencies were required to combine their audited financial statements with performance reports and deliver both to the office of management and budget ( omb ) by february 1 , a month earlier than last year .
the social security administration ( ssa ) , which has a long - standing record of delivering its audited financial statements well before the mandated deadline , issued its fiscal year 2002 audited financial statements on november 19 , 2002 .
treasury also accelerated its time frame and issued its fiscal year 2002 audited financial statements on november 15 , 2002 , which was more than 3 months earlier than for fiscal year 2001 .
as a result , many federal agencies must accelerate their efforts to improve underlying financial management systems and controls , which is consistent with reaching the financial management success measures envisioned by the jfmip principals and called for by the president's management agenda .
the continued involvement of this subcommittee will be critical to ultimately restoring public confidence in the federal government as a financial steward that is accountable for its finances .
the work of the former subcommittee on government efficiency , financial management , and intergovernmental relations , along with its leader , former congressman stephen horn , has been a catalyst to facilitate government management reform over the past 6 years .
furthermore , the principals of the joint financial management improvement program ( jfmip ) — the secretary of the treasury , the directors of omb and the office of personnel management ( opm ) , and i , as comptroller general of the united states — have agreed to accelerate the agency financial statement reporting date to november 15 for fiscal year 2004 .
it will be increasingly difficult for federal agencies to continue to rely on significant costly and time - intensive manual efforts to achieve or maintain unqualified opinions until automated , integrated processes and systems are implemented that readily produce the necessary information .
