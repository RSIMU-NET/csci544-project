in response , the eu and united states have imposed strengthened sanctions against key belarusian leaders , businessmen , and firms .
russia has taken advantage of this situation to increase its political and economic influence in belarus .
relations between belarus and the united states have been particularly poor since lukashenko's brutal repression of the opposition after fraudulent presidential elections in december 2010 .
another concern is belarus's support for pariah regimes , including through arms sales .
those advocating a stronger u.s. role in trying to bring democratic change to belarus say that the country is important to the united states because belarus is an obstacle to the u.s. goal of making europe "whole and free. .
his regime is in rhetoric and policies a throwback to the soviet era .
belarusian president aleksandr lukashenko snuffed out belarus's modest progress toward democracy and a free market economy and created an authoritarian regime shortly after being elected as president in 1994 .
there has been some debate among policy analysts in belarus , the united states , and europe about whether the current sanctions policy against belarus is effective or even in some respects counterproductive .
he dominates the belarusian political scene , controlling the parliament , government , security services , and judiciary through a large presidential administration and substantial extra - budgetary resources .
on the other hand , experts in the united states and europe who are concerned about russian efforts to strengthen its sphere of influence in the region warn that by isolating belarus , the eu and united states are playing into moscow's hands , without achieving real gains on democratization .
the opposition's weakness is in part due to the regime's repression , but divisions over ideology and the conflicting personal ambitions of its leaders have also been factors .
belarus's cooperation with nato has been limited in most respects .
he has reduced potential threats from within his regime by frequently removing or transferring officials at all levels , often claiming they are incompetent or corrupt .
lukashenko was first elected as president of belarus in 1994 on a populist , anti - corruption platform .
opposition groups and leaders in belarus have so far posed little threat to the lukashenko regime .
the regime forced the closure of independent media and non - governmental organizations ( ngos ) dealing with political issues and human rights .
belarus strongly opposed nato enlargement to include neighboring central european countries .
lukashenko also appears to have succeeded in convincing some belarusians , especially in the countryside , that his leadership has provided them with stable ( if very modest ) living standards and public order , in contrast to the vast disparities in wealth and rampant criminality prevalent in neighboring russia .
russian efforts to secure control of key belarusian assets , such as belaruskali and oil refineries , are likely .
supporters , including some belarusian opposition leaders , credit them with being responsible for their liberation from prison .
former regime figures who move into opposition are singled out for particularly harsh punishment .
however , some belarusian opposition figures also criticize the sanctions for being largely symbolic in character , given that they permit the regime to continue to do highly lucrative business in the eu and elsewhere .
