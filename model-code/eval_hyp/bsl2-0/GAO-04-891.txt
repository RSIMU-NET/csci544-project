specifically , this report provides federal officials' and stakeholders' views on ( 1 ) whether the privatization steps required by the orbit act have been implemented and whether there were potential inconsistencies between orbit act requirements and u.s. obligations made in international trade agreements ; ( 2 ) whether access by global satellite companies to non - u.s. markets has improved since the enactment of the orbit act and , if so , to what is this generally attributed ; and ( 3 ) if any market access problems remain , what role does the federal communications commission ( fcc ) have in addressing those problems under the orbit act .
in 2000 , the congress passed the open - market reorganization for the betterment of international telecommunications act ( orbit act ) to help promote a more competitive global satellite communication services market .
the orbit act called for the full privatization of intelsat and imposed certain criteria on the nature of intelsat's privatization .
you asked us to provide information related to the implementation of the orbit act and the status of market access for global satellite companies in countries around the world .
ustr has received no complaints about access problems by satellite companies in non - u.s. markets in either their annual review of compliance with telecommunications trade agreements , or in comments solicited in the context of ongoing wto services negotiations .
we also interviewed officials from fcc ; the united states trade representative ( ustr ) ; the department of state ; the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) ; and the international telecommunications satellite organization , an intergovernmental entity formed when intelsat privatized that works to ensure that satellite service is available to countries that might not otherwise have access to such services .
in addition , you asked us to provide information related to the tax status of intelsat prior to privatization as well as the current tax treatment of multinational corporations .
at about the same time , decision - makers within intelsat began to believe that its intergovernmental structure led to a slow decision - making process that did not enable intelsat to be sufficiently nimble in the increasingly dynamic global communications marketplace .
additionally , fcc told us that broad market access concerns are most appropriately handled by ustr through the wto .
we also reviewed key documents , including relevant provisions of the communications satellite and orbit acts , and other relevant documents obtained from fcc , ustr , and ntia about the orbit act and related concerns about market access in non - u.s. markets .
during the 1990s , there was considerable criticism from new commercial satellite companies focused on the difficulty of competing against a company with the advantages that flowed from intelsat's intergovernmental status .
certain other companies , experts , and fcc told us that nothing to date has occurred that would require additional fcc actions regarding the implementation of the orbit act .
we interviewed five satellite service providers and six scholars and attorneys who specialize in the regulatory and market access issues related to satellite communications .
due to its intergovernmental nature , intelsat benefited from many privileges that privately owned companies do not enjoy .
while some comments filed with fcc in proceedings on intelsat's licensing and for fcc's annual report on the orbit act raise concerns about market access , fcc has stated that these filings amount only to general allegations and fall short of alleging any specific statutory violation that would form a basis sufficient to trigger an fcc enforcement action .
