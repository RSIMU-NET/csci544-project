the surveys were performed pursuant to projects sponsored by the congressional research service ( crs ) .
there are thousands of such officials , many of whom are responsible for all aspects of election administration in their local jurisdictions — including voter registration , recruiting pollworkers , running each election , and choosing and purchasing new voting systems .

some issues that may be relevant for congressional deliberations are highlighted below .
the surveys were administered following the 2004 , 2006 , and 2008 federal elections .

the areas of concern expressed by leos — such as how to meet the costs of ongoing implementation of hava requirements — raise issues that congress may wish to address as it considers hava appropriations and reauthorization .
