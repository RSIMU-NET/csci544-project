specifically , this report addresses the ( 1 ) cost of cleanup efforts , ( 2 ) reasons that cleanups are so costly , and ( 3 ) potential opportunities for reducing costs and their impact on programmatic goals .
as requested , we reviewed the cost of the department of defense's ( dod ) environmental cleanup efforts at bases being closed under the base realignment and closure ( brac ) process .
the options we analyzed are ( 1 ) deferring or extending certain cleanup actions , ( 2 ) modifying existing laws and regulations , ( 3 ) adopting more cost - effective cleanup technologies , and ( 4 ) sharing costs with transferees .
through march 1996 , dod had allocated $3.4 billion , obligated $2.8 billion , and expended $1.6 billion on brac environmental cleanup .
although $3.4 billion had been allocated for brac environmental cleanup through march 1996 , it is likely that costs will exceed $11 billion before cleanups are completed well into the next century .
in the earlier years of the brac program , the congress had expressed concern about dod's slow progress in obligating funds for environmental cleanup .
among these factors are ( 1 ) the large number of contaminated sites and associated extent of contamination , ( 2 ) the requirements of federal and state environmental laws and regulations , ( 3 ) the lack of cost - effective cleanup technology , and ( 4 ) property reuse plans .
the estimated cost for the brac environmental cleanup program is uncertain but will be much higher than amounts allocated thus far .
no such restriction has been enacted for the brac program .
potential options exist for reducing the cost of cleanup .
second , newer technology may not be more cost - effective than existing technology .
dod officials told us that cost estimates for these bases would likely increase as additional environmental studies are performed , more work is identified , and cleanup timelines are accelerated .
in recent years , dod has significantly increased the rate at which it has obligated environmental funds for the brac program .
available dod data indicate , for example , that cleanup costs for 27 closing bases will likely exceed $100 million each .
our analysis shows that in recent years dod has greatly increased the rate at which it has obligated funds .
the cleanup of contaminated base property has been costly , and with the majority of base cleanup work still to be done , costs will continue to grow .
however , although new technologies may offer significant cost reduction potential , there are programmatic tradeoffs or risks involved with awaiting for the emergence of more cost - effective technology .
due in large part to heightened congressional interest in the issue , however , dod made a concerted effort to increase obligations .
they said more gains could be made by improving and refining cleanup standards and existing technologies .
further , environmental laws and regulations vary by state and often have more stringent requirements that tend to increase cost .
rather , we are presenting them in the context of tradeoffs they represent so that congressional and defense decisionmakers have the information for their consideration as they explore ways to reduce program costs while achieving environmental cleanup goals .
