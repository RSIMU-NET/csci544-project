as reported to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , federal agencies plan to spend at least $82 billion on it in fiscal year 2014 .
however , as we have previously reported and testified , federal it projects too frequently fail and incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission - related outcomes .
in those reports , we made numerous recommendations to federal agencies and omb to further enhance the management and oversight of it programs .
given the scale of such planned outlays and the criticality of many of these systems to the health , economy , and security of the nation , it is important that omb and federal agencies provide appropriate oversight and transparency into these programs and avoid duplicative investments , whenever possible , to ensure the most efficient use of resources .
during the past several years , we have issued multiple reports and testimonies on best practices for major acquisitions and federal initiatives to acquire and improve the management of it investments .
as discussed with subcommittee staff , i am testifying today on the results and recommendations from our selected reports on how best practices and it reform initiatives can help federal agencies better manage major acquisitions and legacy investments .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss how best practices and major information technology ( it ) reform initiatives can help the federal government better acquire and manage it investments .
all work on which this testimony is based was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards or all sections of gao's quality assurance framework that were relevant to our objectives .
those standards and the framework require that we plan and perform our audits and engagements to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives ; the framework also requires that we discuss any limitations in our work .
in summary , omb's and agencies' recent efforts have resulted in greater transparency and oversight of federal spending , but continued leadership and attention are necessary to build on the progress that has been made .
further , agencies should conduct additional techstat reviews to focus management attention on troubled projects and establish clear action items to turn the projects around or terminate them .
additionally , federal agencies need to continue to improve the accuracy and availability of information on the dashboard to provide greater transparency and even more attention to the billions of dollars invested in troubled projects .
in addition , we made several recommendations to improve agencies' implementation of portfoliostat requirements .
however , we concluded that selected omb efforts could be strengthened to improve the portfoliostat initiative and ensure agencies achieve identified cost savings , including addressing issues related to existing cio authority at federal agencies , and publicly reporting on agency - provided data .
a more detailed discussion of the objectives , scope , and methodology of this work is included in each of the reports on which this testimony is based .
we recommended , among other things , that omb require agencies to fully disclose limitations with respect to cio authority .
with the possibility of over $5.8 billion in savings from the data center consolidation and portfoliostat initiatives , agencies should continue to identify consolidation opportunities in both data centers and commodity it .
