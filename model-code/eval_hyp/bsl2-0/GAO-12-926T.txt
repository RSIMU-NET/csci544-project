along with these anticipated benefits , however , cybersecurity and industry experts have expressed concern that , if not implemented securely , modernized electricity grid systems will be vulnerable to attacks that could result in widespread loss of electrical services essential to maintaining our national economy and security .
in my testimony today , i will describe ( 1 ) cyber threats facing cyber - reliant critical infrastructures , which include the electricity grid , and ( 2 ) actions taken and challenges remaining to secure the grid against cyber attacks .
this use of it can provide many benefits , such as greater efficiency and lower costs to consumers .
in addition , since 2003 we have identified protecting systems supporting our nation's critical infrastructure ( which includes the electricity grid ) as a governmentwide high - risk area , and we continue to do so in the most recent update to our high - risk list .
as you know , the electric power industry is increasingly incorporating information technology ( it ) systems and networks into its existing infrastructure ( e.g. , electricity networks including power lines and customer meters ) .
in preparing this statement in july 2012 , we relied on our previous work in this area , including studies examining efforts to secure the electricity grid and associated challenges and cybersecurity guidance .
 ( please see the related gao products in appendix i. ) .
we also reviewed documents from the federal energy regulatory commission , the north american electric reliability corporation , the department of energy , including its office of the inspector general , and the department of homeland security industrial control systems cyber emergency response team , as well as publicly available reports on cyber incidents .
although ferc agreed with these recommendations , they have not yet been implemented .
thank you for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing on the status of actions to protect the electricity grid from cyber attacks .
ferc agreed with these recommendations .
the roles of nerc and ferc remain critical in approving and disseminating cybersecurity guidance and enforcing standards , as appropriate .
to improve coordination among regulators and help congress better assess the effectiveness of the voluntary smart grid standards process , we recommended that the chairman of ferc develop an approach to coordinate with state regulators and with groups that represent utilities subject to less ferc and state regulation to ( 1 ) periodically evaluate the extent to which utilities and manufacturers are following voluntary interoperability and cybersecurity standards and ( 2 ) develop strategies for addressing any gaps in compliance with standards that are identified as a result of this evaluation .
consequently , unless steps are taken to mitigate these challenges , regulations may not be fully effective in protecting smart grid technology from cybersecurity threats .
nerc has assessed monetary penalties for violations of its cyber security standards .
utilities were focusing on regulatory compliance instead of comprehensive security .
the products upon which this statement is based contain detailed overviews of the scope of our reviews and the methodology we used .
we will continue to monitor the status of its efforts to address these recommendations .
we also recommended that ferc , working with nerc as appropriate , assess whether commission efforts should address any of the cybersecurity challenges identified in our report .
