many of these reports and testimonies described serious weaknesses in usda's management of its civil rights programs — in particular , weaknesses in providing minorities with access to usda programs and in resolving discrimination complaints .
in addition , the 2002 farm bill and subsequent legislation require usda to report annually on minority participation in usda programs .
equal employment opportunity commission , usda's office of inspector general ( oig ) , gao , and others have described extensive concerns about discriminatory behavior in usda's delivery of services to program customers — in particular , minority farmers — and its treatment of minority employees .
furthermore , without better strategic planning and meaningful performance measures , it appears unlikely that usda management will be fully effective in achieving its civil rights mission .
for decades , usda has been the focus of federal inquiries into allegations of discrimination against minorities and women both in the programs it administers and in its workforce .
the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 ( 2002 farm bill ) authorized the secretary of agriculture to create the new position of assistant secretary for civil rights , elevating responsibility within usda for carrying out usda's civil rights efforts .
i will focus my testimony today on three primary issues: ascr's ( 1 ) resolution of discrimination complaints , ( 2 ) reporting on minority participation in usda programs , and ( 3 ) strategic planning for ensuring usda's services and benefits are provided fairly and equitably .
usda has been addressing allegations of discrimination for decades and receiving recommendations for improving its civil rights functions without achieving fundamental improvements .
the new administration has indicated its commitment to improve the management of civil rights at usda .
under the 2002 farm bill , the secretary may delegate responsibility to the assistant secretary for civil rights for ensuring that usda complies with all civil rights - related laws and considers civil rights matters in all usda strategic planning initiatives .
for example , the pigford v. glickman case has resulted in the payment of about $1 billion in claims to african - american farmers .
given the new administration's commitment to giving priority attention to usda's civil rights problems , various options may provide a road map to correcting long - standing management deficiencies that have given rise to these problems .
numerous reports and congressional testimony by officials of the u.s. commission on civil rights , the u.s .
while ascr's established policy is to fairly and efficiently respond to complaints of discrimination , its efforts to establish the management system necessary to implement the policy have fallen short , and significant deficiencies remain .
in addition , unless usda obtains accurate data on minority participation in usda programs , its reports on improving minority participation in usda programs will not be reliable or useful .
in addition , usda has been the subject of several large class - action lawsuits claiming discriminatory behavior on the part of the department .
one lawsuit has cost taxpayers about a billion dollars in payouts to date , and several other groups are seeking redress for similar alleged discrimination .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) progress in addressing long - standing civil rights issues .
