in its discussion of strategies for aviation security , the 9 / 11 commission recommended that: the tsa [transportation security administration] and the congress must give priority attention to improving the ability of screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers .
108-458 within seven days of passage and would establish a checkpoint screening security fund , paid for with fees on airline passengers , to develop and deploy equipment for explosives detection at screening checkpoints .
it also required that passengers who are selected for additional screening be screened for explosives , as an interim measure until all passengers can be screened for explosives .
this report discusses the current state of passenger explosives trace detection and related policy issues .
as a start , each individual selected for special screening should be screened for explosives .
organizational challenges include deciding where and how detectors are used , projecting costs , and developing technical and regulatory standards .
some versions could simultaneously detect other threats , such as nonmetallic weapons .
operational challenges include maximizing passenger throughput , responding to erroneous and innocuous detections , ensuring passenger acceptance of new procedures , minimizing the potential for intentional disruption of the screening process , and providing for research and development into future generations of detection equipment , including techniques for detecting novel explosives .
any strategy for deploying and operating passenger explosives detection portals must consider a number of challenges .
the dhs and its predecessor agencies have historically been the main funders of research on explosives detection for airport use .
several other federal agencies , however , also fund research related to trace explosives detection .
however , many of the policy issues discussed below would apply similarly to bulk detection equipment .
explosives detection for aviation security has been an area of federal concern for many years .
 ( most of this research has focused on detecting explosives in baggage rather than on passengers. ) .
current deployments for passenger screening are focused on trace detection , and the remainder of this report does not discuss bulk detection .
for security reasons , many technical details of equipment performance are not publicly available , which makes independent analysis of technical performance challenging .
