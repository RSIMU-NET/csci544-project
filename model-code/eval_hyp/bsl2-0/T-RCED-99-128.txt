these problems have caused us to include the program on our list of federal programs vulnerable to waste and abuse .
despite the progress that superfund has made toward site cleanups , certain management problems persist .
my comments today are based on a number of reports we have issued in recent years that relate to three specific issues: ( 1 ) progress made toward cleaning up sites in the program , ( 2 ) continuing management problems , and ( 3 ) factors affecting superfund's future workload .
there is considerable uncertainty about the future workload of the superfund program .
the number of sites that have entered the superfund program in recent years has decreased as epa has focused its resources on completing work at existing sites and the states have developed their own programs for cleaning up sites .
these problems include the difficulty in controlling contract costs , the failure to recover certain federal cleanup costs from the parties who are responsible for the contaminated sites , and the selection of sites for cleanup without assurance that they are the most dangerous sites to human health and the environment .
resolving this uncertainty depends largely on deciding how to divide responsibility for the cleanup of sites between epa and the states .
furthermore , our analysis indicates that the costs of on - site work by cleanup contractors represent less than half of the spending in the program .
decisions about how to clean up the great majority of these sites have been made , and the construction of cleanup remedies has been completed at over 40 percent of the sites .
work to clean up groundwater will continue at many sites after remedies are constructed .
epa's goal is to complete the construction of remedies at 1,200 sites by 2005 .
in summary , our work has shown the following: in the past , we have called attention to the slow pace of cleanups in the superfund program .
however , now , 17 years after sites were first placed on the superfund list , many of the sites have progressed a considerable distance through the cleanup process .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the current status and management of the superfund program and the outlook for the program's future .
the superfund reauthorization process gives the congress an opportunity to help guide epa and the states in allocating responsibility for addressing these sites .
for example , we reported that cleanups completed in 1996 took an average of over 10 years .
however , according to epa and state officials who responded to our survey , a large number of sites in epa's inventory of potential superfund sites are contaminating groundwater and drinking water sources and causing other problems and may need cleanup .
we have recommended that epa work with the states to assign responsibility for these sites among themselves .
we included superfund on the list because of ( 1 ) problems with the management of cleanup contractors , ( 2 ) insufficient recovery of cleanup costs from responsible parties , and ( 3 ) the absence of risk - based priorities for site cleanups .
for several years , gao has included the superfund program on its list of federal programs that pose significant financial risk to the government and the potential for waste and abuse .
