my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) the challenges in ensuring adequate supply to meet demand for vaccine and ( 2 ) the mechanisms in place to target high - risk populations when , as happened this year , a vaccine shortage occurs .
this year's loss of roughly half of the country's supply of flu vaccine highlighted what has become a growing problem â€” the fragility of the vaccine production and distribution system .
we have been monitoring this issue for a number of years , and we are starting new work for the house committee on government reform to analyze this year's situation in greater detail .
our prior work on flu vaccine included analysis of information provided by and interviews with department of health and human services ( hhs ) officials , vaccine manufacturers , medical distributors and their trade associations , companies that provide flu vaccinations at retail outlets and work sites , physician and other professional associations , and other purchasers .
in september and november 2004 we updated this work with analysis of information provided by centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) officials , one major manufacturer , and other sources .
we obtained information on ( 1 ) the available doses and demand for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 flu seasons , ( 2 ) the status of this year's flu vaccine , and ( 3 ) cdc activities , including actions taken following the announcement that one major manufacturer could not supply any vaccine for the u.s. market this year .
when shortages occur , their effect can be exacerbated by the existing distribution system .
in summary , the current situation demonstrates the challenges of ensuring an adequate and timely flu vaccine supply .
only three manufacturers produce flu vaccine for the u.s. market , and the potential for future manufacturing problems such as those experienced both this year and to a lesser degree in previous years is still present .
my remarks are based on reports and testimony we have issued since may 2001 as well as work conducted to update key information .
problems have not been totally averted , however , as there have been media reports of long lines to obtain limited doses of vaccine and of high - risk individuals unable to find a flu vaccination in a timely fashion .
the current situation also reflects another concern: the nation lacks a systematic approach for ensuring that seniors and others at high risk for flu - related complications receive flu vaccine when it is in short supply .
cdc is responding by working with the remaining major flu vaccine manufacturer and states and local public health agencies to better target high - risk populations .
we also surveyed physician group practices and interviewed health department officials in all 50 states about their experiences in the 2000- 2001 flu season .
once this year's shortage became apparent , cdc took a number of steps to influence distribution patterns to help providers get some vaccine for their high - risk patients .
infectious disease outbreaks: bioterrorism preparedness efforts have improved public health response capacity , but gaps remain .
under this system , health providers and vaccine distributors generally order a particular manufacturer's vaccine and have limited recourse , even for meeting the needs of high - risk persons , if that manufacturer's production is adversely affected .
