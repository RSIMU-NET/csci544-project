according to the department of energy ( doe ) , in fiscal year 2017 , the government spent about $6 billion on energy for roughly 3.2 billion square feet of buildings and facilities , with the department of defense ( dod ) accounting for over half of that spending .
by statute , the general services administration ( gsa ) has primary authority for entering into energy contracts for federal agencies .
 ( matter for consideration 1 ) .
this report examines ( 1 ) potential limiting factors for federal energy purchases from tribal sources , and suggestions for addressing them , that federal officials , tribal representatives , and stakeholders have identified ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which gsa , dod , and doe have used the tribal energy preference to meet federal energy needs .
for example , the act provides for federal grants , loans , and technical assistance to tribes and tribal energy resource development organizations to carry out energy projects and to process , use , or develop tribal energy resources .
to the extent that congress wants to further encourage federal agencies to use tribal energy sources , it should consider amending the energy policy act of 2005 to provide more specific direction to federal agencies for implementing the tribal energy preference , to include consideration of additional incentives or requirements to use these energy sources .
however , tribes pursuing utility - scale projects need a customer to purchase their power for such projects to be economically feasible .
furthermore , epact05 authorizes federal agencies and departments to meet their own considerable energy needs by giving preference to majority tribally owned energy suppliers , with certain requirements , and provides an incentive for using renewable energy produced on tribal lands .
these lands also have resources with significant potential for the development of renewable energy , such as wind , solar , geothermal , and biomass .
you asked us to provide information on federal energy purchases from tribes and federal agency efforts to implement the tribal energy preference .
tribes may seek opportunities to use these resources to provide revenue for their government operations and social service programs , create high - quality jobs , and increase access to reliable and affordable energy for tribal buildings and individual homes .
in a 2016 law , congress noted that “through treaties , statutes , and historical relations with indian tribes , the united states has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support indian tribes and indians.” the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact05 ) includes several mechanisms that can support tribes in developing their energy resources .
gsa has delegated this authority to dod and doe so that they may also enter into energy contracts .
tribal lands have considerable mineral energy resources , such as oil , gas , and coal .
however , we found in november 2016 that no agencies had used the tribal energy preference , partly because no government - wide guidance existed on when and how federal agencies should use the preference .
tribes are also developing renewable energy projects that range from facility - and community - scale production , such as rooftop solar panels or a wind turbine to power a community center , to utility - scale production of hundreds of megawatts of electricity .
