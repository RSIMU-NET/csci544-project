the first , nutrition monitoring: progress in developing a coordinated program ( gao / pemd - 94-23 ) , assessed the nnmrrp's planning activities .
the second , nutrition monitoring: data serve many purposes ; users recommend improvements ( gao / pemd - 95-15 ) , surveyed users of nutrition monitoring data about how the data are used and what changes are needed to the data collection activities .
this report describes features of a model nutrition monitoring system and presents the strengths and limitations of various strategies for achieving four of the model features .
this report responds to your request that we identify features of a model nutrition monitoring system and examine approaches to incorporating those features in the national nutrition monitoring and related research program ( nnmrrp ) .
it builds on two earlier reports .
as arranged with your office , we will be sending copies of this report to the director of the office of management and budget , the interagency board for nutrition monitoring and related research , the agencies responsible for data collection , and interested congressional committees .
we will also make copies available to others upon request .
the major contributors to this report are listed in appendix v. if you have any questions or would like additional information , please call me at ( 202 ) 512-3092 .
over time , the nnmrrp has developed activities focused on five content areas: ( 1 ) food and nutrient consumption ; ( 2 ) nutritional and health status ; ( 3 ) dietary knowledge , attitudes , and behavior ; ( 4 ) food composition ; and ( 5 ) food supply .
although the united states has one of the most comprehensive monitoring programs in the world , several problems with nutrition monitoring activities have been identified over the past two decades .
of key concern has been the lack of coordination and compatibility of different data collection activities .
table 1.2 lists specific activities managed by the departments of agriculture and health and human services , which have major responsibilities for the five areas .
to improve the coordination of federal nutrition monitoring activities and the quality of the data collected , the congress passed the national nutrition monitoring and related research act of 1990 ( p.l .
this encompasses differences across surveys in methods for assessing dietary intake and nutritional status , sampling designs , population descriptors and other measures , and the timing and reporting of results .
101-445 ) .
as shown in table 1.1 , the information produced by these activities is used for a variety of purposes , from supporting basic research on human nutritional needs to informing policy decisions about health , agriculture , and food programs .
other agencies , including commerce , defense , and the environmental protection agency , also participate in the nnmrrp .
the activities are organized around six objectives , which are to • provide for a comprehensive nnmrrp through continuous and coordinated data collection ; improve the comparability and quality of data across the nnmrrp ; improve the research base for nutrition monitoring ; • develop and strengthen state and local capacity for continuous and coordinated nutrition monitoring data collection that complements national nutrition surveys ; improve methodologies to enhance comparability of nnmrrp data across federal , state , and local levels ; and improve the quality of state and local nutrition monitoring data .
