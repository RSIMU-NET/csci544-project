the united states has provided funds for cyclone nargis emergency response and recovery activities largely through un agencies and international nongovernmental organizations ( ngo ) .
the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) has funded most of the u.s. response and recovery activities .
the department of defense ( dod ) provided emergency supplies , direct air transport , and logistics support .
the u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) implements many elements of the sanctions program , including the prohibitions on exports of financial services to burma and the targeted financial prohibitions .
to address the mandate , in this report we ( 1 ) describe the assistance un and u.s. agencies have provided in response to cyclone nargis , ( 2 ) assess usaid actions to help ensure funds are used as intended and do not benefit sanctioned entities , and ( 3 ) describe the challenges responders experienced and the lessons learned .
the u.s. department of state ( state ) played a role in coordinating and monitoring the u.s. government response .
the sanctions arise from actions and policies by the burmese military government that repress the democratic opposition in burma .
the burmese military government initially blocked most international access to the affected region ; however , amidst international pressure , it slowly began allowing aid to be delivered throughout may 2008 and finally allowed international aid workers into the cyclone - affected delta by late may 2008 .
in response , un ocha reports that the international community mobilized more than $600 million in aid as of may 2011 , including $334.8 million from u.s. and un agencies .
in 1997 , the united states prohibited new investment in burma and has since imposed broad sanctions to prohibit the exportation of financial services to burma , certain imports from burma , and transactions with senior burmese officials and others , and has provided limited assistance to burma .
to address these objectives , we reviewed financial and program documents from usaid , dod , state , treasury , un agencies , and ngos .
congressional committees mandated that we assess the assistance that the united states provided in response to the cyclone .
cyclone nargis hit burma's impoverished irrawaddy delta on may 2 , 2008 , leaving nearly 140,000 people dead or missing and severely affecting about 2.4 million others , according to the united nations ( un ) office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( un ocha ) .
we also met with officials from these three ngos and with usaid officials responsible for financial oversight of the ngos' programs .
we also conducted a limited internal controls review of three ngos , which collectively account for 66 percent of funding that usaid awarded to international ngos to respond to cyclone nargis .
to address the second objective , we reviewed program and financial files for funds usaid awarded in response to cyclone nargis and spoke with usaid officials about their monitoring of programs .
we also interviewed u.s. , un , and ngo officials in washington , d.c. ; bangkok , thailand ; and rangoon , burma ; and conducted site visits to select usaid - funded recovery projects in burma .
to address the third objective , we reviewed 16 relevant after - action and assessment reports prepared by the u.s. government , un agencies , and ngos to identify challenges experienced during the cyclone nargis response , as well as lessons learned .
