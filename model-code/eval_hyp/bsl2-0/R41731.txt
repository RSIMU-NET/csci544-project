although more than seven years have passed since congress first appropriated funding for the initiative , central america continues to face significant security challenges .
since fy2008 , congress has appropriated nearly $1.2 billion for the seven nations of central america through the mérida initiative and carsi .
as congress evaluates budget priorities and considers additional assistance for the region , it may examine the scope of the security challenges in central america , the current efforts being undertaken by the governments of central america to address those challenges , and how the united states has supported central american efforts .
this report provides background information about these topics and raises potential policy issues regarding u.s. - central america security cooperation that congress may opt to consider , such as the strategy and funding levels necessary to achieve u.s. objectives , how best to promote and protect human rights , and how u.s. domestic policies impact security conditions in the region .
while it continues to support immediate law enforcement and interdiction operations , it also aims to strengthen the capacities of communities and governmental institutions to address security challenges and the underlying conditions that contribute to them .
during the 1980s , u.s. economic and military assistance to central america averaged nearly $1.4 billion ( inflation - adjusted 2013 dollars ) annually to prevent potential soviet allies from establishing political or military footholds in the region .
whereas most u.s. security efforts in central america since the 1990s have focused on preventing illicit narcotics from reaching the united states , carsi is designed to address a broader array of security concerns .
in fy2010 , congress and the obama administration re - launched the central america portion of the mérida initiative as the central america regional security initiative ( carsi ) .
u.s. security assistance to the region did not increase substantially until fy2008 with the introduction of the mérida initiative , a counterdrug and anticrime assistance program that focused primarily on mexico but also included some funding for central america .
the u.s. government continued to provide central american nations with some assistance for narcotics interdiction and institutional capacity building , but the funding levels were comparatively low .
crime and violence also take an economic toll on the countries of the region , which is estimated to range from 2.5% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in costa rica to 10.5% of gdp in honduras .
while some analysts argue that the growth of organized crime in central america poses challenges to u.s. strategic interests and may present a greater threat to regional security than the civil conflicts of the 1980s , u.s. policymakers have only recently begun to offer increased attention and financial support to the region .
citizens of those nations now rank crime as the top problem facing their countries , and an increasing number have sought refuge abroad .
u.s. attention to the region declined significantly in the early 1990s , however , as the civil wars ended and cold war concerns faded .
gangs , drug traffickers , and other criminal groups have expanded their activities , contributing to escalating levels of crime and violence that have alarmed citizens and overwhelmed governments .
the security situation in central america has deteriorated over the past decade .
