the reauthorization of map - 21 predominantly concerns highway funding .
because the condition and performance of freight infrastructure play a considerable role in the efficiency of the freight system , federal support of freight infrastructure investment is likely to be of significant congressional concern in the reauthorization of the surface transportation program .
113-159 ) .
the program is currently authorized by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ; p.l .
there is significant disagreement about the best way to accomplish improvements in freight system infrastructure .
the growth in freight transportation demand , along with growing passenger - side demand , has caused congestion in many parts of the transportation system , making freight movements slower and less reliable .
economic growth and expanded global trade have led to substantial increases in goods movement over the past few decades .
to some extent , these disagreements emerge from the diversity and complexity of the freight system itself , including its modal organization ( truck , rail , water , air , and pipeline ) , the different levels of public and private ownership and involvement by mode , and competition among different regions of the country .
among the most important areas of disagreement are how to raise new funds for investment , the magnitude of the amounts required , how to set priorities , and the role of the federal government in the planning process .
moreover , this report does not discuss environmental issues associated with freight movements such as carbon emissions and climate change , air pollution emissions , and noise .
this report does not deal with operational issues that also may be of interest during reauthorization , such as hours of service and hazardous material transport safety .
consequently , the focus of this report is on truck freight and that portion of the rail industry that transports truck trailers and containers ( intermodal freight ) .
to improve the condition and performance of the highway systems by implementing all cost - beneficial investments would require spending , fhwa estimates , between $123.7 and $145.9 billion annually ( 2010 dollars ) .
in 2010 , the most recent year for which comprehensive data are available , capital spending on highways by all levels of government was about $100 billion , of which about $44 billion ( 44% ) was provided by the federal government .
fhwa estimates that to maintain the existing condition and performance of the highway system from 2011 through 2030 would require annual expenditure of between $65.3 and $86.3 billion ( 2010 dollars ) , depending on the rate of growth in vehicle miles traveled ( vmt ) .
an intermediate improvement scenario , assuming the implementation of investments with a cost - benefit ratio of at least 1.5 , would require spending between $93.9 and $111.9 billion annually ( in 2010 dollars ) .
this is between 14% and 35% less than was spent in 2010 , although these differences drop to 2% and 26% if arra spending is excluded .
