specifically , we ( 1 ) identified federal funding for unclassified programs and activities to combat terrorism ; ( 2 ) determined whether any agency or entity has been designated to coordinate budget proposals , establish priorities , manage funding requirements , and help ensure the efficient allocation of federal resources for combating terrorism across federal agencies ; ( 3 ) explored opportunities for agencies to expand coordination of terrorism - related programs and activities under the government performance and results act principles and framework ; and ( 4 ) assessed issues concerning the reimbursement of support provided to agencies with lead counterterrorism responsibilities .
as noted in that report , we are reporting separately on your request that we identify interagency processes intended to ensure the efficient allocation of funding and resources for such efforts across the federal government .
we recently reported to you on the u.s. efforts to combat terrorism .
among its general mission responsibilities , the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to evaluate the effectiveness of agency programs , policies , and procedures ; assess competing funding demands among agencies ; set funding priorities ; and develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms .
under presidential decision directive ( pdd ) 39 ( u.s. policy on counterterrorism , june 1995 ) , the national security council ( nsc ) is to coordinate interagency terrorism policy issues and review ongoing crisis operations and activities concerning foreign terrorism and domestic terrorism with significant foreign involvement .
terrorism - related funding requests include nearly $290 million provided under the 1995 emergency supplemental appropriations act ( p.l .
these estimates totaled nearly $7 billion for unclassified programs and activities for fiscal year 1997 , and should be considered a minimum estimate of federal spending for unclassified terrorism - related programs and activities .
we recommend that consistent with the responsibility for coordinating efforts to combat terrorism , the assistant to the president for national security affairs , nsc , in consultation with the director , omb , and the heads of other executive branch agencies , take steps to ensure that ( 1 ) governmentwide priorities to implement the national counterterrorism policy and strategy are established ; ( 2 ) agencies' programs , projects , activities , and requirements for combating terrorism are analyzed in relation to established governmentwide priorities ; and ( 3 ) resources are allocated based on the established priorities and assessments of the threat and risk of terrorist attack .
to ensure that federal expenditures for terrorism - related activities are well - coordinated and focused on efficiently meeting the goals of u.s. policy under pdd 39 , we recommend that the director , omb , use data on funds budgeted and spent by executive departments and agencies to evaluate and coordinate projects and recommend resource allocation annually on a crosscutting basis to ensure that governmentwide priorities for combating terrorism are met and programs are based on analytically sound threat and risk assessments and avoid unnecessary duplication .
recent legislation requires that omb establish a reporting system for executive agencies on the budgeting and expenditure of funds for counterterrorism and antiterrorism programs and activities and that the president report this information annually to the congress , along with program priorities and any duplication of effort .
