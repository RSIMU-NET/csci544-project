agencies and members of the congress have long recognized that upfront funding for energy - efficiency improvements has often been difficult to obtain because of budget constraints and competing agency mission priorities .
whether to pay for energy - efficiency improvements that reduce energy consumption through up - front appropriations or through private financing is a matter of concern to many .
additional provisions in the act and various executive orders have added other goals , such as conserving water and using renewable fuels .
the energy policy act of 1992 and several subsequent executive orders require federal agencies to reduce their consumption of energy in federal facilities .
although energy - efficiency improvements were likely to save money over the life of the investments and replace aging infrastructure , budgetary constraints prevented agencies many times from receiving appropriations for such investments .
federal agency use of espcs was authorized by the congress to provide an alternative to direct appropriations for funding energy - efficiency improvements in federal facilities .
in 1986 , the congress provided agencies with an alternative mechanism for obtaining energy - efficiency improvements when it authorized agencies to use energy savings performance contracts ( espcs ) , a type of share - in - savings contract , to privately finance the improvements .
agencies' energy reduction goals became more ambitious as a result of executive order 13123 , and the new goals required agencies to allocate additional funds to install energy - efficiency improvements .
the federal government is the single largest energy consumer in the nation , spending about $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2002on energy for its approximately 500,000 facilities in the united states .
most notably , executive order 13123 , issued in 1999 , requires agencies , by 2010 , to reduce energy consumption by 35 percent from a 1985 baseline .
in this context , you asked us to determine , for contracts agencies undertook in fiscal years 1999 through 2003 , ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies used espcs ; ( 2 ) what energy savings , financial savings , and other benefits agencies expect to achieve ; ( 3 ) the extent to which actual financial savings from espcs cover costs ; and ( 4 ) what areas , if any , require steps to protect the government's financial interests in using espcs .
the congress authorized agencies to retain some or all of any annual savings available after required contractual payments to the energy services companies have been made .
many agencies were hard - pressed to pay for planned maintenance and repairs in their facilities , let alone make more significant building improvements .
this step reflected the trend in the federal government toward increased reliance on performance - based contracting to improve the services agencies receive from contractors .
the use of espcs in recent years has raised questions about how these contracts should be reflected in the federal budget .
agency officials commenting on this work agreed that timely upfront appropriations would be less costly than privately financing energy - efficiency improvements , if such appropriations were available , but stated that any delays in funding would result in a subsequent loss of energy and cost savings and these losses over time could offset the lower financing costs of the upfront funding .
