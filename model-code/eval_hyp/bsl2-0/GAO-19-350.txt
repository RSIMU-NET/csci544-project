 ( recommendation 2 ) .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the under secretary for health should implement , as appropriate , recommendations resulting from the assessment of the two previous sail evaluations .
this assessment should include the documentation of decisions about which recommendations to implement and assignment of officials or offices as responsible for implementing them .
the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) veterans health administration ( vha ) anticipates that it will provide care to more than 7 million veterans in fiscal year 2019 .
we and others have expressed concerns about vha's management of its health care system , including vha's ability to effectively provide and monitor access to quality and timely health care to veterans .
we are making the following two recommendations to va: the under secretary for health should assess recommendations from two previous evaluations of sail .
if changes to sail are implemented without this assessment of existing evaluations , vha may make changes that run counter to the evidence , potentially diminishing the integrity of the system to effectively evaluate performance .
these concerns contributed to our decision to add va health care to our high - risk list in 2015 , and to its continued inclusion in our 2017 and 2019 updates .
specifically , vha has not taken action to ensure that officials assess the recommendations from sail evaluations , document their decisions , and implement recommendations as appropriate .
the majority of veterans utilizing vha health care services receive care in one or more of va's 172 medical centers or their associated outpatient facilities .
vha designed sail to provide internal benchmarking of medical center performance and to promote high quality health care delivery across its system of regional networks and medical centers .
many measures are publicly reported and summarized on va web pages , allowing veterans the ability to review and compare medical centers' quality of care .
sail includes 29 performance measures ( 27 quality measures and two measures of overall efficiency and capacity ) in areas such as acute - care mortality , access to care , and employee satisfaction .
 ) ; new york harbor health care system ( new york , n.y. ) ; tennessee valley healthcare system ( nashville and murfreesboro , tenn. ) ; and va central california health care system ( fresno , calif. ) .
vha's strategic analytics for improvement and learning ( sail ) system consolidates , summarizes , and provides tools for interpreting medical center performance information .
vha collects an extensive amount of data that can be used to assess and manage the performance of its medical centers , including data on patient outcomes , access to care , and the patient experience .
however , vha has yet to use the results of those evaluations to address identified concerns and make evidence - based improvements to the sail system .
va partially concurred with our recommendation and has made limited progress in implementing it .
sail has been evaluated twice , and both evaluations have found similar concerns with sail .
we recommended that vha accelerate its efforts to develop a modern , credible , and effective performance management system , including the timely release of the performance plan template .
