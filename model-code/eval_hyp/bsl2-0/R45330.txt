such trends have been of interest to congress because they provide information about how the labor force is evolving , the resilience or sensitivity of some jobs to recession , and the changing needs of employers , and thereby inform workforce planning , income support programs , and other potential policy responses .
since 2007 , the labor market has been affected by factors such as the great recession of 2007-2009 , technological innovation , and an aging labor force that have altered the mix of jobs available to u.s. workers .
using data from the bureau of labor statistics , this report considers how such changes have affected the u.s. labor market since 2007 , examining the performance of labor market indicators like employment , unemployment , and labor force participation ; changes in the types of jobs available by industry and occupation ; and employment outcomes for different demographic groups .
recessions , for example , bring about increased joblessness with stronger impacts for certain worker groups , and changes in production patterns and consumers' preferences for goods and services — examples of structural forces — further influence the size and composition of employment .
labor markets are highly responsive to short - and long - term economic influences .
for example , total employment , the types of jobs available , their locations , and the skills sought by employers respond in various degrees to changing cyclical and structural forces .
this section discusses the contribution of business cycles ( notably the great recession ) and ongoing structural change to recent labor market developments .
this is because forces ( e.g. , recession , technological change ) act concurrently , and sometimes they can have interactive effects .
in the meantime , structural changes have also had disparate impacts on various industries and occupations .
the great recession led to greater employment loss in certain industries and occupations than others , but those effects have receded as the economy returns to full employment .
looking forward , the labor market will continue to evolve in response to cyclical and structural developments , creating future opportunities and challenges for u.s. workers .
this section discusses how industry and occupational employment has changed since 2007 .
in the past , construction and manufacturing employment has been more sensitive to the business cycle , and labor market recovery has been slower for certain minorities .
technology and globalization are not the only developments influencing future employment .
it remains to be seen whether current innovations , such as artificial intelligence ( ai ) and automation , will have an equally profound impact on labor markets .
the timing and intensity of labor market changes can in some cases point to the effects of a particular force , but it is beyond the scope of this report to identify specific , discrete contributions of each .
unemployment is below the congressional budget office's ( cbo's ) natural rate estimate of 4.7% ( i.e. , the lowest sustainable unemployment rate that the economy can currently achieve ) , a benchmark level accepted by many economists .
policy changes , such as immigration changes or a potential "trade war," can also lead to structural shifts in employment composition .
