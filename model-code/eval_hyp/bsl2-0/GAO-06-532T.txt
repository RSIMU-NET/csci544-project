my testimony today will focus on our prior work and discuss ( 1 ) factors that have affected gipsa's ability to investigate concerns about anticompetitive practices , ( 2 ) gipsa's actions to address our recommendations and areas where their efforts have fallen short , and ( 3 ) challenges and other issues we believe gipsa should consider as it moves to further strengthen its capacity to address competitiveness issues .
a more recent oig report shows that , in several key areas , gipsa still has not taken sufficient steps to address those recommendations .
within usda , the grain inspection , packers and stockyards administration ( gipsa ) is responsible for administering the packers and stockyards act and investigating concerns about unfair and anticompetitive practices in the $90 billion livestock market .
usda concurred with our findings and noted specific actions it planned to take in response to our recommendations , including ( 1 ) formalizing consultations between gipsa and ogc on complex investigations , and integrating ogc attorneys into its investigative teams ; ( 2 ) developing a tiered process whereby routine investigations would be reviewed and approved by headquarters staff , while complex investigations received an additional ogc review ; ( 3 ) adopting relevant procedures used by doj and ftc for planning , developing , implementing , and reviewing investigations ; and ( 4 ) reporting publicly on changing business practices and activities that raise fairness and competition concerns .
as you know , prior reports issued by the usda office of inspector general ( oig ) and our office have identified weaknesses in gipsa's investigation and enforcement activities , and recommended actions to address them .
second , gipsa's investigative practices were designed for traditional trade practices and financial issues the agency had emphasized for years and were not suited for the more complex competition - related concerns it was addressing .
in summary , in 2000 , we identified two critical factors that detracted from gipsa's ability to investigate anticompetitive practices in livestock markets , and another area where improvement was needed .
given gipsa's lack of progress in addressing prior report findings and recommendations dating back for almost a decade , continued vigilance and monitoring of its key activities and management initiatives by the oig and other oversight bodies is essential .
first , the agency's investigations were planned and conducted primarily by economists without the formal involvement of attorneys from usda's office of general counsel ( ogc ) .
in addition , gipsa had not followed through in adopting appropriate investigative guidance similar to those of doj and ftc to strengthen its ability to investigate anticompetitive and unfair practices .
finally , while not a critical concern , we noted that gipsa had an important role in keeping the industry and the congress informed about its monitoring of livestock markets and could have done more to identify market operations or activities that appeared to raise concerns under the packers and stockyards act .
we also recommended that gipsa adopt more systematic approaches for selecting cases and conducting investigations .
while potentially informative to the industry and policymakers , it could also help gipsa identify current and emerging areas of vulnerability and better target its oversight resources .
