as you requested , this report ( 1 ) describes the changes iaea is undertaking to strengthen its safeguards program , ( 2 ) assesses the reasonableness of iaea's assumptions regarding the impact of these changes on program costs and efficiency , and ( 3 ) comments on the extent of iaea's reliance on the united states to finance the agency's safeguards activities .
international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) safeguards are a cornerstone of u.s. and international efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation .
the discovery that iraq had developed a clandestine nuclear weapons program while iaea was inspecting iraq's civilian nuclear facilities caused the agency and its member states to initiate an intensive effort to strengthen further the safeguards system .
since the early 1970s , the international community has relied on iaea safeguards to independently verify that non - nuclear weapon states are complying with their obligations under the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons ( npt ) not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .
under the npt , states with comprehensive safeguards agreements must declare all nuclear material to the agency .
iaea then regularly inspects all facilities or locations containing declared material to verify its peaceful uses .
although iaea recognizes that some new costs will be incurred in implementing the strengthened safeguards system , it expects to offset increased annual implementation costs with future savings from greater efficiencies in safeguards operations , thereby maintaining current funding levels in the safeguards program .
iaea expects that changes to strengthen its safeguards program will enhance its capability to detect clandestine or undeclared nuclear activities in non - nuclear weapon states .
iaea has limited options for funding the new , strengthened safeguards system as long as its regular budget is held to zero real growth and competing funding priorities and political constraints inhibit reallocation of resources .
following revelations about iraq in 1991 , iaea adopted several measures to strengthen certain reporting requirements and to improve the agency's access to information .
while iaea has conducted some preliminary planning for implementing certain aspects of the new system , iaea does not know whether in the long run it can implement the new system with existing resources because it has not developed a long - term plan that ( 1 ) identifies the total resource requirements for implementing the new measures , ( 2 ) provides an implementation schedule with milestones for equipment and estimated projections for adoption of the additional protocol , or ( 3 ) establishes criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the new measures and whether they could be used to reduce inspection efforts .
u.s. and iaea officials agree that iaea will continue to seek increased u.s. financial support as the agency implements its new safeguards measures .
however , iaea does not know whether anticipated cost savings through efficiencies can be achieved .
iaea safeguards play a vital role in seeking to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation by verifying the peaceful use of nuclear materials .
moreover , iaea does not know whether , or to what extent , the new safeguards measures will allow a reduction in current inspection levels , and the savings in cost and inspector effort of some measures such as remote monitoring and environmental sampling at declared sites , may not be fully realized .
