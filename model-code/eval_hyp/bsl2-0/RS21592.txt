uranium enrichment can be used for both peaceful ( nuclear fuel ) and military ( nuclear weapons ) uses .
iran's current plans — to construct seven nuclear power plants ( 1000 mw each ) by 2025 — are still ambitious , particularly for a state with considerable oil and gas reserves .
iran argues , as it did in the 1970s , that rising domestic energy consumption should be met by nuclear power , leaving oil and gas sales to generate foreign currency .
few observers believe that such an ambitious program is necessary or economic for iran and many question iran's motives in developing uranium enrichment before even a single power reactor is in operation .
however , two decades of clandestine activities have raised questions about iran's intentions , and many have called for iran to rebuild world confidence by refraining from enrichment and reprocessing , perhaps indefinitely .
iran has asserted repeatedly that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful , stating in may 2003 that "we consider the acquiring , development and use of nuclear weapons inhuman , immoral , illegal and against our basic principles .
nonetheless , the further iran proceeds down the path of enrichment , the more difficult it will become to foreswear it , if only for financial reasons .
there were a few suspicions of a nuclear weapons program , but these abated in the decade between the iranian 1979 revolution and the end of the iran - iraq war , both of which brought a halt to nuclear activities .
they have no place in iran's defense doctrine. .
at the same time , supreme leader ali khamanei said in november 2004 that iran would not "give up" its enrichment "at any price" and former president khatami stated in march 2005 that ending iran's uranium enrichment program is "completely unacceptable. .
iranian government spokesman gholam hussein elham said in july 2006 that the islamic republic will never produce weapons of mass destruction .
the shah's plan to build 23 nuclear power reactors by the 1990s was regarded as grandiose , but not necessarily viewed as a "back door" to a nuclear weapons program , possibly because iran did not then seek the technologies to enrich or reprocess its own fuel .
iran has had a nuclear program for close to 50 years , beginning with a research reactor purchased from the united states in 1959 .
since june 2006 , the security council has demanded iranian compliance and transparency , and iran has failed to respond .
the p - 5 discussed sanctions through the fall , and the security council ultimately adopted unscr 1737 on december 23 , 2006 , which requires states to prevent the supply , sale or transfer of equipment and technology that could contribute to enrichment - , reprocessing - , heavy - water - related activities , or missile delivery systems in iran and to freeze the funds of persons and entities involved in the nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
broader measures could include an arms embargo , no support for wto membership , and a general freeze on assets of iranian financial institutions .
the proposal also outlined several measures targeted at iran's nuclear program should iran not agree to cooperate: a ban on nuclear - related exports , freeze of assets , travel / visa bans , suspension of technical cooperation with the iaea , a ban on investment in related entities , and on iranians studying abroad in nuclear and missile - related areas .
