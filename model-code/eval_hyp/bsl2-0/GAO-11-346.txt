the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has the authority to regulate some pharmaceuticals under several statutes , including its responsibility for regulating the nation's drinking water under the safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) .
pharmaceuticals are regulated by other agencies , including the food and drug administration ( fda ) and in some cases the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , but not as contaminants in drinking water .
these programs are known as take - back programs and in the united states they are also tied to efforts to reduce drug abuse or accidental poisoning by removing expired medicines from homes .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) provide information on the extent to which pharmaceuticals occur in drinking water and the effects , if any , that their occurrence has on human health ; ( 2 ) describe the approaches taken in the united states and in other countries to reduce the extent to which pharmaceuticals occur in drinking water ; and ( 3 ) identify challenges , if any , that epa faces in determining whether any pharmaceuticals should be regulated under sdwa , actions epa is taking to address these challenges , and options for addressing such challenges in the future .
to identify the extent to which pharmaceuticals occur in drinking water and their potential effects on human health , we reviewed federal and peer - reviewed reports , including ( 1 ) studies by the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , ( 2 ) articles in scientific journals , and ( 3 ) the pie workgroup's draft report .
federal , state , and local governments , and other countries have taken actions to reduce the extent to which pharmaceuticals enter the environment through programs that encourage the proper disposal of unused and expired pharmaceuticals .
the reports raised concerns about the potential impact of these pharmaceuticals on human health and the environment .
much is known about the therapeutic uses of pharmaceuticals , but little is known about their potential risk to human health from long - term exposure through drinking water .
to help understand the human health and ecological effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment , a workgroup of federal scientists was established in 2006 to identify and prioritize research to better understand the risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment and to recommend areas for federal collaboration to address those priorities .
to identify challenges , if any , that epa faces in determining whether any pharmaceuticals should be regulated under sdwa , actions epa is taking to address these challenges , and options for addressing such challenges in the future , we reviewed documentation related to epa's implementation of sdwa and interviewed epa and other federal officials knowledgeable about challenges epa is facing in implementing sdwa .
the concentrations detected were measured most frequently in parts per trillion .
we also interviewed scientists and other officials from federal agencies , as well as representatives from the pharmaceutical industry .
according to scientists , pharmaceuticals may enter the environment and ultimately drinking water supplies in various ways , such as through the elimination of human and animal waste , disposal of unused medicines down the toilet or drain , veterinary drug usage , hospital waste disposal , and industrial discharges .
