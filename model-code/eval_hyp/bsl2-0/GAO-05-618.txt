assessments for students with disabilities are also required under the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) .
given your interest in these issues , we are providing you with information about ( 1 ) the extent to which students with disabilities were included in statewide assessments ; ( 2 ) what issues selected states faced in implementing alternate assessments ; and ( 3 ) how the u.s. department of education ( education ) supported states in their efforts to assess students with disabilities .
questions have been raised , however , about the extent to which students with disabilities have been included in statewide assessments and whether these assessments accurately reflected student performance .
states must provide options to ensure that students with disabilities are included in annual assessments .
separately , under nclba , states participate periodically in the national assessment of educational progress ( naep ) , which provides a national picture of student academic achievement and a common measure of student achievement across states .
in an effort to improve the academic achievement of all students , including those with disabilities , the no child left behind act ( nclba ) of 2001 requires that states , districts , and schools are held accountable for their students' academic performance .
like all students , those with disabilities must be included in statewide assessments of achievement under the nclba .
states also are required to offer alternate assessments that measure students' performance at the same grade - level standards or at below grade - level standards .
for example , students with the most significant cognitive disabilities could be assessed on their knowledge of academic content , such as fractions , by having to split groups of objects into two , three , or equal parts .
states need to offer accommodations to meet these students' needs , for example , by giving them more time to take the same assessment as other students .
in the 2003-04 school year , more than 6 million students with disabilities — approximately 13 percent of all students — attended u.s. public schools .
to provide a national perspective , we reviewed and verified data on statewide assessments for the most recent school year available , 2003-04 , from the state consolidated performance reports provided by state officials to education .
in may 2005 , education announced additional efforts to help states use alternate assessments .
complete data were not available for mathematics assessments .
this included data from 48 states and the district of columbia on the participation rate of students with disabilities in assessments and data from 50 states and the district of columbia on the types of assessments in which students with disabilities were included .
to obtain this information we used multiple data collection methods .
two federal laws specifically require states to administer assessments for students with disabilities: nclba and the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) last amended in 2004 .
two states did not provide participation rate data in a usable format for students with disabilities , and one of these states also did not do so for all students .
there are programmatic implications for not demonstrating progress goals .
thus , we only verified reading - assessment data .
