reasons for this include unfunded expenses consuming budget increases .
to carry out its mission , irs has a budget of about $10 billion and staff of about 100,000 full time equivalents ( fte ) .
these additional resources were to be funded from budget increases , internally generated savings , or both .
savings projections have been revised downward since the 2004 budget request was prepared , which raises questions about irs's ability to achieve all the savings and shift resources to compliance as planned .
further , irs's recent history shows that it has been unable to increase resources in compliance , despite having made it a priority in budget requests .
the 2004 budget request is one of many that have identified compliance activities as among irs's top priorities for receiving additional resources .
for 2003 , irs expects to process 130 million individual income tax returns , issue 99 million refunds , receive 100 million telephone calls , and assist 4 million taxpayers face - to - face at irs and volunteer offices .
with respect to the budget , we assessed the likelihood that irs will be able to allocate more resources to one of its key priorities , compliance , and whether the proposed spending on some computer systems is justified .
in fact , for the most recent three full fiscal years — 2000 , 2001 and 2002 — compliance resources have declined slightly .
this includes ( 1 ) $429 million for the agency's multiyear capital account that funds contractor costs for the bsm program and ( 2 ) about $1.67 billion and 7,735 staff years for information systems , of which $1.62 billion is for operations and maintenance .
another priority area for irs is information technology ( it ) .
reasons for this decline include unfunded expenses consuming budget increases and workload increases in other essential operations .
irs is requesting about $2.1 billion and 7,986 staff years in information technology resources for fiscal year 2004 .
in summary , our assessment of irs's 2004 budget request shows that: irs is requesting 100,043 ftes and $10.4 billion , an increase of about 5 percent over its fiscal year 2003 request .
with its mission to “provide america's taxpayers with top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all,” irs is responsible for collecting most of the funds that pay for the federal government .
we are pleased to participate in the subcommittee's inquiry into internal revenue service's ( irs ) fiscal year 2004 budget request and 2003 tax filing season performance .
as you requested , our statement discusses both irs's 2004 budget request and its 2003 filing season performance .
however , until irs fully implements planned process improvements , its ability to develop supportable information systems budget requests will remain limited .
our assessment of the budget request is based on a comparative analysis of irs's fiscal year 2003 and 2004 budget requests , supporting documentation , and interviews with irs officials .
with respect to the filing season , we assessed irs's performance in processing returns and providing assistance to taxpayers .
