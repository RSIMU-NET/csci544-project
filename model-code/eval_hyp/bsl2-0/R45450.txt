t his report provides an overview of statutory inspectors general ( igs ) in the federal government , including their structure , functions , and related issues for congress .
consequently , igs may face increasing demand to complete statutorily mandated reviews of programs and operations that require ( 1 ) a broader focus on program performance and effectiveness in addition to waste , fraud , and abuse ; ( 2 ) analysis of specialty or technical programs , possibly in emerging policy areas ; and ( 3 ) use of more complex analytical methods and tools .
statutory igs exist in more than 70 federal entities , including departments , agencies , boards , commissions , and government - sponsored enterprises .
agency programs and operations have increased in breadth , complexity , and interconnectedness .
ig reviews can be grouped into three broad categories: ( 1 ) performance audits , ( 2 ) inspections or evaluations , and ( 3 ) investigations .
igs conduct reviews of government programs and operations .
to execute their missions , igs lead offices of inspector general ( oigs ) that conduct audits , investigations , and other evaluations of agency programs and operations and produce recommendations to improve them .
statutory inspectors general ( igs ) are intended to be independent , nonpartisan officials who prevent and detect waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement within federal departments and agencies .
as the federal government continues to evolve , so too does the role of igs in government oversight .
congress , therefore , may have an interest in ensuring that statutory igs possess the resources and authorities necessary to fulfill their oversight roles .
congress may consider several options regarding ig structures , functions , and coordination as the role of igs in government oversight evolves .
further , igs' dual reporting structure — to both agency heads and congress — positions them to advise agencies on how to improve their programs and policies and to advise congress on how to monitor and facilitate such improvement .
an ig generally conducts a review in response to a statutory mandate , at the request of congress or other stakeholders ( e.g. , the president ) , or upon self - initiation .
the structure and placement of igs in government agencies allows oig personnel to develop the expertise necessary to conduct in - depth assessments of agency programs .
statutory igs play a key role in government oversight , and congress plays a key role in establishing the structures and authorities to enable that oversight .
reviews can occur once or periodically .
observers have further argued that greater emphasis on program outcomes could better improve agency programs and operations and , by extension , increase ig effectiveness .
in serving congress with nonpartisan and objective analysis and research , crs does not make recommendations or take positions on particular options .
the genesis and frequency of such reviews can vary .
while igs are authorized to develop recommendations to improve government programs and operations , they are not authorized to enforce them .
congress and other observers have expressed concern about the total number of unimplemented ig recommendations and potential barriers to resolving them , such as the quality and consistency of agency and ig audit follow - up procedures , tracking unimplemented recommendations , and determining the resolution of recommendations .
