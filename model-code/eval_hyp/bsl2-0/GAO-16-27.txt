this report addresses the extent to which the test program ( 1 ) reduces administrative costs , and ( 2 ) enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses .
despite the 25- year tenure of the test program , little is publicly known about its results , as the department of defense ( dod ) has not published any reports on its performance .
although the test program's initial performance period was 3 years , congress has extended its duration eight times , with the most recent extension scheduled to end december 31 , 2017 .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included a provision for us to report on the results of the test program .
the purpose of the test program is to reduce the administrative burden on contractors and enhance subcontracting opportunities for small businesses .
to address whether the test program enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses , we reviewed legislation and agency guidance for the test program and relevant gao and dod reports .
to address whether the test program reduces administrative costs , we analyzed dod - commissioned reviews of the program performed in 2002 , 2007 , and 2013 ; each of which included estimates of the cost savings or avoidance associated with the program .
in 1989 , congress authorized the test program for negotiation of comprehensive small business subcontracting plans ( test program ) , which permits participating contractors to submit a single subcontracting plan covering all of their contracts rather than a separate plan for each contract .
we also reviewed test program participants' comprehensive subcontracting plans from fiscal years 2006 — the first year not covered by a prior dod review — through 2013 — the last year for which full data were available .
we assessed the methodologies employed and assumptions used , including estimates of the number of contracts and cost of labor involved in preparing program documentation , to arrive at the estimates for savings .
contractors on certain defense contracts are required to develop plans specifying how much of the work will be performed by subcontractors .
we interviewed officials from dod and 5 of the 12 test program participants , selected to represent different levels of corporate participation in the program and varying volumes of small business subcontracting activity , to obtain their views on any reduction in administrative costs and other benefits they may have realized from their participation in the program .
we compared the approved subcontracting goals and initiatives as stated in the plans to the results for each participant and as reflected in annual performance reviews , known as form 640 reviews , conducted by the defense contract management agency ( dcma ) to establish trends for participant performance .
the views expressed by these participants provided insight into the operation of the program , but are not generalizable to all program participants .
however , dod has not taken action to address the program's status .
prior dod reviews estimated that use of the test program resulted in the avoidance of millions of dollars in administrative costs for both participants and dod and may offer other benefits .
test program participants and dod officials we interviewed stated that the use of comprehensive subcontracting plans results in benefits other than administrative cost avoidance as well .
