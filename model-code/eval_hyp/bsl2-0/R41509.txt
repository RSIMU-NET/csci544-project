the bureau of land management ( blm ) , in the department of the interior ( doi ) , is authorized to exchange land or interests in land under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 ( flpma ) , as amended by the federal land exchange facilitation act of 1988 ( flefa ) , as well as under other authorities .

critics assert that administrative exchanges are inherently difficult and that this difficulty has contributed to a decrease in exchanges over the past quarter century .
