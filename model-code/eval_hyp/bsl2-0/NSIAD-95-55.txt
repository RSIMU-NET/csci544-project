as requested , we collected and analyzed information on ( 1 ) the status of the army's planning process for the nonstockpile disposal program , ( 2 ) the army's estimated disposal cost and schedule , and ( 3 ) lessons learned from the army's ongoing stockpile disposal program that may also apply to the proposed nonstockpile program .
these items are referred to as nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel and consist of binary chemical weapons , miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel , recovered chemical weapons , former chemical weapon production facilities , and buried chemical warfare materiel .
this report responds to your request that we review the department of the army's disposal program for chemical munitions , materiel , and facilities that are not specifically included in the u.s. stockpile of unitary chemical weapons .
our scope and methodology are described in appendix i .
the opposition centers around concerns about adverse health effects and environmental hazards .
in the fiscal year 1993 national defense authorization act ( p.l .
the united states agreed to dispose of ( 1 ) binary chemical weapons , recovered chemical weapons , and former chemical weapon production facilities within 10 years and ( 2 ) miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel within 5 years of the date the convention becomes effective .
the army also reported that it would cost $16.6 billion ( $12.04 billion in direct disposal costs and $4.56 billion in programmatic costs ) to recover and destroy , primarily by incineration and neutralization , buried chemical materiel within 40 years .
for example , there is strong public opposition to incineration and transportation of chemical weapons across state boundaries .
in addition , the opinions and concerns of the affected states , local governments , and the public will affect the army's decisions .
factors the army intends to consider are population proximity and density , chemical weapon type , condition of the munitions , and public safety and environmental policy .
programmatic costs are associated with more than one disposal project or program category .
however , because of uncertainties about the nature and magnitude of the materiel or the disposal methods to be used , the army recognizes that its $17.7-billion cost estimate for the nonstockpile disposal program cannot be relied on for budget purposes .
the act delegates regulatory and enforcement responsibilities to the states but limits some state regulations .
for example , the portion of management and personnel costs that support more than one project is considered programmatic costs .
in november 1985 , the congress directed the army to destroy the department of defense's ( dod ) stockpile of unitary chemical weapons .
appendix iv lists the disposal methods used by the army to develop its program cost and schedule estimates .
the act also allows states to establish requirements more stringent than federal standards .
dod officials estimate that the convention will enter into force in fiscal year 1996 .
the report concluded that it would cost the army $1.1 billion ( $930 million in direct project disposal costs and $170 million in programmatic costs ) to destroy , primarily by incineration , demolition , and neutralization , the nonstockpile chemical materiel required by the convention within the required time frames .
