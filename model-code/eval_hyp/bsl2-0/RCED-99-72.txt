in fiscal year 1998 , hud insured mortgage loans for single - family housing totaling approximately $100 billion .
numerous allegations and complaints about the poor quality of appraisals conducted for the purposes of mortgage insurance issued by the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) have raised concerns about the fha appraisal process .
appraisals influence the loan amounts that fha insures , and incomplete or inaccurate appraisals resulting in overvaluations may expose fha to greater financial risks .
 ( 2 ) to what extent is hud holding appraisers accountable for poor - quality fha appraisals ? .
this report provides information on the following questions: ( 1 ) how well is hud monitoring the performance of the appraisers on its roster and implementing procedures for addressing consumers' complaints about fha appraisals ? .
 ( 3 ) to what extent is hud holding lenders responsible for the quality of the fha appraisals they use ? .
 ( 4 ) how does hud ensure that the appraisers on its roster are qualified to perform fha appraisals ? .
in light of these problems , you asked us to conduct a broad assessment of hud's oversight of the fha appraisal process .
however , we did not estimate the impact that hud's oversight of the appraisal process might have on the financial health of fha's mortgage insurance fund .
in may 1998 , we reported on the quality of fha appraisals for nine homes in new jersey and ohio that a group of appraisers selected to illustrate their concerns about the completeness of some fha appraisals .
we noted that the appraisal reports for eight of the nine properties did not reflect conditions we observed that could adversely affect the structural soundness and continued marketability of the houses and the health and safety of the occupants .
to address these issues , we focused on the activities of hud's headquarters and its philadelphia and denver homeownership centers ( hoc ) .
we also reported that hud's field offices did not adequately monitor the performance of the appraisers of these properties .
hud has not resolved internal disagreements about its authority and policy to hold lenders accountable for poor - quality appraisals .
the states' minimum licensing standards do not require proficiency in fha's guidelines , and hud is considering , but has not implemented , its own testing requirement .
in fiscal year 1998 , hud performed about 81,000 field reviews of appraisals nationwide .
hud's revision of its appraisal guidance and forms and its plans to test appraisers on their knowledge of fha appraisal requirements are likely to help appraisers perform their work in accordance with fha standards .
hud could significantly improve its monitoring of appraisers .
hud is not doing a good job of monitoring the performance of appraisers , thereby limiting the agency's ability to assess the quality of appraisals used for fha - insured loans .
hud's reliance on the states' licensing process and self - certification provide limited assurance that the appraisers on fha's roster are knowledgeable of fha's appraisal requirements .
hud established four hocs to administer the single - family housing functions formerly performed by its 81 field offices .
