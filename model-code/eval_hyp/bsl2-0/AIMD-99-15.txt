we further reported that these control weaknesses and inherent vulnerabilities expose irs and taxpayers to losses .
this report discusses additional internal control weaknesses over the safeguarding of receipts and taxpayer data that we identified in april 1998 and provides our recommendations for improvement .
to follow up on these weaknesses and to assess physical security conditions at irs during the peak filing season , we observed physical controls over receipts and taxpayer data at service centers and district offices in april 1998 as part of our ongoing audit of irs' fiscal year 1998 financial statements .
as reported in our audit of irs' fiscal year 1997 custodial financial statementsand in subsequent congressional hearings on irs financial management issues , irs' internal controls at service centers were not adequate to sufficiently ensure that cash and checks received from taxpayers were properly credited to taxpayers' accounts and deposited to the department of the treasury general fund .
this letter presents the results of our review of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) physical controls over receipts and taxpayer data .
in fiscal year 1997 , irs collected more than $1.6 trillion in tax revenue .
irs has also suffered losses due to various financial crime schemes .
we are also sending it to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the senate committee on appropriations and its subcommittee on treasury and general government ; senate committee on finance and its subcommittee on taxation and irs oversight ; senate committee on governmental affairs ; senate committee on the budget ; house committee on appropriations and its subcommittee on treasury , postal service , and general government ; house committee on ways and means ; house committee on government reform and oversight and its subcommittee on government management , information and technology ; house committee on the budget ; and other interested congressional committees .
according to a secret service official , identified losses to victimized individuals and institutions due to financial crimes involving identity fraud increased from $442 million in fiscal year 1995 to $745 million in fiscal year 1997 .
instances of financial crimes committed at irs and their possible consequences demonstrate the importance of establishing and maintaining adequate physical controls over receipts and taxpayer data .
most of this revenue was collected by intermediaries , such as financial depository institutions , and transferred directly to the treasury general fund .
however , the remainder — estimated at over $100 billion in fiscal year 1997 — was collected directly by irs through its many service centers and district offices .
however , a sound system of internal control should minimize the extent of this vulnerability to ensure that the government and taxpayers are not unduly exposed to loss of funds and misuse of taxpayer data , both of which could undermine the public's trust in irs' ability to safeguard taxpayer funds and personal information .
with the weaknesses and vulnerabilities identified , there are likely many thefts that have gone undetected .
the objectives of our review were to ( 1 ) follow - up on cash receipt weaknesses identified in our audit of irs' fiscal year 1997 custodial financial statements , and ( 2 ) observe operations during the peak filing season as part of our fiscal year 1998 financial statement audit .
