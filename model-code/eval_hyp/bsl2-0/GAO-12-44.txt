while multiple dhs components are responsible for information sharing , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is the department lead on providing transportation security - related information to other dhs components and public and private stakeholders .
the homeland security act of 2002 assigned the department of homeland security ( dhs ) responsibility for sharing information with its federal , state , local , and private sector homeland security partners to assist in the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks .

tsa has developed security - related information products as part of its efforts to share security - related information with transportation stakeholders .
in january 2005 , we designated establishing effective mechanisms for sharing terrorism - related information to protect the homeland a high - risk area because the government had continued to face challenges in analyzing and disseminating this information in a timely , accurate , and useful manner .
