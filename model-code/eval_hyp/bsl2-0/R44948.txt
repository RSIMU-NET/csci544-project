the social security administration ( ssa ) is responsible for administering two federal entitlement programs that provide income support to individuals with severe , long - term disabilities: social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
for a quick overview of ssdi and ssi , see crs in focus if10506 , social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) , and crs in focus if10482 , supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
in 2017 , ssdi and ssi combined paid an estimated $199 billion in federally administered benefits to 14.5 million qualified disabled individuals and 1.5 million non - disabled dependents of disabled workers .
in contrast , ssi is a need - based public assistance program that provides monthly cash payments to aged , blind , or disabled individuals ( including blind or disabled children ) who have limited assets and little or no social security or other income .
ssdi is a work - related social insurance program that provides monthly cash benefits to nonelderly disabled workers and their eligible dependents , provided the workers accrued a sufficient number of earnings credits during their careers in jobs subject to social security taxes .
it also explains how benefit amounts are computed , the types of non - cash benefits available to individuals who meet ssa's disability standards , and how each program is financed .
both programs use the same basic definition of disability to determine eligibility ; however , by virtue of design , each program serves a somewhat different population .
this report discusses the rules and processes used to determine eligibility for ssdi and ssi .
for ssdi beneficiaries with minimal benefits and other income , ssi increases their overall monthly disability benefit from ssa .
of those , more than 1.3 million ( or 10% ) received both types of disability benefits .
the average combined benefit for concurrent disability beneficiaries in december 2016 was $783 ( table 7 ) .
assuming they meet the applicable eligibility requirements , concurrent disability beneficiaries receive health coverage under medicare and medicaid .
individuals who qualify for both health care programs are known as dual eligibles .
the purpose of ssi for adults is generally twofold: ( 1 ) to provide cash assistance to aged , blind , or disabled individuals who have no income and ( 2 ) to supplement the incomes of those who have low social security benefits .
in december 2016 , about 12.8 million adults aged 18-64 received ssdi or ssi due to a qualifying impairment ( figure 3 ) .
thus , disabled workers ( who have higher average ssdi benefit amounts ) received lower average ssi payments , and disabled adult children ( who have lower average ssdi benefit amounts ) received higher ssi payments , resulting in roughly the same combined disability benefit amount across all three beneficiary types .
as shown in figure 4 , the average benefit amount for concurrent disability beneficiaries is higher than that for ssi - only recipients but is lower than that for ssdi - only beneficiaries .
because average benefits for concurrent disability beneficiaries were below the fbr for an individual ( $733 per month in 2016 ) and because ssdi benefits generally offset ssi payments on a dollar - for - dollar basis , combined benefit levels for each type of concurrent ssdi beneficiary were about the same .
