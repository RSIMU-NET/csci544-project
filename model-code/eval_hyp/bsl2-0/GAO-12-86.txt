shortly after the april 20 , 2010 explosion , members of congress requested that we ( 1 ) identify the financial risks to the federal government resulting from oil spills , particularly deepwater horizon , ( 2 ) assess npfc's internal controls for ensuring that processes and payments for cost reimbursements and processes for claims related to the deepwater horizon spill were appropriate , and ( 3 ) describe the extent to which the federal government oversees the bp and gccf deepwater horizon oil spill - related claims processes .
npfc administers the fund by disbursing funds to government agencies to reimburse them for their oil spill cleanup costs ( cost reimbursements ) , monitoring the sources and uses of funds , adjudicating claims submitted by individuals and businesses to the fund for payment ( claims ) , and pursuing reimbursement from the responsible party for costs and damages paid from the fund ( billing the responsible party ) .
we also made four recommendations to npfc directed at helping npfc establish and maintain effective cost reimbursement policies and procedures for the fund and update npfc's current policies to reflect current organization , structure , and management directives .
we expressed the view that congress should consider changing the calculation of expenditures made against the fund's $1 billion per incident expenditure cap to take into account reimbursements from responsible parties .
the total costs to clean up this unprecedented spill , ease the economic suffering of affected parties in the region , and assess and mitigate its eventual environmental impact remain unknown but have been estimated in the tens of billions of dollars .
bp also established an irrevocable trust in august 2010 — primarily to pay claims approved by gccf among other purposes — and pledged to incrementally provide a total of $20 billion to the trust by 2014 .
opa provides the oil spill liability trust fund ( fund ) to pay for oil spill costs when the responsible party cannot or does not pay .
the fund is administered by the coast guard through its national pollution funds center ( npfc ) , is primarily financed through a tax on petroleum products , and is subject to a $1 billion cap on the amount of expenditures from the fund per incident .
in november 2010 , we provided our preliminary assessment of the financial risks and the cost reimbursement and notification policies and procedures associated with the deepwater horizon oil spill .
in this capacity , bp established multiple claims centers along the gulf coast to receive and process individuals' and businesses' damage claims ; on may 3 , 2010 , bp began paying emergency compensation to them .
 ( see appendix i for the specific recommendations and their status. ) .
along with the devastating environmental impact , the deepwater horizon oil spill affected the livelihoods of thousands of gulf coast citizens and businesses .
in june 2010 , as part of an oral agreement between the obama administration and bp , bp established a new claims processing facility , the gulf coast claims facility ( gccf ) .
in the case of the deepwater horizon oil spill , bp , as well as others , have been identified as responsible parties .
