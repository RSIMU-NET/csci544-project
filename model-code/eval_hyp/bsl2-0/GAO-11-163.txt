at the same time , medical units deployed to afghanistan face logistical challenges created by geography and the lack of physical infrastructure such as roads and utilities that complicate their ability to provide advanced medical care to warfighters .
providing military medical care for ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan presents other challenges .
in our past reports , we have highlighted several issues concerning military medical personnel requirements .
for example , in september 2006 , we reported that some combat support and combat service support skills , including medical , were in particularly high demand to meet requirements for operations in iraq and afghanistan .
in response to the congressional committees' continued interest in the medical and dental personnel requirements of the military services , including their reserve components , needed to , among other things , meet their medical missions in support of contingency operations and deliver high - quality health care to eligible beneficiaries , we agreed to undertake additional work on issues related to dod's medical personnel .
for this report , we focused on military medical support for contingency operations in iraq and afghanistan , and as such , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) dod has assessed its need for military medical personnel to support ongoing operations , ( 2 ) the army has adapted the composition and use of its medical units to provide advanced medical care , and ( 3 ) the army fills medical personnel gaps that arise in theater .
sustained u.s. involvement in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere has placed stresses on the department of defense's ( dod ) medical personnel , particularly for certain high - demand specialists such as psychiatrists and physician assistants .
dod medical personnel have dual responsibilities to provide medical care at health care facilities in the united states and abroad to servicemembers , former servicemembers , and other beneficiaries , and , when called upon , to provide urgent , lifesaving medical care on the battlefield and medical support to u.s. armed forces .
for instance , as the number and mix of medical personnel specialists decreases in iraq , in line with the theaterwide reduction of forces , the military must continue to provide medical support while adapting to reduced numbers of medical personnel .
in july 2010 , we reported that the services' collaborative planning efforts regarding requirements determination for medical personnel working in fixed military treatment facilities have been limited .
we also noted that the services' requirements processes are not always validated and verifiable , as dod guidance requires .
in april 2009 , we noted that dod faced challenges in accessing and retaining medical officers , such as the limited supply and high demand for qualified medical professionals ; the lower pay generally offered to them by the military compared to the private sector ; the stress , length , and frequency of deployments ; and the length of required service commitments .
that report also found that medical and other support skills , which reside primarily in the army's reserve components , were in increasingly short supply due to restrictions on the length and frequency of reserve deployments .
for our first objective , we analyzed dod's policies and processes that govern the medical personnel requirements determination process and compared dod guidance and theater - level guidance regarding medical care for deployed dod civilians and noted how they differed .
