my statement today addresses ( 1 ) our most recent estimates of the net financial benefit from replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin , ( 2 ) the long - standing public and private sector considerations of such a replacement , and ( 3 ) the experiences of other countries with replacing currency .
several foreign countries have already transitioned from small note denominations to coins , for a number of reasons , including the greater durability of coins and inflationary pressures .
we have previously reported on public opposition to using the $1 coin and the challenges that private businesses such as vending machine owners would face if such a transition were undertaken .
however , we realize that replacing the $1 note with the $1 coin is controversial .
for our march 2011 report , to estimate the net financial benefit to the government , we constructed an economic model with data from the federal reserve , and the department of the treasury's ( treasury department ) bureau of engraving and printing and the united states mint ( mint ) .
gao has reported six times over the last 22 years that replacing the $1 note with the $1 coin would result in net financial benefits to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
this statement is based primarily on our most recent reports issued in march 2011 and february 2012 .
we continue to believe that replacing the note with a coin is likely to provide a financial benefit to the government if the note is eliminated and negative public reaction is effectively managed through stakeholder outreach and public education .
first , the costs are immediate and certain while the benefits are further in the future and more uncertain .
to determine the effects such a replacement would have on the public and on private business , we identified and interviewed officials from industries and organizations that could be affected by currency changes .
in our prior reports , we recommended that congress proceed with replacing the $1 note with the $1 coin .
for our february 2012 report , we updated our model to reflect actions taken by the federal reserve and the treasury department .
in fact , public opinion has consistently been opposed to the $1 coin .
although we recognize that such a replacement would have benefits and costs for the public and for private businesses , the model was designed to estimate the net benefit and costs solely to the federal government and did not quantify the effects on the public or on private business .
keeping those caveats in mind , many other countries have successfully replaced low denomination notes with coins , even when initially faced with public opposition .
in its most basic form , the model measures the difference between the status quo scenario – – where $1 coins are available , but $1 notes predominate – – and an alternative replacement scenario in which the $1 note is replaced with the $1 coin , the $1 notes are phased out , and $1 coins are produced and issued into circulation at a rate to match the way the public uses coins .
