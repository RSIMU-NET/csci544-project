however , the costs of federal timber sale programs have not decreased proportionately , and recent studies and testimony before congressional committees have suggested that some states operate their timber sale programs at less cost than the federal agencies .
as part of an ongoing effort to reduce federal spending , you asked us to compare the timber sale programs of the two federal agencies with those of the states .
in recent years , the volumes of timber sold and harvested from these federal timberlands have decreased because of the increased efforts to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species and to achieve a better balance of multiple resource uses .
specifically , this report identifies ( 1 ) the major differences among the timber programs of the forest service's pacific northwest region , the bureau of land management , and the states of washington and oregon and ( 2 ) the effect of these differences on the agencies' planning processes .
this acreage accounts for 37.7 percent of the available timberland in those states .
the bureau of land management ( blm ) , within the department of the interior , and the forest service , within the u.s. department of agriculture , manage 12.5 million acres of timberland in the states of washington and oregon .
in order to comply with other federal statutory requirements — such as the national environmental policy act or the endangered species act — the federal agencies spend considerably more time and resources on both long - and short - term planning .
washington's and oregon's legislation emphasizes timber production in order to maximize revenues over the long term to benefit the schools and counties within the states .
state lands generally have second - growth forests , whereas federal timberlands contain a mixture of second - growth and old - growth forests with portions set aside for wilderness and roadless areas .
federal and state timber programs differ in their legislative and regulatory guidance , in the types of timberlands managed , and in their sources of funding .
unlike in the states' timber programs , no clear linkage exists between the receipts of federal timber sales and the sources of funding for those sales , thus removing an important incentive to increase receipts and decrease costs .
still , their decisions are challenged more frequently than those made by the states .
to cover their timber program costs , federal agencies rely primarily on annual appropriations .
while the states have developed shorter planning processes that satisfy their legal requirements and get the job done quickly , the federal planning processes are more lengthy and expensive .
both the forest service and blm generally manage their lands under laws that emphasize multiple resource uses , such as timber , fish and wildlife , and recreation .
rather , they generally have second - growth forests with existing road systems , and relatively few areas have been withdrawn from timber use .
these differences provide some indicators of why the states can operate their timber sale programs at less cost than the federal agencies in the pacific northwest .
modifying these differences , however , would require changes in how the federal programs are currently structured — a complex and intricate task , involving stakeholders with varying views on how to best balance the goals of multiple resource uses .
