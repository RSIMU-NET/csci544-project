we have made 24 recommendations aimed at enhancing internal controls over dod's disposal and accountability of its excess property and improving the overall economy and efficiency of dla's reutilization program , including better coordination regarding data reliability and strengthening management oversight , accountability , and physical inventory control .
over the past 15 years , we have examined dod's excess property reutilization program and reported deficiencies , including unauthorized parties obtaining excess controlled property and internal control breakdowns with regard to security of sensitive excess military equipment .
section 1051 ( f ) of the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2016 included a provision for us to conduct an assessment of dod's excess property program , which is managed by the defense logistics agency ( dla ) .
the department has implemented 22 of the 24 recommendations .
since 1991 , dod has reported transferring more than $6 billion worth of its excess controlled and non - controlled personal property to more than 8,600 federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies .
likewise , the dod office of inspector general has reported on internal control deficiencies , such as the distribution of excess property to law enforcement agencies without the accountability necessary to ensure that the released property had the proper authorization .
this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) dla has taken actions to enhance processes , including internal controls , related to its transfers of excess controlled property ; and ( 2 ) dla has addressed the statutory requirement to maintain a public internet site that provides transparency about controlled property transfers and about the recipients of such property .
the inspector general has made a number of recommendations , which the department has implemented .
dla has revised its policy and procedures , is developing additional training , and is establishing mous for the leso program with participating federal law enforcement agencies .
examples of controlled items available through the leso program include night - vision goggles , thermal imaging equipment , specialized printers , and explosive ordnance detonation robots , as well as certain high - visibility items , such as small arms , high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles ( hmmwvs ) , mine‚Äêresistant ambush protected vehicles ( mraps ) , and aircraft .
dla has taken some actions and plans additional actions to address identified weaknesses in its excess controlled property program .
according to dod , approximately 4 to 7 percent of the total excess property items transferred to law enforcement agencies is controlled ; the remaining percentage of excess property is non - controlled .
the law enforcement support office ( leso ) program , also known as the 1033 program in reference to the section of the law authorizing it , allows for the transfer of personal property to federal and state agencies , including small arms and ammunition , determined to be in excess of the needs of the department of defense ( dod ) and suitable for use by the agencies in law enforcement activities .
pursuant to a series of laws passed since 1989 , dod is authorized to undertake actions intended to enhance the effectiveness of domestic law enforcement agencies through direct or material support .
