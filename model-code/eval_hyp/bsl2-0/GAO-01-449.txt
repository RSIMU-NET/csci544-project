the agency for international development allocated a 53-percent increase in funding , from $114 million to $174 million , for fiscal year 2001 to expand its hiv / aids efforts in sub - saharan africa .
specifically , we ( 1 ) identified the development and impact of the hiv / aids epidemic in sub - saharan africa and the challenges to slowing its spread , ( 2 ) assessed the extent to which the u.s. agency for international development's initiatives have contributed to the fight against aids in sub - saharan africa , and ( 3 ) identified the approach the agency used to allocate increased funding and the factors that may affect the agency's ability to expand its hiv / aids program in sub - saharan africa .
since the 1980s , the u.s. agency for international development has provided assistance to help fight aids in sub - saharan africa .
for example , the national intelligence council concluded that the persistence of infectious diseases , such as hiv / aids , is likely to aggravate and in some cases provoke economic decline , social fragmentation , and political destabilization .
in addition , the council found that the epidemic threatens to weaken the military capabilities of countries and because of the involvement of sub - saharan african troops in international peacekeeping efforts it could hinder those activities as well .
further , given the scale of the epidemic , aids has grown beyond a public health problem to become a humanitarian and developmental crisis .
