recent estimates show that the total investment cost of the fcs program will be at least $163 billion and perhaps over $200 billion when complementary programs are included .
to achieve its goals for the fcs program , in 2003 the army decided to employ a lead systems integrator ( lsi ) to assist in defining , developing , and integrating fcs .
the pros and cons of lsi arrangements have been the subject of much debate on the fcs and other programs , such as the coast guard's deepwater program .
in the past few years , dod and other agencies have applied the lsi concept in a variety of ways .
using this new approach , the army intends to manage trade - offs across individual warfighter communities and weapon systems , save cost , and accelerate delivery .
the institute for defense analyses , the army audit agency , and gao have highlighted potential risks with the lsi approach on the fcs program .
we also drew significantly on existing gao work on weapon system acquisitions .
after several decades of developing systems through disconnected warfighter communities within the army , fcs is proposed as an integrated , system - of - systems concept rather than having integration occur after systems are produced .
this included such items as the program contract and acquisition strategy .
in light of the scope of the fcs program and its associated cost estimates , as well as concerns over the role of the lsi , congress mandated that gao review and report on the use of an lsi on fcs .
as agreed with committee staff , this report addresses the questions from the mandate , specifically: ( 1 ) why the army decided to employ an lsi for the fcs program ; ( 2 ) the nature of the lsi's working relationship with the army ; and ( 3 ) how the contract fees , provisions , and incentives work .
in the case of the fcs program , the role of the lsi is not simply that of a traditional prime contractor , but also includes some elements of a partner to the government in ensuring the design , development and prototype implementation of the fcs network and family of systems .
the warfighting concept embodied by fcs involves breaking with army traditions and making unprecedented technological leaps .
with the future combat systems ( fcs ) program , the army is embracing a new warfighting concept by replacing most of its combat systems with a family of manned and unmanned vehicles and systems linked by an advanced information network .
in addition , we held discussions with key officials at dod and throughout the fcs program , including representatives from the army , the lsi and various subcontractors .
our letter dated march 15 , 2007 satisfied the reporting requirements for that mandate .
we conducted our work from may 2006 through june 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government accountability standards .
in conducting our work , we reviewed extensive program documentation pertaining to the business arrangement between the army and lsi .
further detail about our scope and methodology is provided in appendix i of this report .
instead , they require additional scrutiny before they are approved and increased oversight if they are approved .
