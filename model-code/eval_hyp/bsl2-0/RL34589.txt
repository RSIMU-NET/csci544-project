reducing pm 2.5 concentrations , as cair would do , was estimated by epa to have significant health benefits , eliminating 13,000-22,000 premature deaths annually .
cair , promulgated by epa under the clean air act ( caa ) in may 2005 , established a regional cap - and - trade program for sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) and nitrogen oxide ( nox ) emissions from electric generating units ( egus ) in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia .
cair's nox cap reduces emissions in the affected states by similar percentages: a first phase in 2009 lowered the emissions cap by 53% and a second phase , in 2015 , is to achieve a 61% reduction compared to 2003 levels .
circuit vacated what was widely regarded as the bush administration's most significant environmental measure: the clean air interstate rule ( cair ) .
so 2 emissions cause acid precipitation , and so 2 is also among the pollutants that form fine particles ( pm 2.5 ) in the atmosphere .
for so 2 , the cair program reduces emission allowances in the affected upwind states 50% beginning in 2010 and 65% beginning in 2015 .
ozone aggravates a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions and causes as many as 2,300 premature deaths annually .
nox contributes to both pm 2.5 and to the formation of ground - level ozone .
subsequently , on december 23 , 2008 , the court modified its decision to allow cair to remain in effect while epa fashions a replacement rule .
concentrations of the pollutant need to be reduced in most of the states east of the mississippi , according to epa .
the basic purpose of the rule was to protect downwind states from pollution generated in other states located upwind .
on july 11 , 2008 , in north carolina v. epa , the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c .
these determinations were made within the state implementation plan process of sections 110 ( k ) ( 5 ) and 110 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( d ) of the clean air act .
the act recognizes this and requires that those upwind states control major sources of pollution that affect other states: under section 110 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( d ) , sips must include adequate provisions to prevent sources within a state from contributing significantly to nonattainment in downwind states .
cair was based on a series of determinations by epa with respect to pollution transport , cost - effective pollution control , and compliance feasibility .
many states cannot attain the standards unless upwind states reduce their pollution .
finding that interstate transport of so 2 and nox contributes significantly to ozone and pm 2.5 nonattainment in the majority of eastern states , epa issued the clean air interstate rule ( cair ) in march 2005 to mitigate the problem .
for those pollutants subject to naaqs , it established a partnership in which the federal government sets uniform national air quality standards and the states develop state implementation plans ( sips ) identifying the measures they will take to attain the standards .
the clean air act envisions a mix of state and federal authorities to reduce air pollution .
