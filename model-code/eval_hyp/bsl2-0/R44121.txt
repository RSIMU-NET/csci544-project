of the total revenues that have accrued throughout the program's history ( $40.9 billion ) , less than half have been appropriated ( $18.9 billion ) through fy2019 .
the lwcf receives additional revenue ( beyond the $900 million ) from ocs leasing under the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 ( gomesa ) .
these measures were not enacted .
unlike revenues under the lwcf act , gomesa revenues are mandatory appropriations ( and thus are not subject to annual appropriation by congress ) .
the overall level of annual appropriations ( discretionary and mandatory combined ) has varied widely since the fund's origin in fy1965 .
however , revenues that accrue under the lwcf act are available only if appropriated by congress through the discretionary appropriations process .
for instance , one 115 th congress bill would have authorized lwcf funding for certain programs and activities of the major land management agencies , including deferred maintenance , critical infrastructure , visitor services , and clean - up efforts ; the payments in lieu of taxes program ; and certain offshore energy exploration , innovation , and education activities .
they included proposals to specify an amount or percentage of funding for two programs that are currently funded by the lwcf — the forest legacy program and cooperative endangered species conservation grants — although the lwcf act does not specifically authorize this funding .
a number of measures introduced in recent congresses sought to authorize funding from the lwcf for various other purposes .
some traditional lwcf advocates and beneficiaries have expressed concern about expanding the use of the funds , particularly if such expansion results in lower appropriations for land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states .
it also accumulates revenues from the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales .
as another example , one 115 th congress bill proposed to authorize lwcf funding for financial assistance from the secretary of housing and urban development for park and recreation infrastructure projects .
other proposals sought to authorize programs or activities that have not been funded by lwcf in the past , or that have been rarely funded by lwcf in the past .
some members of congress , presidents , and stakeholders have supported funding other purposes in order to draw on the balance in the fund for policy priorities , to shift the focus of the fund from land acquisition , or to achieve other goals .
to accomplish these goals , purposes of the law included "providing funds" for federal land acquisition and for federal assistance to states generally related to outdoor recreation .
they can be used only for grants to states for outdoor recreation purposes .
thus , the unappropriated balance in the fund is estimated at $22.0 billion through fy2019 .
first , for each year since fy1965 , appropriations for land acquisition have been provided to some or all of the major federal land management agencies — the bureau of land management ( blm ) , fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , national park service ( nps ) , and forest service ( fs ) .
the fund accumulates the majority of its revenues from oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf ( ocs ) .
