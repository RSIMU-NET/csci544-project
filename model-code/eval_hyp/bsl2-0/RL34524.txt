u.s. trade policy also seeks to promote economic growth in developing countries by offering trade preference programs , including the generalized system of preferences ( gsp ) , and the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa ) .
for example , the united states restricts imports from certain countries , including cuba , iran , and north korea , as part of larger foreign policy considerations .
determining a product's country of origin can have significant implications for an imported product's treatment with respect to u.s. trade programs and other government policies .
such policies require that officials make accurate country of origin determinations so that the benefits of the preferential tariff treatment are received and program goals are met .
the report concludes with some policy options for congress that proponents assert could improve the roo process .
these characteristics include the growing complexity of global value chains and , consequently , the increasing demand for fast and efficient movement of intermediate goods across borders to assure competitive prices and profitability .
it then discusses the advantages and disadvantages of u.s. - implemented roo schemes .
certain key characteristics of contemporary globalized manufacturing may also prove challenging to the roo process and implementation .
some observers assert the combined effects of these characteristics have created a globalized manufacturing environment that is sufficiently intricate and flexible to make the application of roo more complex and , at times , potentially misleading .
however , when component parts of a finished product originate in many countries — as is often the case in global industries such as autos and electronics — determining origin can be a complex , sometimes subjective , and time - consuming process .
rules of origin ( roo ) , the methodology used to prove country of origin , are central components of u.s. trade policy .
this report first provides a general overview of the implementation of the u.s. roo system .
such rules can be very straightforward when all of the parts of a product are manufactured and assembled primarily in one country .
however , negotiators sometimes make incremental changes .
some observers assert that preferential roo are inefficient and lack transparency .
some policy observers , however , assert that the worldwide proliferation of trade agreements creates inefficiencies in the trading system because there are so many complex roo frameworks .
nevertheless , the role of roos ( both preferential and non - preferential ) is central to the international trading system and trade negotiations .
others express concern that current u.s. systems for determining country of origin may run counter to overall u.s. trade policy .
for similar reasons , roo are also important when providing unilateral trade preferences to ensure that only goods from eligible countries receive the benefits .
due to their obscure and technical nature , rules of origin frameworks are generally not in the forefront of the continuing debates on trade liberalization or globalization .
however , such efforts may adversely affect importers and manufactures that benefit from the current system .
there are two types of rules of origin ( roo ) : non - preferential roo are used to determine the origin of goods imported from countries with which the united states has most - favored - nation ( mfn ) status , and are the principal regulatory tools for accurate assessment of tariffs on imports , addressing country of origin labeling issues , qualifying goods for government procurement , and enforcing trade remedy actions and trade sanctions .
