in fiscal year 2004 , federal agencies purchased more than $32 billion of products and services through the program .
the multiple award schedules program has grown significantly over the past several years .
through more than 16,000 contracts , federal agencies can directly purchase more than 8 million products from more than 10,000 commercial vendors .
however , unless these actions are effectively implemented the risk of pricing problems will continue .
in conclusion , while gsa's schedules program has provided the government with a more flexible and cost - effective approach to buying commercial items , our work has shown that the program has long been fraught with problems of contract overpricing — resulting in millions of taxpayer dollars being wasted .
in recent years , however , the use of these pricing tools has declined dramatically — despite dramatic increases in program sales .
by delaying action to address its contract pricing problems , gsa continues to miss opportunities to minimize prices paid for goods and services and save significant sums of federal dollars .
each year , federal agencies spend billions of dollars to buy commercial products and professional services through gsa's multiple award schedules program .
we recommended that the gsa administrator ( 1 ) ensure that pre - award audits are conducted when the threshold is met for both new contract offers and contract extensions , ( 2 ) develop guidance to help contracting officers determine when postaward audits are needed , and ( 3 ) direct gsa program management to revise its quality control program to ( a ) determine the underlying causes for contract pricing deficiencies and ( b ) develop appropriate plans to implement corrective actions .
historically , pre - award and postaward audits have proven their value in deterring overpricing and recovering vendor overcharges .
consequently , gsa has less assurance that vendor - supplied pricing information is accurate , complete , and current , and its ability to deter overpricing and recover overcharges has been minimized .
these negotiations have a direct bearing on how economically government agencies procure products and services .
the program is designed to take advantage of the government's significant buying power when purchasing a wide range of commercially available products — such as office furniture and supplies , personal computers , and tools — and a variety of professional services .
we believe that gsa's actions are a good first step toward addressing its long - standing pricing problems with multiple award schedules contracts .
when gsa has used pre - award and postaward audits , it has been able to avoid or recover hundreds of millions of dollars in overcharges .
until gsa takes steps to ensure the appropriate use of available pricing and negotiation tools , it will continue to miss opportunities to save the government hundreds of millions of dollars in the procurement of goods and services .
to get the most out of each taxpayer dollar , gsa seeks to leverage the government's immense buying power by negotiating discounts from the vendor's price list that are equal to or greater than the vendor's most favored customers .
pre - award audits allow gsa contract negotiators to avoid potential vendor overpricing by verifying pricing information before contracts are awarded .
