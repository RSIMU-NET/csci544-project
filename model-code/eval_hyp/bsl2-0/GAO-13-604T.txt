it is now also operating in an environment of growing budgetary constraints , which have already necessitated tough trade - off decisions and will require additional steps to reduce acquisition risk .
since the 2002 national defense authorization act , we have been mandated to prepare annual assessments of mda's progress toward its acquisition goals .
mda plans to spend about $7.5 billion per year through 2018 .
in addition to a recent change in the agency's leadership , mda is responding to the secretary of defense's march 2013 announcement to increase the planned numbers of ground - based interceptors designed to protect the united states as well as to changes in plans for u.s. missile defense in europe .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 required us to report on our assessment of the extent to which mda has achieved its stated acquisition goals and objectives , as reported through their acquisition baselines , and also to include any other findings and recommendations on mda acquisition programs and accountability as appropriate .
since its inception , mda has been operating in an environment of tight time frames for delivering capabilities â€” first with a presidential directive in 2002 and then with a presidential announcement in 2009 on u.s. missile defense in europe .
at the same time , mda is undergoing significant transition .
to assess mda's progress and related challenges , we examined the acquisition accomplishments of individual missile defense programs and supporting efforts that mda is currently developing and fielding .
since mda was established in 2002 , it has spent over $90 billion to provide protection from enemy ballistic missiles by developing battle management systems , sensors that identify incoming threats , and missiles to intercept them .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the progress made and challenges that remain for the department of defense's ( dod ) missile defense agency ( mda ) in developing and fielding the ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) .
this testimony highlights our findings from that report as well as relevant findings from several of our prior reports on missile defense issued from september 2008 through july 2012 , particularly as they relate to the progress mda made this year in reducing acquisition risks and the challenges that still face mda .
we recently issued our report responding to this mandate .
additional information on our scope and methodology is available in our april 2013 and prior issued reports .
we conducted this work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
in recent years , both congress and mda have recognized that conditions have changed and steps need to be taken that reduce acquisition risk , while increasing transparency and accountability .
today , however , initial capability is in place ; mda has begun to transition more mature systems to the military services ; it has had to propose canceling two major efforts in the face of budget reductions , concerns about affordability , and technical challenges ; and the employment of bmds systems is becoming increasingly interdependent , thereby increasing the potential consequences of problems discovered late in the development cycle .
however , especially in light of growing budget pressures , additional actions are needed , including sufficiently analyzing alternatives before making major new investment commitments ; stabilizing acquisition baselines and ensuring they are comprehensive and reliable ; ensuring acquisition strategies allow for the right technical and programmatic knowledge to be in place before moving into more complex and costly phases of development ; and demonstrating new types of targets in less critical tests before they are used in a major test in order to lower testing risks the appointment of a new director provides an opportunity to address these challenges , but doing so will not be easy as mda is still under significant schedule pressures and the agency is undergoing a transition to respond to new secretary of defense direction to expand the gmd capabilities .
