in 2016 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) estimated the average annual gross tax gap for tax years 2008 through 2010 to be $458 billion .
this sector included about 1.3 million religious , charitable , and similar organizations operating in the united states during fiscal year 2017 .
researchers estimated that giving to charitable organizations totaled $410 billion in 2017 or about 2 percent of the u.s. gross domestic product .
when tax - exempt entities such as charities are involved , abusive tax schemes are even more disruptive , as they also erode the public's confidence in the integrity of the charitable sector .
this report ( 1 ) describes ways in which taxpayers have abused an entity's tax exempt status through abusive tax schemes ; ( 2 ) examines trends in irs's compliance efforts and characteristics of taxpayers audited for using abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities ; and ( 3 ) assesses how well irs identifies emerging abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt organizations and what improvements it could make , if any , to that process .
after taking into account its enforcement activities and late payments , irs calculated that the average net tax gap was $406 billion per year .
concurrent with irs's declining resources were increasing responsibilities , such as implementing aspects of the foreign account tax compliance act and the patient protection and affordable care act .
to examine trends in irs's compliance efforts and the characteristics of taxpayers audited for abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities , we collected data from the following irs business operating divisions ( operating divisions ) that conduct audits on abusive transactions: ( 1 ) tax exempt and government entities ( te / ge ) , ( 2 ) small business / self - employed ( sb / se ) , and ( 3 ) large business and international ( lb&i ) .
because of their exemption from federal income tax and the deductibility of charitable contributions made to them , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) entities are sometimes used as vehicles to conduct inappropriate schemes .
consequently , irs must work to identify and address new abusive tax schemes involving charities and other types of tax - exempt entities .
abusive tax schemes used as attempts to evade tax liabilities can be highly technical tax shelters engineered and marketed by firms .
these schemes threaten our tax system's integrity and fairness when taxpayers believe that individuals and businesses are not paying their fair share of taxes .
abusive tax schemes also contribute to the tax gap , which refers to the difference between the taxes people and businesses owe , and what they annually pay voluntarily and on time in the united states .
you asked us to review what is known about abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities and how irs addresses these schemes .
to describe ways in which taxpayers have abused the tax status of a tax - exempt entity , we reviewed research on noncompliance involving tax - exempt entities and irs documentation on abusive tax schemes that could involve tax - exempt entities .
we also conducted interviews with knowledgeable tax , accounting and legal professionals ; relevant researchers ; and former irs officials about schemes that involve tax - exempt entities .
