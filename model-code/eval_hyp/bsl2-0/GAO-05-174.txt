these programs are administered primarily by hud or the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .
since the 1930s , a number of federal housing programs have provided assistance to low - income renters and homeowners , including rent subsidies , mortgage insurance , and loans and grants for the purchase or repair of homes .
in 2003 , about 40 percent of these low - income homeowners were spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing .
this report discusses ( 1 ) the extent to which federal housing assistance programs provide benefits to elderly households and what is known about the effectiveness of these programs in assisting the elderly , ( 2 ) the types of supportive services that these programs provide for the elderly , and ( 3 ) how hud and usda avoid overlap and duplication in programs that offer similar types of housing assistance to the elderly .
like these renters , low - income elderly homeowners also have affordability problems .
we included housing assistance programs that ( 1 ) subsidize mortgage interest rates , rent , or housing repair or rehabilitation ; ( 2 ) provide mortgage insurance , loan guarantees , or direct loans for single - family or multifamily housing ; or ( 3 ) support the construction , rehabilitation , or purchase of multifamily housing or assisted living facilities .
the 2003 american housing survey estimated that 66 percent of low - income elderly renters spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing .
housing affordability is an even greater problem for low - income elderly households â€” those with incomes of less than 80 percent of area median income .
while approximately 80 percent of the elderly own their homes , about two - thirds of these households are considered low income .
whether homeowners or renters , these households were spending more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing .
however , these programs do not reach all needy households , and waiting lists for many types of subsidized housing , including housing for the elderly , are often long .
further , according to a congressionally - established bipartisan commission , decreased investment in affordable housing and a burgeoning elderly population that is projected to grow from about 12 percent of the population in 2002 to 20 percent by 2030 are likely to increase the number of elderly who must spend large portions of their incomes on housing .
you requested that we review federal housing assistance programs that can benefit the elderly .
as requested , we also obtained information on the status of hud's efforts to implement gao's earlier recommendations to improve the timeliness and oversight of the section 202 supportive housing for the elderly ( section 202 ) program , which subsidizes the development of rental housing and provides rental assistance for elderly households with very low incomes .
to address these objectives , we consulted with hud and usda officials to identify housing assistance programs that benefit the elderly .
today , hud administers the majority of federal housing assistance programs in urban areas , and usda's rural housing service ( rhs ) implements housing programs in rural areas .
we reviewed studies and reports by federal agencies , including the hud and usda offices of inspector general ; research institutions ; and others for information on the effectiveness of these programs .
