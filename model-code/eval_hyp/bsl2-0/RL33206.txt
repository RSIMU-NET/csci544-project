in 2008 , hurricanes gustav and ike have caused similar disruptions , renewing concerns about geographic vulnerability .
as the nation's responses to recent natural disasters continue , and as its homeland security activities evolve , congress has been examining federal policies related to the geographic concentration and vulnerability of critical infrastructure .
since september 11 , 2001 , legislators , government agencies , and industry increasingly have been focused on the sources of infrastructure vulnerability and potential measures to address those vulnerabilities through operational changes and capital investment .
109-468 ) require periodic studies to identify geographic areas in the united states where unplanned loss of oil pipeline facilities may cause oil shortages or price disruptions ( sec .
provisions in the pipeline safety improvement act of 2006 ( p.l .
the 110 th congress is overseeing implementation of these measures and considering additional policies which may affect critical infrastructure concentration .
109-58 ) facilitated the construction of new liquefied natural gas import terminals in diverse ports by granting the federal energy regulatory commission exclusive siting approval authority ( section 311 ) .
accordingly , congress has a strong interest in the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to natural hazards , accidents , or terrorism .
the federal government has a key role in helping protect the nation's critical infrastructure from all types of hazards through programs of mitigation , preparedness , response , and recovery .
it reviews several ways in which the federal government has also influenced critical infrastructure , such as prescriptive siting , economic incentives , environmental regulation , and economic regulation .
in 2005 , hurricanes katrina and rita demonstrated this kind of geographic impact by disrupting a substantial part of the national u.s. energy and chemical sectors , both heavily concentrated in the gulf of mexico .
for example , in the 109 th congress , the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .
critical infrastructure is so vital to the united states that its incapacity would harm the nation's physical security , economic security , or public health .
when infrastructure is physically concentrated in a limited geographic area it may be particularly vulnerable to geographic hazards such as natural disasters , epidemics , and certain kinds of terrorist attacks .
whereas a typical geographic disruption is often expected to affect infrastructure in proportion to the size of an affected region , a disruption of concentrated infrastructure could have greatly disproportionate — and national — effects .
prominent among these are legislative proposals such as h.r .
the social and economic impacts of geographic disasters are often difficult to quantify , but their costs can quickly run into the billions and can spread far beyond the area of the event itself .
these forces include resource location , agglomeration economies , scale economies , community preferences , and capital efficiency .
it identifies several long - term forces which have contributed to infrastructure concentration .
extended closure of the port of long beach , the largest port in the nation , would greatly harm california's economy , but could also disrupt vital supply chains for a number of national industries .
the report concludes with options to address geographic vulnerability in the context of current federal infrastructure policy .
