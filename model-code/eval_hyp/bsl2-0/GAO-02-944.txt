the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) , state agencies ( usually departments of education ) , and school food authorities all play a role in administering these school meal programs .
in fiscal year 2001 , the federal government spent about $8 billion in reimbursements for school meals .
some local program managers said that these administrative tasks are burdensome and costly .
to varying degrees , each of these entities performs tasks associated with three of the administrative processes essential to the current operation of the school meal programs: ( 1 ) processing applications , ( 2 ) verifying income eligibility , and ( 3 ) counting the total number of meals served and claiming reimbursement .
however , data on the costs of these tasks are not gathered or maintained .
 ( see app .
because the congress will consider reauthorizing the national school lunch and the school breakfast programs in 2003 , you asked us to develop cost estimates at the federal , state , and local ( school food authorities and schools ) levels associated with processing applications for free and reduced - price meals , verifying eligibility for free and reduced - price meals , and counting all reimbursable meals and snacks and claiming federal reimbursement .
ii for information on program dollars. ) .
the federal government reimburses the states , which in turn reimburse school food authorities ( offices responsible for the administration of the school meals program in one or more schools ) for each meal served .
i for further details about our scope and methodology and app .
to obtain data on the costs of administering these school meal programs , we visited selected locations , including 5 state agencies , 10 school food authorities in public school districts , and 2 schools at each district .
on the basis of this information , we calculated estimated costs relative to program dollars .
we chose sites that would provide a range of characteristics , such as geographical location , size of student enrollment , and type of meal counting system .
any child at a participating school may purchase a meal through these school meal programs , and children from households that apply and meet established income guidelines can receive these meals free or at a reduced price .
we interviewed program managers and staff at these locations to obtain information on tasks associated with the application , verification , and meal counting and reimbursement claiming processes for the 2000-01 school year .
we conducted our work between august 2001 and july 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
we did not verify the information collected for this study ; however , we made follow - up calls in cases where data were missing or appeared unusual .
the results of our study cannot be generalized to schools , school food authorities , or states nationwide because we selected a limited number of sites , which was not a statistical sample .
we also obtained information from officials at fns headquarters and one regional office .
each school day , millions of children receive meals and snacks provided through the national school lunch and the school breakfast programs .
