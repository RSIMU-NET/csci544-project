specifically , for this report we reviewed the corps' ( 1 ) progress in repairing damage to hurricane protection projects by june 1 , 2006 ; ( 2 ) plans and estimated costs to make other repairs , restore levees and flood control structures to design elevations , and complete construction of previously authorized but incomplete portions of five existing hurricane protection projects ; and ( 3 ) plans and estimated costs to add enhancements and strengthen hurricane protection projects for the region .
however , because of the unprecedented damage and loss caused by hurricane katrina , the corps deviated from its usual policy and has funded 100 percent of the repair , restoration , and construction costs for both federal and nonfederal levees and flood control structures .
we have prepared this report under the comptroller general's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative , as part of our continued effort to assist the congress by ( 1 ) monitoring the extensive damage to southeastern louisiana caused by hurricane katrina and ( 2 ) evaluating ongoing efforts to repair and strengthen the region's hurricane protection projects .
the flood control and coastal emergencies act of 1941 , as amended , authorizes the corps to respond in cases where flooding occurs due to a storm and repair or restore flood control and hurricane protection projects including levees , floodwalls , and other flood control structures damaged or destroyed by flood waters .
these projects were designed to provide various levels of hurricane protection , and generally could withstand storms with maximum wind speeds between 87 and 115 miles per hour .
generally , it is corps policy to pay for the full costs of repairs to federally constructed levees and to fund 80 percent of the cost to repair certain nonfederally constructed levees , and the local sponsor or government funds the remaining 20 percent .
over the years , the corps constructed five major hurricane and flood damage reduction projects in southeastern louisiana , comprising about 350 miles of earthen levees and concrete floodwalls across six parishes .
the hurricane protection projects in orleans , plaquemines , and st. bernard parishes suffered the greatest damage from hurricane katrina .
the size and strength of the storm and subsequent flooding resulted in one of the largest natural disasters in u.s. history , as storm waters flowed over floodwalls and breached levees in louisiana's orleans and neighboring parishes , causing widespread flooding , billions of dollars of property damage , and more than 1,300 deaths .
after june 2006 , the corps had planned to repair damaged pumps , pump motors and pump stations , restore all hurricane protection structures that had subsided over time to their authorized design heights ( the elevation specified in their design ) , and complete construction of incomplete portions of previously authorized hurricane protection projects .
after hurricane katrina , the corps stated that it would repair the 169 miles of levees , floodwalls , and other hurricane protection structures damaged by katrina to prestorm conditions by june 1 , 2006 â€” the beginning of the 2006 atlantic hurricane season .
the army corps of engineers ( corps ) began constructing hurricane protection projects in southeastern louisiana almost 60 years ago , in the 1940s .
