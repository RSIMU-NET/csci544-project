since the early 1980s , faa's modernization efforts have experienced lengthy schedule delays and substantial cost overruns .
faa projects that it cannot meet projected traffic increases and make required safety and efficiency enhancements without replacing equipment .
because of such problems , in 1994 , faa restructured its acquisition of the advanced automation system — the long - time centerpiece of its air traffic control modernization program — into more manageable segments .
however , components of the system are aging and are difficult and costly to maintain .
one of these segments is called the standard terminal automation replacement system ( stars ) project .
the federal aviation administration ( faa ) oversees the largest , busiest , and most complex air traffic control system in the world .
specifically , you asked us to determine to what extent ( 1 ) the schedule estimate for stars is attainable and ( 2 ) cost estimates to make stars operational are likely to change .
in september 1996 , faa contracted with raytheon corporation to develop , produce , and install stars .
given faa's past schedule and cost problems and the significance of the stars project , you asked us to examine faa's acquisition planning to date .
this project is expected to replace 15- to 25-year - old computers and related equipment used at faa facilities that track aircraft in the airspace surrounding airports .
faa is aware that these issues pose a risk for stars and has begun several risk mitigation initiatives .
to achieve the implementation schedule approved by the joint resources council in january 1996 , faa will have to obtain commitment from key stakeholders , resolve scheduling conflicts between stars and other terminal modernization efforts , and overcome difficulties in developing the system .
while such actions are encouraging , it is too early to tell how effective they will be .
second , faa will incur costs for upgrading radars .
faa's schedule for stars can be jeopardized by scheduling conflicts with other modernization efforts .
faa plans to modernize the existing analog asr - 8 radars that provide data to its tracons .
faa's january 1996 operations cost baseline is $1.29 billion .
faa officials estimate that the 20-year life - cycle costs for modifying and digitizing all the asr - 8s will be $459 million and for replacing them will be $474 million .
according to faa officials , the estimated cost difference between digitizing existing radars and buying new radars is minimal because of the higher costs of maintaining older analog equipment .
faa has yet to develop estimates for readying the remaining sites .
in the past , poor coordination among key stakeholders has caused schedule delays in other modernization projects at faa .
faa's schedule for developing and implementing stars by its january 1996 approved baseline is shown in table 1 .
because the implementation of stars is approaching , faa is faced with an immediate decision between digitizing these existing analog radars or replacing them with new digital radars .
this possible increase is attributable to expected higher costs for operating and maintaining stars equipment .
faa's january 1996 facilities and equipment cost baseline is $940 million .
