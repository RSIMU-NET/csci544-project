as agreed with your offices , we determined ( 1 ) the status of the itep program and ( 2 ) challenges facing agencies in implementing itep .
opm issued the required implementing regulations in september 2005 .
the office of personnel management ( opm ) is required under the act to issue implementing regulations for the program and to report semiannually to the congress on the operation of the program .
recognizing the importance of human capital to it and the need to improve the skills of the federal it workforce , the congress created the information technology exchange program ( itep ) as part of the e - government act of 2002 ( e - gov act ) .
the program is envisioned as a vehicle to promote the interchange of it employees between federal executive agencies and the private sector and to develop , supplement , and modernize it skills while improving overall competencies in the federal it workforce .
we also conducted interviews with itep officials at the seven participating agencies — department of commerce , department of defense ( dod ) , department of homeland security ( dhs ) , department of the treasury , federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , department of health and human services , and opm — and with the industry advisory council ( iac ) , which includes about 500 companies as members .
recently , assessments of the federal information technology ( it ) workforce , as called for in the clinger cohen act , have resulted in the identification of skills gaps in key areas such as project management .
the act required gao to provide an evaluation of the program by december 17 , 2006 .
to conduct our work , we analyzed itep regulations and guidance , agencies' itep plans , and opm status reports .
opm's regulations require that each participating agency develop an itep plan , approved by the agency head , before proceeding with exchanges .
agencies' opportunity to begin exchanges ends in december 2007 .
reporting to the congress on these challenges and the number of exchanges that have occurred is key to determining the viability of the program and whether it should continue beyond 2007 .
we performed our work from july 2006 to november 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
details of our objectives , scope , and methodology are included in appendix i .
however , given the short time remaining for beginning exchanges , it will be essential to expeditiously address the challenges to enable a significant number of successful exchanges .
agencies will face several challenges in making exchanges , including shortages of employees with key skills and concerns that exchanges could hinder companies' ability to do future business with the government .
we recommend that , as part of opm's responsibilities under the e - gov act , the director of opm include in its semiannual reports to the congress ( 1 ) the number of exchanges that have occurred , as required by law , and ( 2 ) the status of efforts to address challenges facing agencies in implementing itep exchanges and whether these efforts are leading to exchanges .
opm and the participating agencies are aware of the challenges and acknowledge that they need to be addressed .
