however , 360 vessels calling u.s. ports have a fuel capacity over 50,000 barrels and 100 vessels have a fuel capacity over 70,000 barrels .
congress has thus far held three hearings on the accident and has introduced legislation in reaction to the accident .
other , preexisting legislation related to ship navigation is pending ( see the last section of this report ) .
much attention has focused on the timeliness of the coast guard's response to the cosco busan spill , but the accident has also raised questions about oversight of pilot proficiency and the role of vtss in harbor navigation .
ever - larger ships , difficult or challenging slow - speed handling characteristics of some of these ships , and rising port traffic that is increasingly foreign - flagged may be cause for a review of pilotage , vessel traffic services , and other safety - related navigation services in u.s. ports .
while the fuel oil carried by non - tank vessels is a relatively small fraction of the oil carried as cargo in tankers , it is still of sufficient quantity to cause an environmental catastrophe and significant economic loss if spilled .
as a result of tanker safety improvements implemented in the wake of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , the amount of oil spilled by oil tankers has been declining significantly and is now approaching the amount of oil spilled by non - tank vessels .
important policy questions for congress include whether there is a need for further independent oversight of pilot performance ; whether vtss' should operate more like air traffic control centers ; and whether the pilot and ship captain should be required to agree on a passage plan before transiting a harbor ? .
according to the coast guard , the cosco busan has a fuel capacity of 52,000 barrels , larger than the fuel capacity of the majority of ocean - going non - tank vessels calling at u.s. ports which have a fuel capacity between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels .
when accidents occur , the public impact of the oil or fuel spilled can be large , as the cosco busan accident demonstrated .
considering the number of ships transiting u.s. harbors everyday , accidents are rare .
the report's focus is on the prevention of ship collisions and groundings in harbors and thus does not discuss oil spill response and clean - up .
this report describes the role of pilots and vtss in the safe navigation of ships in u.s. harbors and reviews the controversy over the governance of pilot associations , the appropriate level of interaction between the vts and pilot , and other proposals for improving the safety of harbor navigation .
this is largely the result of the skill and expertise of pilots and the navigation support services they receive from vtss .
although several investigations are pending , the suspected cause of the accident is pilot error .
this report also does not discuss the legal liabilities of carriers and mariners in ship accidents .
about three minutes before the accident , but apparently too late to avoid the collision , the san francisco vessel traffic service ( vts ) , which monitors harbor traffic , contacted the ship's pilot .
