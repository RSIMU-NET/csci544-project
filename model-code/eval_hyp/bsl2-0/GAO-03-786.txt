the forest service has a history of financial management problems , including serious accounting and financial reporting weaknesses and an organizational structure that has hampered efforts to correct these weaknesses .
the department of agriculture's ( usda ) office of inspector general ( ig ) and gao have issued many reports over the last several years on the financial challenges facing the agency and the need to correct internal control weaknesses .
however , the forest service continues to face several major challenges for which it has corrective actions underway or planned .
in fiscal year 2002 , the forest service made significant progress toward achieving financial accountability , receiving its first unqualified or “clean” audit opinion on its financial statements .
however , given the nature , scale , and increasing use of purchase cards , it is important for agencies to have adequate internal controls in place to help ensure their proper use and thus help protect the government from fraud , waste , and abuse .
however the report also noted the ( 1 ) lack of supervisory review and approval of cardholder transactions , ( 2 ) delays by cardholders in validating purchase transactions that have been paid , and ( 3 ) inadequate monitoring by agency management .
the use of purchase cards in the federal government has dramatically increased in past years as agencies have sought to streamline the administrative procedures long associated with making small purchases .
since 1999 , we have designated forest service's financial management as a high - risk area on the basis of serious financial and accounting weaknesses that we and the ig have identified .
the benefits of using purchase cards can be lower costs and less paperwork for both the government and the vendor community .
in august 2001 , the ig issued a report on usda's purchase card program that identified several internal control weaknesses .
that review examined 400 fiscal year 1999 and 2000 purchase card and convenience check transactions made by four of usda's agencies , including the forest service .
in response to your request , we initiated a body of work designed to determine whether ( 1 ) existing internal controls at the forest service were designed to provide reasonable assurance that improper purchases would be prevented or detected in the normal course of business , ( 2 ) the forest service's fiscal year 2001 purchase card transactions were made in accordance with established policies and procedures , and ( 3 ) purchases were made for a reasonable cost and reflected a legitimate government need .
given the hundreds of millions of dollars in purchase card purchases made by the forest service each year , these known financial management deficiencies raise the risk that fraudulent or improper purchases could be made by its employees and not detected .
our review focused on the $320 million of disbursements that the forest service made for purchase card transactions during fiscal year 2001 , the most recent fiscal year for which complete data were available when we conducted our review .
based on its review of this limited sample , the ig reported that purchases generally were valid and reasonable .
because of these risks , you requested that we review the forest service's fiscal year 2001 purchase card and convenience check transactions to determine their validity .
