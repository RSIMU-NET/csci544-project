at the federal level , the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) is responsible for overseeing state financial activities and ensuring the propriety of expenditures reported by states for federal reimbursement .
our review assesses whether ( 1 ) cms has an adequate oversight process to help ensure the propriety of medicaid expenditures , ( 2 ) cms adequately evaluates and monitors the results of its oversight process and makes adjustments as warranted , and ( 3 ) the current cms organizational structure for financial management is conducive to effectively directing its oversight process and sustaining future improvements .
how well states manage medicaid finances and how well cms oversees state financial management are important concerns because of the size and nature of the program .
audits of state medicaid finances conducted in accordance with the single audit act of 1984 , as amended , annually identify millions of dollars in questionable or unallowable costs incurred by state medicaid agencies .
states are the first line of defense in safeguarding medicaid financial management , as they are responsible for making proper payments to medicaid providers , recovering misspent funds , and accurately reporting costs for federal reimbursement .
in addition , annual financial statement audits required under the chief financial officers act have identified many internal control weaknesses in regards to cms's oversight of state medicaid financial operations .
during fiscal year 2000 , the medicaid program served about 33.4 million low - income families as well as certain elderly , blind , and disabled persons at a cost of $119 billion to the federal government and $88 billion to the states for program payments and administrative expenses .
in light of these concerns , you requested that we review the adequacy of cms's financial oversight process for medicaid .
the federal government and states share responsibility for the fiscal integrity and financial management of the jointly funded medicaid program .
this report responds to your request .
as a result , cms was not deploying its limited oversight resources efficiently and effectively to detect improper expenditures .
we discussed recent program changes , which significantly increased financial management oversight activities for regional analysts .
establishing clear lines of authority and performance standards for cms oversight would also provide for a more efficient , effective , and accountable medicaid program .
however , these efforts did not specifically consider information on state financial oversight and program integrity activities such as pre - and postpayment detection methods , and payment accuracy studies and initiatives to prevent fraud and abuse , or consider advanced control techniques for detecting improper medicaid payments .
as medicaid expenditures have grown and resources devoted to medicaid financial oversight have decreased , regional financial analysts have faced significant challenges in monitoring state internal controls , providing technical assistance , scrutinizing expenditures , and following up on audit findings for all state medicaid programs .
although cms is responsible for ensuring the propriety of over $100 billion expended annually by the federal government for medicaid , its financial oversight process did not incorporate key standards for internal control necessary to reduce the risk of inappropriate expenditures .
recommendations for 	 to strengthen medicaid internal controls and the financial oversight executive action process that cms has in place to ensure the propriety of medicaid finances , we make the following recommendations to the cms administrator .
