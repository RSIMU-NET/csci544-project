states then submit state implementation plans ( sips ) , which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that are to bring areas into compliance as well as actions for maintaining compliance .
on january 15 , 2013 , epa published its revisions to the naaqs for pm to provide protection against potential health effects associated with short - and long - term exposure to particulates ( including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality ) .
under sections 108-109 of the clean air act ( caa ) , congress mandated that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) set national ambient ( outdoor ) air quality standards ( or naaqs ) for pollutants whose emissions ( 1 ) "may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare" and ( 2 ) "results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources. .
additionally , epa established separate standards for two categories of pm based on size: "fine" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ( referred to as pm 2.5 ) and slightly larger , but still inhalable , particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers ( referred to as pm 10 ) .
epa has identified and promulgated naaqs for six principal pollutants commonly referred to as "criteria pollutants": 1 .
epa also designated five areas in georgia ( including two adjacent counties in alabama and south carolina ) as unclassifiable .
establishing naaqs does not directly limit emissions or directly compel specific emissions controls ; rather , it represents the epa administrator's formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution that will protect public health with an adequate margin of safety .
on april 7 , 2015 , epa published amendments to the final designations for the 2013 pm 2.5 naaqs that were published on january 15 , 2015 .
in the final designation rule as published on january 15 , 2015 , epa had designated 38 counties or portions of counties ( 14 areas ) in six states .
epa last reviewed and revised the pm naaqs in 2006 .
the effective date of april 15 , 2015 ( 90 days from the date of publication ) for the final designation rule remained unchanged .
the final area designations as amended and published in the april 7 , 2015 , federal register encompass 20 counties or portions of counties ( nine areas ) in four states as nonattainment only for the 2013 revised annual pm 2.5 standard .
the statute further requires that epa review the latest scientific studies and either reaffirm or modify previously established naaqs every five years .
promulgation of naaqs sets in motion a process under which the states and epa first identify geographic nonattainment areas ( i.e. , those areas failing to meet the naaqs ) based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data .
