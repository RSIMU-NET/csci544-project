in response to your september 4 , 1997 , letter , we reviewed the effectiveness of faa's year 2000 program , including the reliability of its year 2000 cost estimate .
in 2 years , hundreds of computer systems that are critical to federal aviation administration ( faa ) operations — such as those used to monitor and control air traffic and those used to target airline inspections — could fail to perform as needed unless proper date - related calculations can be assured .
in many systems , the year 2000 could be indistinguishable from 1900 because many systems use only two digits to designate the year .
in this case , both would read “00,” causing systems to malfunction or fail unless corrections are made .
time is running out .
avoiding such emergency measures will require strong , active oversight .
urgent action is imperative to improve the management effectiveness of faa's year 2000 program and thus the likelihood of its success .
specifically , faa has not ( 1 ) assessed the severity of its year 2000 problem and ( 2 ) completed the inventory and assessment of its information systems and their components .
to satisfy this objective , we reviewed and analyzed key faa documents , including ( 1 ) year 2000 guidance and draft performance plan documents , ( 2 ) year 2000 memorandums and cost estimation worksheets , ( 3 ) minutes of faa's year 2000 steering committee , and ( 4 ) the lines of businesses' year 2000 project plans , monthly status reports , and systems assessment documentation .
in assessing actions taken by faa to address the year 2000 problem , our objective was to determine the effectiveness of faa's year 2000 program , including the reliability of faa's year 2000 cost estimate .
faa's delays to date are very troubling .
unless critical renovation , validation , and implementation activities are completed in time , and sound contingency plans are available , faa risks not successfully navigating the change to the new millennium .
faa agreed with our recommendation and has initiated efforts to improve its processes .
faa has not completed key assessment activities , placing it at enormous risk of not achieving year 2000 compliance by january 1 of that year .
yet an approved strategy containing detailed plans , milestones , and valid cost estimates — all vital considerations — is still lacking .
accordingly , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct that the administrator of faa , take the actions necessary to expedite the completion of overdue awareness and assessment activities .
given the rapidly approaching millennium , such delays are no longer acceptable .
such incomplete assessment is cause for concern .
at a minimum , the administrator should finalize an agencywide plan which provides the year 2000 program manager the authority to enforce year 2000 policies and outlines faa's strategy for addressing the year 2000 date change ; assess how its major business lines and the aviation industry would be affected if the year 2000 problem were not corrected in time , and use the results of this assessment to help rank the agency's year 2000 activities , as well as a means of obtaining and publicizing management commitment and support for necessary year 2000 initiatives ; by january 30 , 1998 , complete inventories of all information systems and their components , including data interfaces ; by january 30 , 1998 , finish assessments of all systems in faa's inventory to determine each one's criticality and to decide whether each system should be converted , replaced , or retired ; determine priorities for system conversion and replacement based on establish plans for addressing identified date dependencies ; develop validation and test plans for all converted or replaced systems ; craft year 2000 contingency plans for all business lines to ensure continuity of critical operations ; and make a reliable cost estimate based on a comprehensive inventory and completed assessments of the various systems' criticality and handling needs .
