we also made recommendations concerning operational capability , including that sec require broker - dealers with on - line trading systems to maintain consistent records on system delays and outages and their related causes , disclose the potential for service disruptions on their sites , and have adequate capacity to serve their customers .
concerned about the responsiveness of sec to these recommendations , you asked us to ( 1 ) describe how the on - line trading market has changed in terms of market volume and the level and nature of complaints ; ( 2 ) describe the actions industry regulators — sec , national association of securities dealers regulation inc. , ( nasdr ) ( a national association of securities dealers , inc. ( nasd ) subsidiary ) , and the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) — have taken to develop rules or guidance consistent with our recommendations ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which regulators can enforce these rules or guidance and the likelihood that regulators will be able to identify instances in which broker - dealers do not follow these rules or guidance .
at the time , we recommended that the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) ensure that broker – dealers with on - line channels include on their web sites accurate and complete information in the areas of privacy , trade execution , margin risk , and trading risk .
we also found that broker - dealers were not required to report or consistently record information about outages and delays of their on - line trading systems .
in addition , this report examines the actions the regulators have taken to address issues involving the suitability of investments — an area noted as a growing concern in our last report .
in may 2000 , we reported that broker - dealers with on - line trading systems did not always provide information on their web sites about several key investor protection areas , including privacy , trade execution , margin risk , trading risk , and the potential for service disruptions .
individual investors made about one million on - line trades of equity securities per day during much of 2000 , yet the risks of on - line trading were not always disclosed on broker - dealer web sites .
while many brokerage firms reported having made substantial investments to enhance system performance in the last year , it is too early to say whether these investments will prevent delays and outages during sustained periods of high trading volume .
industry representatives reported that they have invested heavily to improve performance , and broker - dealers told us that delays and outages are less frequent .
these factors may explain the decline in complaints involving access .
among other things , nyse and nasd , ( through nasdr ) regulate market facilities , write rules governing member conduct ( with sec approval ) , examine members for violations of securities laws and sro rules , and discipline members that fail to follow such laws and rules .
sec conducts this oversight by reviewing sro rules , disciplinary actions , and other activities .
in our earlier report , we noted that many firms were experiencing recurrent delays and outages in their on - line trading systems .
