infectious diseases are a continuous threat for reasons that include: ( 1 ) emergence — at times rapid — of new infectious diseases ; ( 2 ) re - emergence of previously - known infectious diseases ; and ( 3 ) persistence of intractable infectious diseases .
the government accountability office ( gao ) has issued several reports dealing with preparedness for , detection of , and response to emerging infectious diseases domestically and internationally , as well as pandemics .
in addition to zika , other examples of emerging infectious diseases include: ebola virus disease , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , influenza , dengue , and chikungunya , among others .
in addition to causing nearly one in five human deaths worldwide , infectious diseases impose a heavy societal and economic burden on individuals , families , communities , and countries .
according to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , infectious diseases continue to emerge and evolve .
emerging infectious diseases represent an ongoing threat to the health and livelihoods of people and animals worldwide .
this statement addresses issues , if any , associated with ( 1 ) the epidemiology and transmission of the zika virus disease , including reporting on the incidence of disease and what is known about its link to microcephaly ; ( 2 ) detection and testing methods ; ( 3 ) methods for mosquito control ; and ( 4 ) the proposed federal research agenda as it relates to the zika virus and zika virus disease .
many advances in medical research and treatments have been made during the last century , but infectious diseases are nevertheless a leading cause of death worldwide .
 ( see appendix 1 for a listing of these reports ) .
changes in human demographics , behavior and land use — among other factors — bring people into closer and more frequent contact with pathogens and are contributing to infectious disease emergence .
there is also an increase in the opportunities for pathogens to jump between animal and human reservoirs .
due to concerns about the potential impact of zika virus disease , you asked us to present our preliminary observations on several issues associated with zika virus disease .
although a possible link between zika virus disease and microcephaly in newborn babies , as well as a link with guillain - barré syndrome in infected adults has been hypothesized , to date , the link has not been firmly established .
this may involve exposure to animal or insect carriers of disease .
zika virus — which at present appears to be primarily transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes — can cause symptoms including fever , rash , conjunctivitis ( red eyes ) , and joint and muscle pain .
to report on these questions , we reviewed relevant peer - reviewed scientific literature , epidemiological alerts , agency documents , and prior gao work from 2003-2016 on related topics such as disease surveillance and emerging infectious diseases ; consulted experts in the fields of virology , infectious diseases , and vector ( mosquito ) control , including industry representatives ; and interviewed officials of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the national institutes of health ( nih ) .
