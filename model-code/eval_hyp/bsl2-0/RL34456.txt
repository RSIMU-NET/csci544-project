however , based on the current international security environment and recent attempts to disrupt transfers of power in other countries , many observers see the united states as lurching toward a period of uncertainty and increased risk ( see appendix b ) .
according to a presidential transition - related report provided to the department of homeland security ( dhs ) by the homeland security advisory committee ( hsac ) , "briefings , research , and recent history have provided an appreciation of the potential vulnerabilities during transition periods .
presidential transitions during times of u.s. involvement in military operations and national security - related activities are not unique to the 2008-2009 presidential transition period ( see appendix a ) .
other activities that the current and incoming administrations and congress may wish to consider undertaking during the presidential transition period include undertaking public outreach efforts to discuss possible risks to the nation , involving the national security representatives of presidential hopefuls in all transition - related discussions , establishing joint advisory councils responsible for addressing all transition - related risks , requiring the director of national intelligence ( dni ) to undertake efforts to support the nation's awareness of risks , reflecting the national security priorities of the new administration in the 2009 budget , passing the fy2009 appropriations without undue delay ; quickly assigning newly elected and existing members of congress to committees focused on national security , holding hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective u.s. national security policies and goals , and holding hearings soon after the inauguration of the new president to determine the administration's national security - related priorities .
while many terrorism experts are concerned about the internal and external threats to the united states during the presidential transition period , the intelligence community is "uncertain what impact [terrorist propaganda] statements will have on the western muslim community and other individuals who are al - qaeda's primary target audience. .
while the mere presence of a upcoming presidential transition does not ensure an incident of national security significance will occur , security experts argue that this window of potential risk is not lost on the enemies of the united states .
at present , the intelligence community assesses that "al - qaida will increase the frequency , sophistication , timeliness and western targeting of its propaganda statements as the united states advances toward the presidential election. .
not only are we [united states] aware that vulnerabilities exist , but our enemies are as well. .
unlike other man - made incidents that may occur with little warning , the presidential transition offers a broadly defined time frame in which an enemy of the united states may decide to undertake an incident of national security significance with the hope of manipulating the electoral process or changing the nation's foreign and domestic policies .
during recent presidential transitions , the current and incoming administrations and congress have traditionally undertaken numerous activities to facilitate a smooth transfer of executive branch power .
some of the actions often taken during presidential transitions include consulting with government and private sector experts who have presidential transition expertise , providing information to the president - elect after the election and prior to the inauguration , offering operational briefings on ongoing national security matters to prospective presidential nominees and their staff , preparing briefings books and policy memos detailing the issues of most concern to the current administration , and expediting security clearances for president - elect transition team members .
