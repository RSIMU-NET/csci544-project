some members have voiced interest in developing alternatives to current polices ( which expire in 2012 ) and incorporating them in the next omnibus farm bill in the 112 th congress or enacting the policies separately before then .
the financial stress of 2009 and similar episodes over the years have led the industry and congress to reconsider how to handle fluctuations in milk prices and financial prospects for dairy farmers .
in calendar year 2009 , the federal government spent more than $1 billion to support the industry through the milk income loss contract ( milc ) program , the dairy product price support program ( dppsp ) , and the dairy export incentive program ( deip ) .
similarly , the administration has been collecting information through the usda - established dairy industry advisory committee ( diac ) .
according to the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , the number of dairy farms in the united states declined from 67,000 to 65,000 during 2009 .
still , financial concerns remain for dairy farmers who lost significant amounts of farm equity during the milk price collapse .
after appeals from dairy farmers for more financial assistance , congress granted another $350 million in october 2009 in the form of supplemental payments to dairy farmers and government purchases of dairy products for domestic feeding programs .
the total fell to 62,500 as of december 31 , 2010 .
as part of groundwork for the next farm bill , the house committee on agriculture held a hearing on dairy policy on april 20 , 2010 .
on march 3 , 2011 , the diac approved its final report with recommendations to secretary of agriculture .
financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009 , brought on largely by sharply lower milk prices , activated standing federal programs to support dairy farmers .
the subsequent decline in milk production and a simultaneous rebound in foreign demand have lifted the farm price for milk .
next , current dairy policy is reviewed .
finally , the report examines options for federal dairy policy being considered by the industry and / or congress .
under financial pressure , many dairy farmers sent milk cows to slaughter and some went out of business .
this report provides background on the u.s. dairy industry , including an overview of dairy farm numbers and industry structure , and a brief history of dairy marketing and policy .
the federal milk marketing order system does not require federal outlays ( i.e. , no direct payments or product purchases ) .
projected spending for dairy programs , assuming no change in law and based on expected market conditions , is approximately $100 million per year , according to the congressional budget office .
in recent years , total costs ranged from zero in fiscal 2008 , when prices were high , to nearly $1 billion in fiscal 2009 , when prices fell sharply ( figure 4 ) .
options to change federal dairy policy and the associated costs / savings may be affected by these projected costs of continuing the current programs , since that "baseline" determines how much funding is "automatically" available within the dairy program without needing additional funds or offsets for any new dairy approaches .
