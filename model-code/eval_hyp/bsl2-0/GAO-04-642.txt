because cost growth has been a persistent problem on a number of nasa programs , you asked us to ( 1 ) identify initial cost estimates in selected nasa programs and any changes in those cost estimates , ( 2 ) assess nasa's cost - estimating processes and methodologies , and ( 3 ) describe any barriers that make it difficult for nasa to improve its cost - estimating processes .
the demanding scientific and technical expectations inherent in nasa's mission create even greater challenges for the agency to control program costs — especially if meeting those expectations requires nasa to reallocate funding from existing programs to support new efforts .
without such information , nasa has consistently developed unrealistic cost and schedule estimates , which , at least in part , are reflected in the cost growth and schedule increases in many of its programs .
the lack of reliable financial and performance information has posed significant challenges to the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) ability to manage its largest and most costly programs effectively .
for nearly 15 years , nasa contract management has been on gao's high - risk list — due in part to nasa's inability to collect , maintain , and report the full cost of its programs and projects .
our review focused on 27 of 68 nasa programs in the development phase as of april 2003 or that completed development in fiscal year 2001 or 2002 .
to assess nasa's cost - estimating processes and methodologies , we conducted a more in - depth review of 10 of the 27 programs , which generally had the highest development cost estimate within five of nasa's seven enterprises .
to achieve these goals , the president proposed spending $12 billion over the next 5 years — about $1 billion of which would come from an increase in nasa's budget , currently $15.4 billion — with the remaining $11 billion being reallocated from existing nasa programs .
our work was conducted between february 2003 and march 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
developing reliable cost estimates has been difficult for agencies across the federal government .
nasa's unreliable cost estimates have significant implications for potential future endeavors , such as those outlined by the president in january of this year .
as part of these initiatives , the president calls for changes to the budget process to better measure the real cost and performance of programs .
the need for reliable cost estimates is at the heart of two of the five - governmentwide initiatives in the 2002 president's management agenda ( pma ) ; the two are “improved financial performance” and “budget and performance integration.” these initiatives are aimed at ensuring that federal financial systems produce accurate and timely information to support operating , budget , and policy decisions and that budgets are performance - based .
nasa has initiated several measures to begin addressing some of these impediments .
for a complete description of our scope and methodology , see appendix i .
there are several impediments that nasa needs to overcome to implement effective cost - estimating practices .
more than half of the programs' development cost estimates increased , and for some programs , this increase was significant .
