this report responds to your request to review how dhs has coordinated law enforcement resources across law enforcement partners to improve northern border security and made progress in addressing past coordination challenges .
dhs and gao have also reported long - standing coordination challenges between cbp's office of border patrol ( border patrol ) and ice , ice and dea , and border patrol and forest service that may impede achieving border security goals .
what progress has dhs made in securing the northern border , and to what extent has dhs used its partnerships and coordination efforts to address dhs's reported border security vulnerabilities ? .
however , it is unclear the extent to which these efforts are addressing border security gaps , and in november 2008 we reported that dhs had not linked its initiatives to the border vulnerabilities it had identified or informed congress about additional resources needed to secure the northern border .
to facilitate partnerships and coordination , dhs has established various mechanisms — such as interagency forums and agreements — to improve information sharing necessary to achieve a common understanding of the border security threats and to leverage resources for achieving an integrated law enforcement response .
historically , the united states has focused attention and resources primarily on the u.s. border with mexico , which continues to experience significantly higher levels of drug trafficking and illegal immigration than the u.s. - canadian border .
similarly , the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , within the department of justice ( doj ) , conducts investigations of priority drug trafficking organizations , domestic and foreign , that can include drug smuggling across the border or ports of entry .
dhs reported spending nearly $3 billion in its efforts to interdict and investigate illegal northern border activity in fiscal year 2010 , annually making approximately 6,000 arrests and interdicting approximately 40,000 pounds of illegal drugs at and between the northern border ports of entry .
dhs has established partnerships with other federal , state , local , tribal , and canadian law enforcement agencies to secure the northern border , and taken action to improve coordination among its components and across its partners .
within dhs , u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is the frontline agency responsible for interdiction of persons and contraband crossing the border illegally , and u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is responsible for investigating the source of cross - border crimes and dismantling illegal operations .
specifically , we answered the following questions: according to selected northern border security partners , to what extent has dhs improved federal coordination of border security intelligence and enforcement operations with state , local , tribal , and canadian law enforcement partners ? .
other federal , state , local , tribal , and canadian law enforcement agencies also have responsibilities to detect , interdict , and investigate different types of illegal activity within certain geographic boundaries .
securing the northern border is the primary responsibility of various components within dhs , in collaboration with other federal , state , local , tribal , and canadian law enforcement agencies .
to what extent has dhs made progress in addressing past coordination challenges between border patrol and ice , and across dea and forest service in different locations across the northern border , according to selected northern border security partners ? .
