this report examines the extent to which ( 1 ) onrr reported meeting its compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 , ( 2 ) onrr's process for selecting compliance cases aligned with the agency's compliance goals , and ( 3 ) strac members are satisfied with onrr's efforts to coordinate with them and whether strac members' case selection processes align with onrr's compliance goals .
to address all of these objectives , we reviewed onrr's budget justifications , guidance , project work plans , and reports for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 .
you asked us to review issues related to onrr's federal oil and gas royalty compliance efforts .
to examine the extent to which onrr reported meeting its compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 , we reviewed agency documents , including annual budget justifications , annual performance reports , and annual performance plans .
to assess its compliance program's performance , onrr established annual compliance goals that have changed several times over the last decade and include measures that identify the percentage of royalties that onrr's compliance activities cover and the return on investment for those activities .
over the past approximately 10 years , we , interior's office of inspector general ( oig ) , and interior's royalty policy committee have raised concerns about whether onrr is collecting all royalties that are owed to the federal government .
we rely on interior's status of recommendations information on the subcommittee's recommendations , as the subcommittee did not have a process to track their implementation .
we did not assess whether interior's actions were sufficient to close the recommendations as implemented but provide the oig's status of recommendations for its report .
onrr's compliance program also directly coordinates with the members of the state and tribal royalty audit committee ( strac ) , which have programs that review the accuracy of royalties paid for oil and gas extracted on federal lands within their respective states and receive a portion of such royalties .
we also reviewed fiscal years 2010 through 2017 agency data on compliance activities , including the types and numbers of compliance activities conducted .
in february 2011 , in part because of the challenges identified in our past work , which indicated that interior did not have reasonable assurance that it was collecting its share of revenue from oil and gas produced on federal lands , we added interior's management of federal oil and gas resources to our list of programs at high risk for fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement .
under this program , onrr initiates compliance activities by selecting companies and properties for review to assess the accuracy of their royalty data and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations .
to accomplish this , interior tasks its office of natural resources revenue ( onrr ) with collecting and verifying the accuracy of royalties paid by companies that produce oil and gas from over 26,000 federal leases .
we also interviewed onrr officials in the agency's headquarters in lakewood , colorado , and at its offices at interior in washington , d.c. additionally , we reviewed onrr documentation regarding its efforts to implement recommendations from interior's oig and interior's subcommittee on royalty management .
