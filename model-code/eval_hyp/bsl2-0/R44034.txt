these are related to regional and global terrorism ; efforts to stabilize neighboring afghanistan ; nuclear weapons proliferation ; pakistan - india tensions and conflict ; democratization and human rights protection ; and economic development .
the u.s. government has sought to help develop pakistan's economy and boost the effectiveness of its security forces .
while such assistance has contributed to some successes , pakistan remains racked by militancy and terrorism , and is suffering through an extended period of domestic insecurity and weak economic growth .
islamabad has been among the leading recipients of u.s. foreign assistance in the 21 st century , receiving more than $20 billion in overt transfers since 2001 .
congress subsequently made existing conditions on aid both more rigorous and expanded them to include all forms , economic and military , alike .
senior u.s. officials commonly emphasize that the united states has vital interests at stake in u.s. engagement with pakistan .
as a haven for numerous islamist extremist and terrorist groups , and with the world's fastest growing arsenal of nuclear weapons , pakistan is at the top of many governments' international security agendas .
this has been among the most important u.s. foreign policy efforts in the post - 9 / 11 period .
in 2009 , the 111 th congress formally endorsed a policy approach to pakistan that would demonstrate a u.s. commitment to "strategic" ties with that country backed by ample , condition - free economic aid meant to benefit all strata of pakistani society .
this tack was intended to transcend what had until then been perceived as engagement almost wholly based on security and military - to - military ties .
today , some members urge an outright cutoff of aid , while others seek a new and more punitive approach , given a perception that islamabad has "failed to combat terrorists. .
the stated policy of the united states is to assist the creation of a more stable , democratic , and prosperous pakistan that is actively combating religious militancy .
however , 2011 was marked by a series of crises in the relationship , leading to serious rancor in both capitals and open talk of a "divorce" by year's end .
what congressional actions might bolster such efforts ? .
has the u.s. sale and granting of major military supplies to pakistan over the past 15 years substantively improved that country's counterterrorism capabilities ? .
the action has buoyed u.s. officials' confidence in pakistan's cooperation with international efforts to stabilize afghanistan .
are pakistan's civilian government and military playing sufficiently positive roles in efforts to stabilize afghanistan ? .
are pakistan's governmental and civil society institutions making effective efforts to combat the spread of religious extremism and militancy there ? .
in june 2014 , after years of u.s. government prodding , the pakistani military launched major offensive operations against islamist militant groups sheltered in the country's remote federally administered tribal areas ( fata ) abutting afghanistan .
are u.s. national security interests well served when the administration exercises its authority to waive congressionally mandated restrictions on assistance ? .
long - held doubts about islamabad's commitment to core u.s. interests deepened over the course of 2011 , with u.s officials more often describing pakistan's military and intelligence services as too willing to distinguish among islamist extremist groups , maintaining links to afghan insurgent and anti - india militant organizations operating from pakistani territory as a means of promoting what pakistan perceives to be its security interests .
