although most grantees indicated that lsc's revised case reporting guidance has clarified reporting requirements for grantees , many grantees remained unclear about certain aspects of lsc's reporting requirements .
grantees reported changing their policies and procedures to comply with lsc's new reporting requirements .
in light of these findings , we were asked to determine ( 1 ) what efforts lsc and its grantees have made to correct case reporting problems , and ( 2 ) whether these efforts are likely to resolve the case reporting problems that occurred in 1997 .
in a june 1999 report , we estimated that nearly 75,000 of the approximately 221,000 cases reported to lsc by 5 of its largest grantees were questionable .
problems existed with lsc's self - inspection , which sought to verify the accuracy of 1998 case service reporting ( csr ) data .
during the past year , both the lsc office of the inspector general ( oig ) and we identified misreporting by grantees on both the number of cases they closed during calendar year 1997 and the number they had open at the end of that year .
we made eight recommendations to help lsc improve the accuracy of future csr reports .
in a report issued earlier this month we found the following: lsc revised its written case reporting guidance and issued a new handbook to its grantees to clarify case reporting requirements .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss two reviews that we have completed pertaining to case service reporting by the legal services corporation ( lsc ) .
we believe that more needs to be done to correct reporting problems at lsc .
lsc's 1999 csr handbook and other written communications have improved the clarity of reporting requirements for its grantees .
grantees may receive additional funding from non - lsc sources .
we do not believe that lsc's actions , to date , have been sufficient to fully resolve the case reporting problems that occurred in 1997 .
however , many grantees remained unclear about and / or misunderstood certain aspects of the reporting requirements .
in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 , lsc received appropriations of $283 million and $300 million , respectively .
the 1999 csr handbook included changes to ( 1 ) procedures for timely closing of cases ; ( 2 ) procedures for management review of case service reports ; ( 3 ) procedures for ensuring single recording of cases ; ( 4 ) requirements to report lsc - eligible cases , regardless of funding source ; and ( 5 ) requirements for reporting cases involving private attorneys separately .
lsc sought to determine the accuracy of grantees' 1998 case statistics by requiring grantees to conduct self - inspections .
lsc provides the assistance indirectly , through grants to about 260 competitively selected local programs .
lsc's practice of disseminating guidance primarily by written or telephone communications may not be sufficient to ensure that grantees correctly and consistently interpret the requirements .
the validity of the results are difficult to determine because lsc did not standardize the way that grantees were to report their results , some of the grantees used samples that were too small to assess the proportion of error in their data , some grantees did not correctly follow lsc's reporting guidance , and lsc had done no verification of the grantees' self - inspection procedures .
