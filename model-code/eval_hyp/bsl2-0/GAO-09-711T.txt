today , i will discuss ( 1 ) current jsf cost and schedule estimates ; ( 2 ) issues concerning the alternate engine program ; ( 3 ) manufacturing performance ; ( 4 ) contracting issues for procurement of production aircraft ; and ( 5 ) development test plans .
our most recent report in march of this year discussed increased development costs and schedule , plans to accelerate procurement , manufacturing performance and delays , and the development test strategy .
the department believes that the program is well managed , has the proper amount of oversight , and is well positioned to manage heightened risks and successfully accomplish this mission .
the total expected u.s. investment is now more than $300 billion to develop and procure 2,456 aircraft over the next 25 years .
the jsf program is entering its most challenging phase as it plans to deliver test assets , significantly step up flight testing , begin verifying mission system capabilities , mature manufacturing processes , and quickly ramp up production of operational aircraft .
a recurring theme in our work has been concern about what we believe is undue concurrency of development , test , and production activities and the heightened risk it poses to achieving good cost , schedule , and performance outcomes .
the department acknowledges the substantial concurrency and risk , but approves of it , hoping to replace aging legacy aircraft with this fifth generation strike aircraft as quickly and efficiently as possible .
gao has issued 5 annual reports on the jsf .
the jsf is critical to our nation's plans for recapitalizing the tactical air forces and will require a long - term commitment to very large annual funding outlays .
this statement draws primarily from our march 2009 report , updated to the extent possible with new budget data and a recently revised procurement profile directed by the secretary of defense .
the jsf is the department of defense's ( dod ) most costly acquisition program , seeking to simultaneously develop , produce , and field three aircraft variants for the air force , navy , marine corps , and eight international partners .
procurement budget requirements for that plan were projected to be over $12 billion per year during peak production .
the new plan will require increased annual procurement funding over the next 6 years , but officials did not assess its net effect on total program costs through completion of jsf acquisition .
the new fiscal year 2010 procurement budget requests funding of $6.8 billion for 30 jsf aircraft , a unit cost of $227 million .
dod is also significantly increasing annual procurement rates and plans to buy some aircraft sooner than reported last year .
by accelerating procurement , dod hopes to recapitalize tactical air forces sooner and mitigate projected future fighter shortfalls .
dod's 2010 budget request did not include this funding .
information about the alternate engine program comes largely from our testimony in 2008 .
i am very pleased to be here today to discuss the f - 35 joint strike fighter ( jsf ) program .
at that time , dod planned to ramp up procurement to reach a maximum of 130 aircraft per year by fiscal year 2015 ( u.s. quantities only ) and sustain this rate for 8 years .
