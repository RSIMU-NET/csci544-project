under federal acquisitions law , there are clear government - wide training requirements for the acquisitions workforce intended to help ensure its quality and effectiveness .
federal outlays for grants to state and local governments totaled approximately $545 billion in fiscal year 2012 , comprising over 15 percent of all federal outlays .
in fiscal year 2012 , the federal government spent approximately $28 billion more on grants to state and local governments than it did on federal acquisitions .
the value of these grants has grown considerably over the years , rising from $91 billion in fiscal year 1980 ( about $225 billion in fiscal year 2012 constant dollars ) — a real , inflation - adjusted increase of more than 140 percent .
however , similar government - wide training requirements do not exist for the grant workforce .
in this report , we ( 1 ) describe the federal grant workforce at selected agencies and analyze the challenge of identifying the workforce government - wide and ( 2 ) examine selected good practices agencies use and challenges they face , if any , in training the grant workforce , and the potential implications of these practices and challenges for a government - wide approach toward developing grants management competencies , training , and certification .
to obtain illustrative examples of experiences , challenges , and good practices in training the grant workforce , we selected four agencies — the departments of education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , state ( state ) , and transportation ( dot ) .
given the role federal grants play in achieving national objectives , as well as grants' considerable growth in value and complexity over the past three decades , it is important that the federal workforce that manages these grants has the necessary knowledge and skills to do its job .
in this regard , the government's approach to another tool it uses to achieve goals — purchasing goods and services through federal contracts — provides an interesting contrast .
in light of this , you asked us to examine how the federal government trains its grant workforce and what challenges , if any , exist .
grants are a key tool used by the federal government to achieve a wide variety of national objectives such as providing medical , financial , housing , and foreign assistance , as well as constructing and maintaining our nation's highways , bridges , and mass transit systems .
to obtain a government - wide perspective , we reviewed federal employee data from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) online fedscope information system that supports statistical analyses of federal human resources data , administered a questionnaire to the chief learning officers ( clo ) at 22 federal agencies with an active grant workforce , and reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from the office of management and budget ( omb ) and opm .
in addition , these agencies manage a variety of grant types , including formula , block , and project grants , and cover a broad range of areas including health , education , and transportation , among others .
the four agencies we selected account for 84 percent of total grant dollars and 61 percent of total discrete grants awarded in fiscal year 2012 .
