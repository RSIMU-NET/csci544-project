house report 113-102 , accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 , mandated gao to report to the congressional defense committees on dod's efforts to improve the accuracy of its real property database and the effect of those efforts on dod's consolidation activities .
we made two recommendations to dod , with which it partially concurred , related to improving its data and developing strategies and measures to enhance the management of its facilities , as discussed later in this report .
we also found that dod's plans to eliminate excess facilities in the future were unclear , as were its plans for taking into account external factors , such as management of historical - preservation requirements and environmental restrictions , which affect the disposal of long - standing excess facilities that were identified before fiscal year 2008 .
for example , we found that dod had not defined the strategies and measures it intended to employ to eliminate excess facilities on its installations .
we concluded that , to the extent that dod has identified unutilized and underutilized facilities , additional cost savings might be realized through the consolidation or disposal of such real property inventory .
since 1997 , we have designated the department of defense's ( dod ) support infrastructure management as a high - risk area , in part due to the challenges dod faces in reducing excess and obsolete infrastructure .
this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) osd has improved the completeness and accuracy of facility utilization data in its real property assets database , and the military departments use the data contained in their respective real property inventory databases to identify potential consolidation opportunities ; and ( 2 ) osd has a strategic plan to manage dod's real property efficiently and to facilitate the identification of unutilized and underutilized facilities .
gao , excess facilities: dod needs more complete information and a strategy to guide its future disposal efforts , gao - 11-814 ( washington , d.c.: sept. 19 , 2011 ) .
the operation and maintenance of unutilized and underutilized facilities consumes valuable resources that could be eliminated from dod's budget or used by dod for other purposes .
dod manages a global real property portfolio that , according to dod , as of the end of fiscal year 2012 consisted of more than 557,000 facilities ( buildings , structures , and linear structures ) , located on over 5,000 sites worldwide , covering more than 27.7 million acres , and with a value of approximately $828 billion .
an active status .
we assessed the reliability of dod's real property inventory data by ( 1 ) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness , ( 2 ) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them , and ( 3 ) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data .
to better enable dod to manage its real property inventory effectively and efficiently , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment to establish a strategic plan as part of a results - oriented management framework that includes , among other things , long - term goals , strategies to achieve the goals , and use of metrics to gauge progress to manage dod's real property and to facilitate dod's ability to identify all unutilized or underutilized facilities for potential consolidation opportunities .
