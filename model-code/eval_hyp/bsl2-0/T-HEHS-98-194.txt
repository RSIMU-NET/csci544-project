more specifically , 3 years ago , va began to transform its health care system , in response to market changes and budgetary pressures , to make it more competitive with other health care providers .
we have also examined the relationships between va's health care role and that of other public and private health benefits programs , including the effects changes in those programs could have on va health care .
in addition , the networks are planning to develop and implement additional efficiency initiatives over the next 5 years .
va's success also will depend on its ability to overcome several management and implementation challenges .
but va faces several challenges before completing its transformation .
to aid this transformation , the congress provided new revenue sources and reformed veterans' eligibility for care and va's ability to purchase services from other providers .
of these , va's decisions concerning existing infrastructure may be the most significant and contentious .
over the last 75 years , however , this health care role has evolved from rehabilitating disabled wartime veterans to also providing a health care safety net for peacetime veterans .
my comments this morning will focus on how va's system transformation is progressing and what challenges va faces as its role evolves .
today va is positioning itself as a competitive health care alternative for all veterans .
accessibility and quality of care .
the information we are providing is based on a series of studies we conducted over the past several years to identify ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of va's health care system .
it is essential that va address these infrastructure and other management challenges .
these challenges include designing an enrollment system , establishing new provider networks , developing and awarding potentially complex health care service contracts , improving collections from other health insurance that veterans and others have , and developing systems sufficient to capture critical cost , access , and quality information for managing and evaluating system performance .
this year , va will serve about 2.9 million of the nation's 26 million veterans , at a cost of $19 billion .
for example , va has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the last decade constructing and renovating inpatient capacity .
the united states has a long tradition of providing health care to veterans injured in military service .
va's decisions to consolidate inpatient medical care at fewer locations are complicated by such challenges as va's long - standing relationships with universities' medical schools for education and research , and with the department of defense ( dod ) for contingency medical support .
some of this capacity is no longer needed because of its decreasing reliance on inpatient services .
in our view , va's future success in fulfilling its health care role , as envisioned by recent eligibility reforms , depends in large part on its ability to transform its current delivery infrastructure into an integrated system of va and private sector providers , which may be more attractive to new users , especially those already insured , who could provide va with an additional source of revenue .
va operates one of our nation's largest health care systems , including 400 service delivery locations and 183,000 employees .
