while dod has embarked on a series of efforts to reform its business operations , serious challenges and inefficiencies remain .
at the same time , weapons programs are commanding more and more resources as dod undertakes increasingly ambitious efforts to transform its ability to confront current and potential threats .
given current policies , in the next few decades the nation will face large and growing structural deficits due to known demographic trends , rising healthcare costs and current revenue - to - expenditure gaps .
with dod spending well over $250 billion annually to acquire products and services , prudence with taxpayer funds , widening deficits , and growing long - range fiscal challenges demand that dod maximize its return on investment and provide the warfighter with needed capabilities at the best value for the taxpayer .
some of these issues are long - standing ; for example , we have identified dod weapon systems acquisition and contract management as high - risk areas for more than a decade .
further , managing dod is a challenge as it is one of the world's largest and most complex organizations , spending billions of dollars each year to sustain key business operations that support our forces .
in fact , eight individual areas that gao considers to be high risk because of their greater vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , abuse and mismanagement are specific to dod .
while dod has acknowledged its vulnerabilities and taken some actions to address them , many of the initiatives are still in their early stages and it is too soon to tell what impact they may have .
my testimony will focus on ( 1 ) dod's recent contracting trends , such as the spending on goods and services and the environment in which this activity takes place ; and ( 2 ) selected practices which undermine dod's ability to establish solid business arrangements , particularly those involving the selection and oversight of dod's contractors and incentivizing their performance .
further , there are numerous factors that can contribute to poor acquisition outcomes , which in turn erode dod's buying power .
several elements are essential to achieving this objective , including a sound business case supporting executable programs , sound business arrangements , and clear lines of responsibility and accountability .
dod needs to ensure that its funds are spent wisely , and , in doing so , it needs to ensure that it is buying the right things , the right way .
in a report issued in july , we concluded that , with awards to contractors large and growing , dod will continue to be vulnerable to contracting fraud , waste or misuse of taxpayer dollars , and abuse .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss challenges that the department of defense ( dod ) faces to achieving better acquisition outcomes .
my testimony today is based on work we have completed over the past 6 years that covered a range of acquisition and contracting issues and which was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
at times , dod has allowed new requirements to be added well into the acquisition cycle , significantly stretching technology and creating design challenges , and exacerbating program budget overruns .
