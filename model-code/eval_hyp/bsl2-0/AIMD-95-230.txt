at your request , we have reviewed ( 1 ) dia construction cost growth , ( 2 ) differences between dia's financial consultant's report and audited financial statements relating to denver airport system's bond debt , and ( 3 ) securities and exchange commission ( sec ) jurisdiction over municipal bonds and the status and scope of its dia investigation .
under construction since september 1989 , the $4.8 billion denver international airport ( dia ) opened for business on february 28 , 1995 .
to respond to your request , we reviewed construction cost reports and related information , we examined the financial consultant's report and audited financial statements , and we reviewed legislation and sec regulations pertaining to municipal financing .
in addition , as you also requested , we plan to send you a separate report at a later date on cash flows and operating results from dia operations .
we held extensive discussions with dia and sec officials on the issues presented in this report .
the first formal construction budget , set at $2.08 billion , was produced in may 1990. financing for dia has included about $508 million from the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in grants and facilities and equipment funds , and about $3.8 billion in bonds sold to the public .
other major cost categories are $915 million in capitalized interest ; $599 million in costs of facilities paid for by airlines , faa , and rental car companies ; and $261 million for land acquisition and project planning .
dia has attracted enormous local and national media attention , much of it focused on the various investigations that have been conducted on the airport .
in addition to the work being done by the sec , several other reviews and investigations have been undertaken , including a federal bureau of investigation inquiry into contracting practices , the department of transportation inspector general's review of the possible misapplication of airport revenues , and the denver district attorney's investigations of contracting and construction practices .
the total cost of dia is about $4.8 billion , about $3 billion of which are construction costs incurred by the city of denver .
since may 1990 , 12 airport revenue bond sales have been completed , with the most recent sale of $329.3 million of bonds in june 1995 .
this $620 million construction cost increase resulted from widening and lengthening concourses ( $250 million ) ; the initial costs for the automated baggage system ( $200 million ) ; and other changes including completion of the terminal , electronic upgrades , apron improvements , and partial grading of a sixth runway ( $170 million ) .
we also reviewed sec's legal foundation for jurisdiction over municipal financing and compared federal securities laws to colorado securities laws .
the antifraud provision in colorado's statute mirrors the federal antifraud provisions .
other actions taken by sec in recent years have strengthened its stance on the quality of disclosures demanded of municipal bond issuers .
this 16-month delay increased capitalized interest for the project by about $300 million .
construction costs grew from a may 1990 budget of $2.08 billion to a total at airport opening of $3.004 billion , resulting from several substantial scope changes in the project .
