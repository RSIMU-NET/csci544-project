studies have also been conducted by industry organizations to better understand the decisions plan sponsors make in managing their 401 ( k ) plans .
our past work has shown that the amount of plan fees paid by participants can significantly reduce retirement savings and is dependent on several factors , including the decisions made by the plan sponsor to hire service providers — outside entities to help administer their plans .
to answer these questions , we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations pertaining to 401 ( k ) fees and fee disclosure .
however , these studies are generally based on surveys of larger plans — those with more than 500 participants — and most have not specifically focused on the fees charged by plan service providers .
what actions has the department of labor ( labor ) taken to help plan sponsors understand and monitor fees charged by service providers ? .
as a result , uncertainty remains about the fees paid by small and medium - size plans , which account for the majority of all 401 ( k ) plans , and about the level of knowledge and expertise sponsors of these plans have to determine the fees charged by service providers .
we interviewed labor , sec , and internal revenue service ( irs ) officials ; industry experts ; plan sponsors ; and service providers about factors that affect the amount of 401 ( k ) fees that can be charged to sponsors and participants as well as current and proposed regulations and the requirements governing the disclosure of fee information .
as american workers have increasingly come to rely on their 401 ( k ) plans for retirement income , policymakers have focused their attention on the fees charged to the plan sponsor — typically the employer offering the plan — and plan participants .
we also reviewed research and available guidance provided to plan sponsors by labor and the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , and industry research related to understanding and disclosing fee information .

plan sponsors and other plan fiduciaries have specific responsibilities under erisa .
to help strengthen labor's ability to oversee 401 ( k ) plans , we recommend that in addition to labor's ongoing efforts , labor should evaluate whether individuals and service providers who exert significant control over the plan should be considered erisa fiduciaries .
consequently , you asked us to survey sponsors of small , medium - size , and large plans with different characteristics , such as total plan assets , geographic distribution , and nature of business , to collect information on the following: 1 .
what , if any , challenges do sponsors face in understanding how fees are charged to their plan ? .
to obtain information about the fees sponsors pay for services performed by providers , the factors they considered in selecting service providers , and labor resources they may have used during calendar year 2010 , we conducted a representative survey of 401 ( k ) plan sponsors .
