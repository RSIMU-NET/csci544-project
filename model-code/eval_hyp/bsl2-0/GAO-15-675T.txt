the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments , which often suffered from ineffective management , and spending on it operations is inefficient .
from october 2009 through december 2014 , we made 737 recommendations to address weaknesses in agencies' it management .
in light of these ongoing challenges , we recently added improving the management of it acquisitions and operations to our list of high - risk areas for the federal government .
as you know , the effective and efficient acquisition and management of it investments has been a long - standing challenge in the federal government .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent designation of information technology ( it ) acquisitions and operations as a government - wide high - risk area , as well as the impact of recently enacted federal it acquisition reform legislation ( commonly referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act or fitara ) .
my statement today will discuss this high - risk designation , as well as plans for implementing fitara and those plans' impact on it acquisition reform .
the recent it reform legislation holds promise for improving agencies' acquisition of it , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) is developing guidance for agencies to implement its provisions .
implementation of these initiatives has been inconsistent , and more work remains to demonstrate progress in achieving it acquisition outcomes .
this area highlights several critical it initiatives in need of additional congressional oversight , including reviews of troubled projects , an emphasis on incremental development , a key transparency website , reviews of agencies' operational investments , and efforts to streamline agencies' portfolios of it investments .
federal it projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance .
this has also been highlighted by congress â€” the recently enacted law reforming federal it acquisition is intended to , among other things , strengthen cio authority and provide the oversight it projects need .
although the executive branch has undertaken numerous initiatives to better manage the more than $80 billion that is annually invested in it , federal it investments too frequently fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages , while contributing little to mission - related outcomes .
implementing these provisions , along with our outstanding recommendations , is necessary for agencies to demonstrate progress in addressing this high - risk area .
the federal government invests more than $80 billion annually in it , but many of these investments fail to meet cost and schedule expectations or make significant contributions to mission - related outcomes .
a more detailed discussion of the objectives , scope , and methodology of this work is included in each of the reports on which this testimony is based .
we conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
executive - level governance and oversight across the government has often been ineffective , specifically from chief information officers ( cio ) .
these and other failed it projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined and effective management , such as project planning , requirements definition , and program oversight and governance .
