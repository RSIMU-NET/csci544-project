often , however , congressional delegations of authority are imprecise , and , as a result , agencies must construe ambiguous terms and make interpretive decisions in order to implement congress's delegation .
under chevron then , it is generally left to federal agencies , and not the courts , to resolve ambiguities necessary to interpret and implement authority provided to the agency by congress .
the chevron test , which has been cited and followed thousands of times by federal courts since 1984 , requires courts to enforce the clearly expressed intent of congress .
the supreme court , in chevron u.s.a. , inc. v. natural resources defense council , outlined a limited role for courts in reviewing these types of agency interpretations .
this report will discuss the chevron decision ; explain when chevron deference applies ; highlight common agency statutory interpretations that generally do not receive deference under chevron ; and review the recent supreme court opinion in city of arlington v. fcc which clarified the applicability of chevron deference to circumstances in which an agency is interpreting the scope of its own jurisdiction .
in the absence of such clarity , chevron instructs reviewing courts to defer to an agency's construction of an ambiguous statute if the agency's interpretation is reasonable .
an administrative agency may generally only exercise that authority which is provided to it by congress .
although courts are called to reconcile political preferences in certain circumstances , they should not do so when the power to implement the statute has been delegated to an administrative agency .
finally , administrative agencies are politically accountable — though not directly — through the democratic process .
agencies and legislators are best suited to balance applicable considerations and to resolve debates regarding competing , acceptable interpretations of an ambiguous delegation .
the court noted that an administration has the authority to implement its policy judgments through the permissible interpretation of a statute .
courts , on the other hand , lack such expertise .
second , agencies have technical expertise in the field in which they are acting , and are therefore in a better position to make appropriate policy decisions as part of a large and complex regulatory scheme .
first , the court noted that when congress enacts an ambiguous statutory delegation , it has , in effect , delegated to the agency it has empowered the authority to clarify the ambiguity .
the supreme court elucidated several reasons for favoring a restrained judicial role while granting deference to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute .
congress made a conscious choice in selecting a specific agency to implement the statutory delegation , and the courts , the supreme court reasoned , should respect congress's decision by granting the agency the ability to interpret the statute congress has charged it with administering .
if the agency's , and by extension the administration's , permissible construction of a statute is undesirable , the electorate may have its voice heard through the democratic process .
moreover , the court noted that interpreting a statutory ambiguity is akin to making a policy decision on how to implement a statutory program .
in chevron , the court specifically acknowledged that "judges are not experts in the field," and thus "may not substitute [their] own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency. .
