because of insufficient funding , project maintenance has been consistently postponed , resulting in an extensive and costly list of deferred maintenance items .
the projects were constructed as part of the federal government's indian assimilation policy to foster agricultural opportunities and provide economic benefits to indian communities .
in this context , we were asked to examine ( 1 ) bia's estimated deferred maintenance cost for its 16 irrigation projects ; ( 2 ) what shortcomings , if any , exist in bia's current management of its irrigation projects ; and ( 3 ) any issues that need to be addressed to determine the long - term direction of bia's irrigation program .
the kinds of such deferred maintenance range from repairing or replacing dilapidated irrigation structures to clearing weeds from irrigation ditches .
there are over 100 irrigation works on indian reservations primarily across the western united states .
in addition to the deferred maintenance , water users have expressed concern that bia has been unresponsive in addressing the projects' ongoing operations and maintenance needs .
in addition , problems have been reported with collecting the fees that have been assessed .
the department of the interior's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) , which is responsible for providing social and economic services to indians , as well as managing land and natural resources held in trust by the united states for indians , currently refers to these irrigation works as either “irrigation projects” or “irrigation systems.” there are 16 irrigation projects where water users are charged for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation works by bia .
a number of prior reports on bia's irrigation projects have documented that the annual operations and maintenance fees have historically been set too low to cover the full cost of running the projects .
the 16 irrigation projects , which were generally initiated in the late 1800s and early 1900s by the department of the interior , include water storage facilities and delivery structures for agricultural purposes .
the remaining systems , on which bia does not charge an annual operation and maintenance fee , are operated and maintained through a collaborative effort which generally involves other bia programs , tribes , and water users .
management of these projects is decentralized , with local or regional bia offices responsible for project management .
in response to ongoing concerns about maintenance and management of the irrigation projects , in december 2003 senator conrad burns and congressman dennis rehberg , both of montana , sponsored a town hall meeting with local water users and bia officials to discuss problems at bia's irrigation projects .
the scarcity of water in the western part of the united states makes irrigation critical to the continued success of agricultural activities .
over time , non - indians began buying or leasing the land served by the projects for agricultural purposes , and project stakeholders evolved from indian water users and the tribes within the reservations to include non - indian water users as well .
fourteen projects are overseen by local bia agency superintendents , and the 2 largest projects are overseen directly by regional directors .
bia's management of some of its irrigation projects has serious shortcomings that undermine effective decisionmaking about project operations and maintenance .
