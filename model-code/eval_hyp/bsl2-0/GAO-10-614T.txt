this testimony , based on our report , discusses challenges fps continues to face in ( 1 ) managing its guard contractors , ( 2 ) overseeing guards deployed at federal facilities , and ( 3 ) actions fps has taken to address these challenges .
to accomplish its mission of protecting federal facilities , fps currently has a budget of about $1 billion , about 1,225 full - time employees , and about 15,000 contract security guards ( guards ) deployed at about 2,360 federal facilities across the country .
as you are aware , fps — within the national protection and programs directorate ( nppd ) of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — is responsible for protecting the buildings , grounds , and property that are under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) , as well as the persons on the property ; authorized to enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting gsa buildings and persons on the property ; and authorized to investigate offenses against these buildings and persons .
overall , we are also concerned about some of the steps fps plans to take to address our recommendations .
despite fps's recent actions , it continues to face challenges in ensuring that its $659 million guard program is effective in protecting federal facilities .
furthermore , while we support fps's overall plans to better manage its contract guard program , we believe it is also important for fps to have appropriate performance metrics to evaluate whether its planned actions are fully implemented and are effective in addressing the challenges it faces managing its contract guard program .
in fiscal year 2009 , fps obligated $659 million for guard services , which represents the single largest item in its budget .
guards do not have arrest authority but can detain individuals who are being disruptive or pose a danger to public safety .
first , without accurate and reliable data , fps cannot consistently ensure compliance with contract requirements and lacks information critical for effective oversight of its guard program .
dhs commented that written procedures already exist and are required for use by all dhs's office of procurement operations staff and the components it serves , including nppd .
these officials also said that the program may not be appropriate for all federal facilities .
guards are primarily responsible for controlling access to federal facilities by ( 1 ) checking the identification of government employees as well as members of the public who work in and visit federal facilities , and ( 2 ) operating security equipment , such as x - ray machines and magnetometers to screen for prohibited materials , such as firearms , knives , explosives , or items intended to be used to fabricate an explosive or incendiary device .
second , given that other federal agencies rely on many of the same contractors to provide security services , completing accurate evaluations of a contractor's past performance is critical to future contract awards .
dhs concurred with seven of our eight recommendations .
thus , in our report we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the under secretary of nppd and the director of fps to take the following eight actions: identify other approaches and options that would be most beneficial and financially feasible for protecting federal buildings ; rigorously and consistently monitor guard contractors' and guards' performance and step up enforcement against contractors that are not complying with the terms of the contract ; complete all contract performance evaluations in accordance with fps and federal acquisition regulation requirements ; issue a standardized record - keeping format to ensure that contract files have required documentation ; develop a mechanism to routinely monitor guards at federal facilities provide building - specific and scenario - based training and guidance to its develop and implement a management tool for ensuring that reliable , comprehensive data on the contract guard program are available on a real - time basis ; and verify the accuracy of all guard certification and training data before entering them into ramp , and periodically test the accuracy and reliability of ramp data to ensure that fps management has the information needed to effectively oversee its guard program .
