this legislation authorized va to provide certain health care benefits and other benefits ( including a monthly monetary allowance ) effective january 1 , 1997 .
va's veterans health administration ( vha ) administers the spina bifida health care program ( spina bifida program ) , which provides health care benefits to enrolled beneficiaries by processing and paying claims for covered services from private sector providers .
additional legislation expanded these benefits , and , as of october 10 , 2008 , health care benefits were no longer limited to health care services and supplies directly associated with the spina bifida condition .
accordingly , va has stated that comprehensive health care benefits are available to eligible veterans' children with spina bifida for services and supplies considered medically necessary and appropriate for all disabilities and diseases , not simply those related to spina bifida .
vha is the exclusive payer for health care services provided to spina bifida beneficiaries ; beneficiaries are not responsible for any copayments or deductibles .
this report examines for the spina bifida program ( 1 ) the extent to which vha conducts outreach about available benefits , ( 2 ) how vha processes claims , ( 3 ) what is known about claims that have been processed , and ( 4 ) what , if any , oversight , vha conducts of the claims process .
we also reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from vha about their outreach efforts , including outreach to inform enrolled beneficiaries and potentially eligible individuals about available health care benefits .
you raised questions as to whether eligible beneficiaries are receiving all the benefits to which they are entitled , and whether all eligible beneficiaries are aware of available benefits , and asked us to evaluate how vha provides health care benefits under the spina bifida program .
as of october 2013 , 1,228 beneficiaries were enrolled for coverage under the spina bifida program .
we interviewed representatives from vietnam veterans of america ( vva ) and the spina bifida association ( sba ) â€” the two key stakeholder organizations that have relationships with vietnam era veterans and individuals with spina bifida , respectively .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides health care benefits , as well as other benefits , to children diagnosed with spina bifida born to vietnam and certain other veterans .
subsequently , congress passed legislation , commonly known as the agent orange benefits act , to provide for the special needs of veterans' children born with spina bifida that possibly resulted from the exposure of one or both parents to herbicides during active service in vietnam .
we evaluated vha's outreach efforts within the context of federal internal control standards , as documented in gao's standards for internal control in the federal government .
specifically , we reviewed materials vha provides to enrolled beneficiaries , including vha's spina bifida program handbook .
va's veterans benefits administration ( vba ) determines eligibility for spina bifida benefits , including both health care and other benefits .
to improve awareness of the spina bifida program's health care benefits among potentially eligible individuals and to help them obtain the benefits to which they may be entitled , we recommend that the acting secretary of veterans affairs direct the acting under secretary for health to conduct outreach with key stakeholder groups regarding the program and its benefits .
