compared to the overall economy , the $1.4 trillion budget deficit equaled 9.9% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
the economy is expected to begin to recover in 2010 , but deficits are likely to remain high for some time both because of continued countercyclical fiscal policy and because reducing the deficit as soon as the economy begins to recover could have an undesired contractionary effect .
in an economic downturn , deficit reduction is usually not an immediate consideration .
cbo estimates that , in fy2009 , the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) resulted in additional outlays of $112 billion and a drop in revenues of $88 billion , which raised the budget deficit $200 billion above what it otherwise would have been .
in the longer run , however , continued deficits at current levels could ultimately reduce the long - run rate of economic growth .
but after four successive years of surpluses , outlays again exceeded revenues in 2002 and the budget has been in deficit since then .
the budget deficit in fy2009 was , in dollar terms , unprecedented .
in 1943 , the budget deficit reached 30.3% of gdp .
although both the severity of the current downturn and the size of the projected deficits surpass what most policymakers have experienced , experience remains a guide to policy .
cbo expects the deficit for fy2010 to be $1,349 billion .
economists are not necessarily changing their views about the economic effects of budget deficits even though those views may have been established in less trying times .
the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that the federal budget deficit for fy2009 was $1,414 billion , triple the $459 billion deficit recorded in fy2008 .
between 1992 and 1998 , a combination of budget policy and a booming economy entirely eliminated the deficit .
since 1946 and before now , the largest the budget deficit had been , relative to the overall economy , was 6% of gdp in 1983 .
as recently as fy2001 , the budget registered a surplus .
this report examines the economics the budget deficit .
the federal budget and the economy are closely interrelated .
the strength or weakness of the overall economy substantially affects the levels of outlays and receipts .
the budget also has significant effects on the economy , both in terms of how fast the economy grows , and also in terms of the overall allocation of resources .
perhaps the most obvious effect of the federal government budget surpluses of the 1990s was a decline in the amount of federal debt .
whether it is better to have a budget surplus or a deficit , the budget has clear - cut consequences for the economy .
as long as the federal debt grows faster than gdp , however , interest payments on that debt will constitute an ever - increasing share of total federal spending and of gdp .
the national saving rate rose after 1995 because increases in public saving more than offset falling private saving .
in recent history , budget surpluses have been rare , and a succession of surpluses rarer still .
even the large increases in debt contemplated for the next few years , while they may seem alarming , are not sufficient to cause significant economic instability as long as they are perceived to be temporary .
