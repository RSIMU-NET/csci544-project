agencies implement specific elements of laws through regulations .
congress and affected parties often request additional guidance to elaborate on implementation of a statute or regulation .
for this report , we reviewed how the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , labor ( dol ) , and selected subagencies or components at these four departments ( 1 ) use guidance and the processes and criteria they use to determine whether to issue guidance or undertake rulemaking ; ( 2 ) follow applicable criteria and leading practices in their policies , procedures , and practices for producing guidance ; and ( 3 ) ensure they follow dissemination requirements and facilitate end users' access to and comment on documents .
guidance and the concerns about its use , in 2007 the office of management and budget ( omb ) recognized the need for good guidance practices .
at the same time , concerns have been raised about the level of oversight for agencies' guidance , whether agencies seek feedback from affected parties on guidance , and how to ensure that agencies do not issue guidance when they should undertake rulemaking .
however , little is known about internal agency procedures for developing this guidance and the strategies agencies use to solicit public comment and feedback on these documents .
agencies also use guidance for circumstances they could not have anticipated when issuing a regulation and when additional clarifications are needed .
the scope of this review is limited to guidance issued to external parties and includes guidance explaining regulatory and grant - related requirements and other policies .
regulations are legally binding and typically require a desired action or prohibit certain actions by regulated parties .
the number of guidance documents related to regulations issued by agencies has often been reported to outnumber the agency regulations that these documents can help explain .
agencies rely on guidance documents — which are not legally binding — to clarify statutes or regulatory text and to inform the public about complex policy implementation topics .
similarly , our past work has recommended that agencies issue guidance to clarify policies when we found confusion among grantees or others about a component's policy or practices .
one of the main purposes of guidance is to explain and help regulated parties comply with agency regulations .
as shown in figure 1 , agencies use guidance documents to explain how they plan to interpret regulations .
in particular , omb established review processes for the documents with the most broad and substantial impact .
we reviewed guidance processes at the 4 departments and 25 of their selected subagencies , or components , that ( 1 ) were within the requesting committee's jurisdiction and ( 2 ) engaged in regulatory or grantmaking activities .
guidance documents , sometimes referred to as sub - regulatory guidance , set forth policy on or interpret statutory , regulatory , or technical issues and come in a variety of formats and names .
guidance documents are not legally binding and are often used by agencies to explain how they plan to interpret a regulation or provide additional clarifications .
we also spoke with food and drug administration ( fda ) officials to gain a better understanding of their related statutory requirements for guidance .
