unless vba takes more aggressive action to effectively address its serious management and technical weaknesses , its modernization efforts will not succeed .
these are: creating a credible business strategy and supporting information resources developing a much improved investment strategy for selecting and managing its portfolio of information technology projects in a more disciplined , businesslike manner ; and strengthening its technical capability to develop software applications that will be critical to supporting efforts to improve service to veterans and control costs .
while it is clear that dedicated employees at vba who care about veterans and service delivery are working to overcome these difficulties , major , sustained improvements in critical service delivery and operating performance have eluded vba .
successfully meeting this challenge is key to improving critical services to almost 27 million veterans and their dependents and lowering vba's operating costs .
vba is , however , experiencing many of the classic , fundamental management and technical problems that have prevented federal agencies from realizing the benefits expected from substantial investments in information technology .
i am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the veterans benefits administration's ( vba ) efforts to modernize its operations by streamlining its business processes and taking greater advantage of information technology .
my testimony today will focus on what vba needs to do in three major areas to increase the likelihood of success .
the business and operational problems facing vba are complex and not easy to resolve .
vba has begun to take action to improve agency operations and service delivery , but it has not yet implemented enough of the right kinds of actions â€” actions that involve developing a sound business strategy and the supporting plans , approaches , and measures to guide them into the next century .
however , systems - development initiatives in support of major new projects , such as the replacement of the payment system , should be reassessed for the risk of potential delays , cost overruns , and shortfalls in anticipated system functions and features .
the need for more rigorous management and technical methods is critical if vba is to successfully develop modern , efficient , and cost - effective business processes and computer systems that will allow them to deliver truly improved services to veterans .
vba instituted several conventional stopgap measures to deal with this backlog .
we are pleased to see that vba is already initiating positive actions relating to our other recommendations , including acquiring expert advice to assist it in improving its ability to develop high - quality software , consistent with criteria set forth by the software engineering institute .
to deal with these issues , as well as cope with today's constrained budgetary climate , the agency is undertaking a number of major initiatives , including beginning a business process reengineering effort for its compensation and pension programs , restructuring its regional office responsibilities , and consolidating its data centers .
vba's investment in modernization activities has yielded some improvement in hardware and software applications .
we agree that the software conversion and development activities required to address issues such as the year 2000 must continue ; we would , in fact , characterize these as sustaining critical day - to - day operations .
