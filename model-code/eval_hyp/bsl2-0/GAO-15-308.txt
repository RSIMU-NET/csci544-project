in this report , we evaluated program progress towards ( 1 ) achieving cost and performance goals ; ( 2 ) meeting schedule targets ; and ( 3 ) obtaining critical manufacturing knowledge prior to the low - rate production decision .
to assess progress toward achieving cost goals in the calendar year of this review ( 2014 ) , we analyzed briefings by program and contractor officials ; financial management documents ; program budgets ; defense acquisition executive summary reports ; and selected acquisition reports .
in our three previous reports , we made recommendations to the department of defense ( dod ) to improve the program , and dod has addressed some of them .
to measure progress toward achieving performance goals , we reviewed current estimates of key performance parameters , key system attributes , and technical performance metrics and compared them to threshold and objective requirements .
the kc - 135 , currently the mainstay of the u.s. tanker force , is now over 50 years old on average and costs increasingly more to maintain and support , with additional concerns that age - related problems could potentially ground the fleet .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 requires that this we annually review and report on the kc - 46 program through 2017.is our fourth report reviewing the program .
the air force plans to develop , test , and field 18 kc - 46 tankers by august 2017 , and eventually field a total of 179 aircraft .
we also discussed changes in cost and performance data with the kc - 46 program office , other defense offices , and the prime contractor , the boeing company ( boeing ) .
appendix i lists each of the reports , our recommendations , and what dod has done or is planning to do to address these recommendations .
kc - 46 aircraft are expected to replace almost forty percent of the air force's aging aerial refueling tanker fleet , including the kc - 135 stratotanker .
we also compared program milestones established when the program began to current estimates and reviewed defense contract management agency monthly assessments of kc - 46 schedule health and program office schedule analyses .
these challenges could result in additional schedule delays .
to assess progress toward meeting schedule targets , we analyzed test , software , and manufacturing plans and metrics .
we discussed schedule related issues with the air force's kc - 46 program office , other defense offices , and boeing .
aerial refueling — the transfer of fuel from airborne tankers to combat and airlift forces — allows u.s. military aircraft to fly farther , stay airborne longer , and transport more weapons , equipment , and supplies , and is critical to the u.s. military's ability to project power overseas and to effectively operate within a combat theater .
we visited boeing's commercial production line and its facilities for system integration and military modifications , and obtained information on the program's testing , software , and manufacturing plans and progress .
it recently completed its fourth year of a planned seven - year development program to convert an aircraft designed for commercial use into an aerial refueling tanker .
the kc - 46 tanker modernization program , valued at $49 billion , is among the air force's highest acquisition priorities and is intended to provide aerial refueling to air force , navy , marine corps , and allied aircraft .
