that assurance is dependent on the control system operating as designed , including the production of certain information that management determined was needed for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the control system and making changes as appropriate .
as described in the postal service's manuals , the control system requires that presort and barcode mail verifications , including supervisory reviews , be done and documented ; mailings resubmitted following a failed verification be reverified to ensure that the errors are corrected ; and the results of verifications , including supervisory reviews , be regularly reported to specific management levels , including postal service headquarters .
as agreed with the subcommittee , we evaluated the current system of controls for such mailings to assess whether those controls reasonably ensure that mailer - claimed discounts are granted only when earned .
the postal service recognizes the need to have reasonable assurance that its bulk business mail operation adequately protects the service from postage revenue losses .
toward that end , in 1989 and 1990 , the postal service established a control system designed to give it such assurance .
in fiscal year 1994 , according to postal service data , almost one - half of the service's total mail revenue of $47.7 billion was from bulk business mail .
this cost is in the form of higher processing expenses because the postal service must then do work it has already , in effect , paid mailers to do through discounted postage rates .
this report responds to your request that we review the postal service's controls over postage paid on presorted / barcoded mailings submitted by business customers .
to guard against accepting improperly prepared mailings , postal service bulk mail acceptance clerks are supposed to verify the accuracy of bulk business mailings .
when mail with preparation errors is accepted into the mailstream at a presort and / or barcode discount rate , the postal service incurs a cost .
sometimes , the mailing does not qualify for the postage discount claimed .
mailers compute the postage they owe on each bulk business mailing .
it is inevitable that some revenue losses will occur in a program of this magnitude , and , as with any business enterprise , the risk of revenue losses must be weighed against the cost of establishing controls to prevent and detect such losses .
the postal service , however , is hindered in its ability to make data - driven decisions about the adequacy of bulk mail acceptance controls .
those guidelines contained specific procedures and approaches for bulk mail acceptance and provided guidance to supervisors and managers for more analytical and effective management of acceptance employees .
we did not attempt to estimate the extent to which revenue losses have occurred .
for example , the service does not know the full extent of losses resulting from mailer preparation errors , and , furthermore , it has not sought to develop a means for identifying such losses .
however , we believe that sufficient evidence exists for the postal service to be concerned that substantial revenue losses may have occurred and gone undetected in the bulk business mail program .
available documentation shows that during fiscal year 1994 , the bulk business mail control system identified mailer preparation errors totaling $168 million .
