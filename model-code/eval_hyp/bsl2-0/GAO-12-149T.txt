the four major categories of epa spending in fiscal year 2010 were: operating budget ( $3.9 billion ) for basic regulatory , research , and enforcement activities ; infrastructure grants ( $3.9 billion ) providing financial assistance to states , municipalities , interstate commissions , and tribal governments to fund a variety of drinking water , wastewater , air , and other environmental projects ; trust funds ( $1.4 billion ) from appropriations to pay for , among other things , superfund and leaking underground storage tank hazardous waste cleanup when responsible parties are not available to pay ; and categorical grants ( $1.1 billion ) to states , tribes , nonprofit organizations , and others for specific environmental programs , including air and radiation , water , drinking water , hazardous waste , and pesticides and toxic chemicals .
from fiscal years 2000 through 2010 , the agency's budget rose in nominal terms from $7.8 billion to $10.4 billion , but has remained relatively flat over this period in real terms .
i will focus my remarks today on several key management and budget issues at epa , including ( 1 ) management of epa's workload , workforce , and real property ; ( 2 ) coordination with other agencies to more effectively leverage limited resources ; and ( 3 ) observations on the agency's budget justifications .
epa has generally agreed with our recommendations .
many of our prior reports have included recommendations intended to improve the management of epa's programs .
these challenges are particularly important as congress and the administration seek to decrease the cost of government while improving its performance and accountability .
structurally , epa comprises headquarters offices largely aligned with its primary authorizing statutes and 10 regional offices that help implement these statutes .
my testimony today draws on our recent work , including our march 2011 testimony on epa's major management challenges,and observations from our periodic reviews of epa's budget justification .
epa operates in a highly complex and controversial regulatory arena , and its policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy , society , and government .
epa conducts its work under an array of environmental laws , including the clean air and clean water acts .
thus , a substantial portion of the agency's budget consists of grants to state , local , tribal , and other partners .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss management challenges and budget considerations at the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
the objective of our budget justification reviews is to provide pertinent and timely information that congress can use during budget deliberations by raising questions about specific programs in the president's proposed budget .
epa relies on other federal and state agencies to help implement its programs .
over the years , we have observed that epa has made progress in its efforts to recover unliquidated funds from expired contracts , grants , and interagency agreements .
use of recertified funds can offset some need for new funding .
given the federal deficit and the government's long - term fiscal challenges , it is important that epa improve coordination with its federal and state partners to reduce administrative burdens , redundant activities , and inefficient uses of federal resources .
