specifically , we were asked to study ( 1 ) the factors leading to the mergers among the largest public accounting firms in the 1980s and 1990s ; ( 2 ) the impact of consolidation on competition , including the availability of auditor choices for large national and multinational public companies ; ( 3 ) the impact of consolidation on the cost , quality , and independence of audit services ; ( 4 ) the impact of consolidation on capital formation and securities markets ; and ( 5 ) the barriers to entry faced by smaller firms in competing with the largest firms for large national and multinational public company clients .
to evaluate the factors contributing to consolidation among the largest firms , we interviewed current and former partners of large public accounting firms involved in past mergers and department of justice ( doj ) and federal trade commission ( ftc ) officials .
as a result , congress mandated in the sarbanes - oxley act of 2002 that we study these issues .
big 8 mergers and andersen's sudden dissolution have prompted heightened concerns about concentration among the largest accounting firms and the potential effect on competition and various other factors .
these four firms currently audit over 78 percent of all u.s. public companies and 99 percent of public company annual sales .
however , we did not review any antitrust analyses conducted by doj specific to the proposed mergers of the 1980s and 1990s .
internationally , the big 4 dominate the market for audit services .
the number of firms widely considered capable of providing audit services to large national and multinational companies decreased from eight ( “the big 8” ) in the 1980s to four ( “the big 4” ) today .
the big 4 firms are substantially larger than the other u.s. or international accounting firms , each with thousands of partners , tens of thousands of employees , offices located around the world , and annual revenues in the billions of dollars .
the reduction was the result of mergers involving six of the top eight firms since the late 1980s and the abrupt dissolution of arthur andersen llp ( andersen ) in 2002 .
however , a small number of very large firms have traditionally provided audit and attest services for the majority of public companies , particularly large national and multinational companies .
there are hundreds of public accounting firms that audit public companies in the united states .
we also collected information from and coordinated with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) and its counterparts from the other six members ( canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united kingdom ) of the group of seven nations as required in the mandate .
while gao's statute provides us with access to predecisional information absent a certification by the president or the director of the office of management and budget , we were more interested in the reasons for the mergers than doj's analysis in approving the mergers .
according to doj officials , most of the firm documents had been returned to the relevant parties , and other documents were viewed as “predecisional” by doj .
