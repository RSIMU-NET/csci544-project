first , i will address the problems we are having in obtaining access to department of defense ( dod ) information that we need regarding these competitions to meet our reporting responsibilities under the 1998 defense authorization act .
in relation to those responsibilities , i will also discuss the recent competition for c - 5 aircraft workload and our assessment of it ; the adequacy of dod's support for its determination that competing combined , rather than individual workloads of each maintenance depot is more logical and economical ; and concerns participants have raised about the upcoming competitions for the workloads at the air logistics centers in sacramento , california , and san antonio , texas .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to the public - private competitions for workloads at two maintenance depots identified for closure during the 1995 base realignment and closure process .
before i discuss specifics , i will summarize the key points in my testimony .
privatization - in - place was one initiative for retaining these employment goals .
during 1997 , congress continued to oversee dod's strategy for allocating workloads currently performed at the closing depots .
for example , total estimated direct and indirect cost and savings to dod must be considered in any evaluation .
further , we discussed competition issues with potential public and private sector participants .
dod issued these reports on february 3 , 1998 .
to mitigate the impact of the closures on the local communities and center employees , in 1995 the administration announced its decision to maintain certain employment levels at these locations .
the 1998 defense authorization act required that we and dod analyze various issues related to the competitions at the closing depots and report to congress concerning several areas .
first , within 60 days of its enactment , the defense authorization act requires us to review the c - 5 aircraft workload competition and subsequent award to the warner robins air logistics center and report to congress on whether ( 1 ) the procedures used provided an equal opportunity for offerors without regard to performance location ; ( 2 ) procedures are in compliance with applicable law and the far ; and ( 3 ) award results in the lowest total cost to dod .
mr. chairman , we are working diligently to meet the committee's mandates and to safeguard sensitive air force information that is necessary to accomplish this work .
as previously stated , the act also requires that we review the solicitations and the competitions to determine if dod has complied with the act and applicable law .
the air force cannot issue final solicitations until at least 30 days after these reports are submitted and all other requirements of the act are completed .
our lack of access to information is seriously impairing our ability to carry out our reporting responsibilities under this act .
since that decision , congress and the administration have debated the process and procedures for deciding where and by whom the workloads at the closing depots should be performed .
central to this debate are concerns about the excess facility capacity at the air force's three remaining maintenance depots and the legislative requirement â€” 10 u.s.c .
