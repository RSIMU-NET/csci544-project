each week the social security administration ( ssa ) pays over $1 billion in cash payments to people with disabilities on di and ssi .
you asked us to discuss today ways to improve the disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs by helping people with disabilities return to work .
while providing a measure of income security , these payments for the most part do little to enhance the work capacities and promote the economic independence of these di and ssi recipients .
yet societal attitudes have shifted toward goals , as embodied in the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) , of economic self - sufficiency and the right of people with disabilities to full participation in society .
moreover , medical advances and new technologies provide more opportunities than ever for people with disabilities to work .
our april 1996 report shows , in fact , that program design and implementation weaknesses hinder maximizing beneficiary work potential .
today , however , a growing number of private companies have been focusing on enabling people with disabilities to return to work .
other work we are doing for you highlights strategies from the private sector and other countries that ssa could use to develop administrative and legislative solutions to improve return - to - work outcomes .
not surprisingly , these weaknesses also yield poor return - to - work outcomes .
and ssa does little to provide the support and assistance that many people with disabilities need to work .
indeed , if an additional 1 percent of the 6.3 million working - age ssi and di beneficiaries were to leave ssa's disability rolls by returning to work , lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $2.9 billion .
the application process places a heavy emphasis on work incapacity , and it presumes that medical impairments preclude employment .
to develop this information , we surveyed people in the private sector generally recognized as leaders in developing disability management programs that focus on return - to - work efforts .
outcomes .
we found that the di and ssi programs are out of sync with these trends .
we also interviewed officials in germany and sweden because the experiences of their social insurance programs show that return - to - work strategies are applicable to a broad and diverse population with a wide range of work histories , job skills , and disabilities .
we also conducted focus groups with people receiving disability benefits and convened a panel of disability experts .
at one time , the common business practice was to encourage someone with a disability to leave the workforce .
federal ssi benefits paid to ssi beneficiaries with disabilities in 1994 equaled $18.9 billion .
while di and ssi return - to - work outcomes have been poor , many technological and medical advances have created more opportunities for some individuals with disabilities to engage in work .
by 1994 , 31 percent of di beneficiaries and 57 percent of ssi working - age beneficiaries had mental impairments — conditions that have one of the longest anticipated entitlement periods ( about 16 years for di ) .
advances in the management of disability — like medication to control mental illness or computer - aided prosthetic devices — have helped reduce the functional limitations associated with some disabilities .
