as you requested , we reviewed the current contract between the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the california institute of technology ( caltech ) for the operation of the jpl and analyzed whether modifications made to it and other management changes adequately address the concerns raised in our previous reports .
this is our third and final report on selected contract provisions and internal controls at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) .
similarly , although the scope of work was not substantively modified for nasa tasks , it was narrowed and oversight was increased for non - nasa work performed by jpl .
jpl work is primarily funded by nasa ; however , other sponsors can fund jpl efforts under reimbursable arrangements with nasa .
finally , the total number of deviations from the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) in the contract was reduced .
also , new reporting and review procedures could provide control over selected costs comparable to that at commercial contractors .
changes have been made to address the concerns raised in our july 1993 report .
also , changes in jpl's policies on charging nasa for food and beverages have substantially reduced those costs .
eight areas have been identified for 1995 — including cost containment , improved compliance with jpl policies , increased cultural and gender diversity in senior management , and effective social and educational outreach programs consistent with overall nasa and federal government initiatives in these areas .
it provides a framework of procedures , regulations , and other guidance for funding specific tasks .
ffrdcs are operated under agreements funded by sponsoring federal agencies to provide for research or development needs that cannot readily be met by the agencies or contractors .
jpl's total 1994 business base was just over $1 billion .
together , these overlapping roles contribute to unique jpl management and oversight challenges .
according to nasa , these new reporting requirements improve the visibility of such costs .
nasa and jpl responded quickly to our concerns and recommendations to rectify internal control weaknesses in the management of nasa equipment .
policies and procedures for employee equipment loans and the tracking of equipment at caltech have been improved .
first , the fixed fee under nasa's previous contract with caltech was replaced with a fee structure that bases two - thirds of the fee award on nasa's assessment of jpl's performance .
jpl is nasa's only federally funded research and development center ( ffrdc ) and is operated under contract by caltech .
dcaa also believes the current contract language and the new reporting requirements could improve nasa's control of these costs .
jpl receives work projects directly from nasa program offices .
rather than signing separate contracts for individual work projects , funding for jpl is provided under “task orders” for specific work .
in addition , our concern regarding the tuition asistance benefit will be addressed as part of nasa's recent request to dcaa for a review of jpl's compensation package .
beginning last year , that office increased its oversight of the appropriateness of non - nasa task orders , particularly for those involving computer purchases .
it can also submit proposals to , or respond to non - competitive requests from , other work sponsors using up to 25 percent of the jpl direct workforce .
