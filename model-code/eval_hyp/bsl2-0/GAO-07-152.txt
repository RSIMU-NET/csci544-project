in the past 20 years , epa and states have spent over $10 billion in public funds to clean up these releases .
despite these efforts , as of september 30 , 2005 , over 100,000 releases had not yet been fully cleaned up .
in 1984 , the congress amended the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) to require epa to develop release detection , prevention , and cleanup regulations that apply to owners and operators of underground storage tanks .
epa's primary role has been to provide national guidance , assistance , and leadership to aid the states in implementing their programs .
for the purposes of this report we defined public funding as including any funding controlled and / or provided by state and federal agencies , such as funds from the federal lust trust fund , state financial assurance funds , and other funds appropriated by states to pay for cleanup that would not otherwise occur .
according to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , about 450,000 releases from underground storage tanks had been confirmed in the 50 states and the district of columbia between 1985 and september 30 , 2005 â€” the most recent year for which comprehensive data were available .
in this context , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) states' estimates of the cost in public funding from state and federal sources to clean up known releases from underground storage tanks , ( 2 ) states' primary sources of funding for addressing these releases and the sources' future viability , and ( 3 ) the funding available from federal sources to address these releases .
individuals coming into contact with this contamination , which can contain known carcinogens , could experience health problems ranging from nausea to kidney or liver damage .
epa also maintains responsibility for taking enforcement actions in new york because the state lacks the necessary laws .
epa's ust program is primarily implemented by the states ; epa maintains responsibility for program implementation on lands owned by indian tribes and in idaho because that state does not have the necessary laws in place .
through the survey , we gathered state officials' estimates as of september 30 , 2005 , of the current number of known releases that have not yet been cleaned up , the number of releases that will require public funding to clean up , and the amount of public funding these cleanups will require .
the congress annually appropriates amounts from the lust trust fund to epa , which in turn distributes the majority of the funds to help states that have entered into cooperative agreements with the agency to implement their cleanup programs .
in response , epa began developing the underground storage tank ( ust ) program in 1985 to prevent releases of petroleum and hazardous substances into the environment , detect releases when they occur , and clean up any contamination from a release .
we also relied on our survey to gather information about state sources of funding used to address releases , the status of these sources , and their future viability .
to obtain estimates of the cost to the public to clean up known releases , we surveyed state officials responsible for underground storage tank programs or , where applicable , managers of state cleanup funds , in the 50 states and the district of columbia .
