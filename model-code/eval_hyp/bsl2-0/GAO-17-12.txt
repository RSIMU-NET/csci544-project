legislation enacted over the past 10 years , such as the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) interoperable communications act of 2015 , highlighted the critical importance of effective , interoperable communication systems for federal agencies with law - enforcement and emergency - response missions .
for example , the post - katrina emergency management reform act established the emergency communications preparedness center ( ecpc ) to improve coordination and information sharing among federal emergency communications programs in support of interoperability and continued communications during disasters and incidents .
in this report , we examine: ( 1 ) lmr systems and devices used by selected federal agencies and the state of lmr interoperability among these agencies ; ( 2 ) factors that help and hinder interoperability among agencies that use lmr ; and ( 3 ) selected agencies' practices for procuring lmr systems .
however , there is no single operational authority for emergency response among federal departments and questions remain regarding the ability of federal agencies to achieve interoperable lmr communications .
amid continuing questions about lmr interoperability among federal agencies and in light of advancements in lmr technology , we were asked to examine aspects of this interoperability as well as lmr procurement practices .
according to dhs , advancements in lmr technology — including further development of standards - based equipment and multi - band radios capable of operating on several different channels across multiple radio bands — may help address some interoperability challenges .
we interviewed officials from federal agencies with responsibilities related to emergency communications and procurement of lmr equipment , including dhs ; the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) and the national institute of standards and technology within the department of commerce ; the federal communications commission ( fcc ) ; the general services administration ( gsa ) ; the office of management and budget ( omb ) ; and administrators of the ecpc .
although lmr systems have similar components — including handheld portable radios and mobile radios mounted in vehicles , as well as base stations to transmit signals or audio — interoperable lmr communications remains a challenge for various technical and non - technical reasons .
we screened an initial set of 74 agencies to determine which agencies use lmr technologies to communicate with at least one other federal agency for daily operations , planned events , such as presidential inaugurations , or emergency incidents .
whether conducting daily operations , overseeing planned events , or responding to emergencies , many federal agencies use land mobile radio ( lmr ) systems to gather and communicate information across multiple disciplines and jurisdictions and to coordinate response efforts with other federal agencies .
agencies that met this criterion — 58 federal lmr users in all — were further surveyed about the types of equipment they use , interoperability needs , and procurement practices , among other topics .
we also reviewed relevant statutes and dhs planning documents related to interoperability among federal agencies , including the national emergency communications plan , the national response framework , and the safecom interoperability continuum documentation related to key elements of interoperability .
all 74 agencies responded to our screening question .
to address these objectives , we conducted a web - based survey of civilian federal agencies , identified through their membership in the ecpc .
