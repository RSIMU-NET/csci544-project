by contrast , hmo enrollment in most rural areas , and even in some metropolitan markets , is negligible .
for each of 3,141 counties in 1995 , the latest data available at the time of our review , these data showed ( 1 ) the number of eligible medicare beneficiaries , ( 2 ) the number enrolled in managed care plans with medicare risk contracts , and ( 3 ) the per enrollee amount that medicare paid plans ( that is , the adjusted average per capita cost ( aapcc ) rate for the county ) .
to identify where beneficiaries were enrolled in hmos and the rates that medicare paid to hmos , we used data obtained from the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) office of managed care .
although such large disparities are sometimes attributed to areas' medicare payment rates for hmos , studies have identified this as only one of several influences at work .
in some metropolitan areas like portland , oregon , and tucson , arizona , the dominant form of medicare managed care — the health maintenance organization ( hmo ) — has enrolled more than 40 percent of the medicare beneficiaries .
enrollment nationwide in the medicare managed care program has more than tripled in the last decade — growing from about 1 million enrollees in 1987 to about 3.8 million in 1996 — but differences in enrollment by state and by market area are striking .
to explore this issue further , you asked us to identify patterns in hmo enrollment and medicare payment rates , and examine selected geographical areas — in particular , some with higher enrollment / lower payment rates and some with lower enrollment / higher payment rates — and describe how the presence or absence of certain factors could affect enrollment .
in a recent report prepared at your request , we identified a number of areas where medicare hmo enrollment was higher despite lower payment rates and others where higher payments had failed to generate enrollment .
we focused our work primarily on counties in three of the categories: lower enrollment / lower payment , lower enrollment / higher payment , and higher enrollment / lower payment .
we categorized county enrollment as lower , intermediate , or higher , and in a similar manner categorized counties by payment rates .
to identify factors that are likely to affect risk hmo enrollment , we interviewed officials at hmo plans in three markets that had different patterns of aapcc payments and risk hmo enrollment — boston , detroit , and portland .
we then placed each county in one of nine categories based on its combination of risk hmo enrollment and payment rate .
to obtain more information on factors related to enrollment , we interviewed officials at hcfa's regional offices , six national hmo chains , four additional regional hmos , five management consulting firms , and five employers .
facing neither profit nor loss from serving medicare beneficiaries , cost contract hmos lacked a strong incentive to reduce unnecessary care and deliver care efficiently .
under medicare's initial authority for paying hmos that provided care to beneficiaries , few hmos contracted with medicare .
legislation changed medicare's payment mechanism in 1982 .
