clearly , effective management of information technology and resources could help address these challenges .
however , there are multiple challenges to effectively using these technologies to manage wildland fires , including challenges with data , systems , infrastructure , staffing , and the effective use of new products .
however , progress on these initiatives has been slow .
in our final report , due to be issued next month , we will further discuss geospatial information technologies , challenges to effectively using these technologies , and opportunities to improve the effective use of geospatial information technologies .
we will also make recommendations to address these challenges and to improve the use of geospatial technologies in wildland fire management .
we will also discuss key challenges to effectively using these technologies .
key challenges include issues with geospatial data , systems , infrastructure , staffing , and the use of new products .
the national wildfire coordinating group — comprising representatives from the five land management agencies and from other federal , state , and tribal organizations — has several initiatives planned or under way to address challenges to effectively using geospatial technologies and to improve the interagency management of information resources .
clearly , effective interagency management of information resources and technology could help address the challenges faced by the wildland fire community in using geospatial information technologies .
in our report , due to be issued in september 2003 , we further discuss the use of geospatial technologies in support of wildland fire management , challenges to effectively using these technologies , and opportunities to address key challenges and to improve the effective use of geospatial technologies .
this information can be used to help reduce the risk that a fire will become uncontrollable , to respond to critical events while a fire is burning , and to aid in recovering from fire disasters .
however , there are multiple challenges to effectively using geospatial technologies — all complicated by the fact that wildland fire management extends beyond a single agency's responsibility and requires a collaborative interagency approach .

at your request , we will provide an overview of key geospatial information technologies and their uses in different phases of wildland fire management .
congressman hefley and congressman udall: we appreciate the opportunity to join in today's forum to discuss our ongoing work on geospatial information technologies that can be used to aid in wildland fire management .
we will also make recommendations to improve the use of geospatial technologies in support of wildland fire management .
this statement provides an interim update on key segments of our ongoing review of the use of geospatial information technologies in wildland fire management .
geospatial information technologies — sensors , systems , and software that collect , manage , manipulate , analyze , model , and display information about locations on the earth's surface — can aid in managing wildland fires by providing accurate , detailed , and timely information to federal , state , and local decision makers , fire - fighting personnel , and the public .
however , progress on these initiatives has been slow .
