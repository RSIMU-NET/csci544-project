to structure the ways in which agencies issue regulations pursuant to their delegated authority , congress has created a statutory scheme of procedural controls .
using that delegated authority , agencies issue regulations to implement those statutes and set the details of public policy .
congress designed these basic stepsâwhich create the backbone of the federal rulemaking processâto allow for public input into federal agencies' policymaking decisions .
under the constitutional separation of powers system , congress enacts statutes th at often delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies .
the most significant of these controls is the administrative procedure act ( apa ) of 1946 , which generally requires agencies to issue a proposed rule and take public comment prior to issuing a final rule .
congress viewed hearing from such parties as a normal part of the legislative process , and therefore applicable to rulemaking. .
as one scholar noted , "one of the apa's objectives was to open rulemaking to public participation , especially by those whose interests might be adversely affected by an agency's actions .
federal rulemaking is one of the crucial methods through which public policy is established and implemented in the united states .
the apa's notice and comment requirements are possibly the best known and most significant mechanism allowing for public input into the rulemaking process .
thus , the apa petition mechanism is a potentially efficient ( and arguably underused ) means for an individual or stakeholder to call on an agency to take a particular action .
a lesser known procedural control that congress created in the apa is a petition mechanism through which any interested party can request an agency to issue , amend , or repeal a rule .
this report briefly discusses the origin of the apa petition mechanism , outlines the mechanism's requirements for agencies , provides information from various outside sources about what may make an effective petition , discusses potential benefits to agencies and the public , and , finally , identifies some examples of statutory petition mechanisms that congress created in addition to the apa's .
an agency is not necessarily required to grant the petition or take the requested action , but the apa does require the agency to respond and to do so in a "reasonable time. .
rulemaking petitions have several potential benefits , such as that they can provide additional , low - cost opportunities for public participation in federal rulemaking .
in 2013 , the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) published a proposed rule to amend its procedures for receiving and considering petitions .
such allocation of resources could cause delays in other activities at an agency , such as issuing other regulations .
nonetheless , considering and responding to rulemaking petitions can be time - and resource - intensive for agencies .
however , as discussed in the last subsection below , responding to rulemaking petitions could potentially require agencies to allocate resources they would otherwise use elsewhere .
notably , however , agencies have a great deal of discretion in determining the specifics of their procedures for receiving , considering , and responding to petitions .
those requirements are discussed below .
for example , some of the suggestions provided by the center for effective government above are from the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) regulations and guidance , which are on its website .
