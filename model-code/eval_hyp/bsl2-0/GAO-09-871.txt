for example , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) and the federal transit administration ( fta ) started collaborating in 2005 by funding research on expanding housing near transit .
for example , hud provides rental housing assistance through three major programs — housing choice vouchers , public housing , and project - based rental assistance ; in fiscal year 2008 , these programs provided rental assistance to about 4.75 million households and , according to hud officials , paid about $31.25 billion in rental subsidies .
however , under the current structure , the federal government provides significant funding to state and local governments to support both local affordable housing and surface transportation programs through separate housing and transportation departments .
the federal government has acknowledged the link between housing and transportation .
such costs can particularly affect lower - income households , since these households are more transit dependent and have fewer transportation choices available .
some policy makers and housing experts , however , have raised concerns that lower - income households might not benefit from these developments .
also , housing stakeholders have expressed concern that existing affordable housing — whether subsidized or not — presently located near transit may no longer be financially feasible once a transit - oriented development is built , thereby increasing the demand for affordable housing .
dot , through a variety of fta programs to include the new starts program , has provided more than $33 billion over the last decade to help design , construct , rehabilitate , and modernize fixed - guideway transit projects throughout the country .
in 2008 , the appropriations committees directed hud and fta to jointly address new and better ways for promoting affordable housing near transit service .
specifically , they are concerned that the high demand for housing at transit - oriented developments will encourage developers , who typically seek to maximize the return on their housing investments , to primarily build market rate housing that may limit affordable housing opportunities for lower - income households .
congress , among others , has raised questions about how these departments could better work together .
the perceived benefits of transit - oriented developments include reducing individual households' transportation costs by providing residents with walkable access to transit service and shopping , and reducing the investment needed for local governments to build and maintain roads .
officials in cities such as denver and seattle believe that promoting transit - oriented development will realize these benefits and can spur economic development .
in addition , there has been an increased focus on combining the cost of housing and transportation as the “true” cost of housing affordability .
to combat increasing costs for both individual households and local governments , numerous local communities believe there is a need to expand housing opportunities and other amenities located near transit by promoting transit - oriented developments .
transit - oriented developments are commonly seen as compact , mixed - use ( commercial and residential ) , walkable neighborhoods located near transit facilities — such as fixed - guideway stations .
in addition , state and local governments , which build , operate , and maintain each region's transportation system , may need to accommodate more people driving longer distances to work , and with an increase in traffic congestion , will likely need to spend more money on roads .
