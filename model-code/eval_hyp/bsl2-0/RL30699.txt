in particular , the bush administration has singled out state sponsors of terrorism with nbc weapons programs as particular security threats .
accordingly , congress has been concerned about the countries and groups that have nuclear , biological and chemical ( nbc ) weapons , are developing or trying to acquire them , and about those who have or seek missile delivery systems .
the unpredictability of terrorist efforts to acquire nbc weapons and a potentially higher probability of use pose a serious challenge to global stability and security .
others emphasize the negative impact of the nuclear tests by india , pakistan and north korea ; missile tests by north korea , iran , india , and pakistan ; continuing transfers of dangerous technology by states such as china , russia , and north korea ; the activities of clandestine procurement networks ; and a growing interest in nbc weapons among terrorists .
u.s. and allied leaders and analysts continue to debate the exact nature and extent of the wmd threat .
some u.s. and foreign analysts emphasize the positive impact of the demise of the soviet union and progress made in u.s. - russian arms control and international arms control .
the status of nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons worldwide has changed only slowly over time .
the heightened sense of vulnerability to terrorism since the attacks in september 2001 , coupled with reports of al qaeda pursuing research on chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear weapons , has focused attention on the connection between terrorism and wmd .
around the same time , u.n. inspections uncovered iraq's massive nbc weapons programs and a crisis erupted over the north korean nuclear weapons program .
the dissolution of the soviet union had turned some russian weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) strengths into weaknesses and the fear of "loose nukes"prompted the u.s. government to help shore up the safety and security of russian wmd infrastructure .
in march 2002 , president bush stated that "... every nation in our coalition must take seriously the growing threat of terror on a catastrophic scale â€” terror armed with biological , chemical , or nuclear weapons. .
this report focuses on the current threat and trends in nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons and missiles .
a "paradox of the new strategic environment," according to then - secretary of defense william cohen , was that "american [conventional] military superiority actually increases the threat of nuclear , biological and chemical attack against us by creating incentives for adversaries to challenge us asymmetrically. .
it could no longer be assumed that the united states would face symmetric or parallel threats .
in absolute numbers , stockpiles are actually decreasing .
in the mid - 1990s , the primary threat posed by nbc weapons to the united states shifted from an all - out u.s. - russian strategic exchange to less overwhelming , but more numerous and perhaps less predictable threats .
strengthened nonproliferation includes active diplomacy , multilateral regimes , threat reduction assistance , nuclear material and export controls , and nonproliferation sanctions .
these variables would have a significant impact on threat assessments of wmd capability .
