although leases are no longer issued under dwrra , further royalty relief is currently available under other legislation and programs , raising the prospect that the federal government may be forgoing additional royalty revenues .
however , as production from these leases has grown , and as oil and gas prices have risen far above 1995 levels , serious questions have been raised about the extent to which taxpayer interests have been protected .
many of these entities have also amplified questions about whether the oil and gas industry is paying its fair share of royalties , especially in light of rapidly rising oil and gas prices , record industry profits , and a highly constrained federal budgetary environment .
gao has expressed similar concerns , and the u.s. comptroller general has highlighted royalty relief as an area needing additional oversight by the 110th congress .
these deep water regions are particularly costly to explore and develop .
specifically , my testimony ( 1 ) discusses the likely fiscal impacts of royalty relief for leases issued under the deep water royalty relief act of 1995 and ( 2 ) describes other authorities for granting royalty relief that could further impact future royalty collections .
to date , about $1 billion has already been lost .
these concerns were brought into stark relief when it was learned that mms issued leases in 1998 and 1999 that failed to include in the lease contracts the price thresholds above which royalty relief would no longer be applicable , making large volumes of oil and natural gas exempt from royalties and significantly affecting the amount of royalty revenues collected by the federal government .
in fiscal year 2006 , oil and gas companies received over $77 billion from the sale of oil and gas produced from federal lands and waters , and the minerals management service ( mms ) , the department of the interior's ( interior ) agency responsible for collecting royalties , reported that these companies paid the federal government about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties .
additional royalty relief , potentially affecting future federal royalty collection , is offered under other programs and legislation .
recently , congressional committees , the department of the interior's office of the inspector general , public interest groups , and the press have questioned whether our nation's oil and gas royalties are being properly managed .
when the government grants royalty relief , it typically specifies the amounts of oil and gas production that will be exempt from royalties and may also specify that royalty relief is applicable only if oil and gas prices remain below certain levels , known as “price thresholds.” for example , the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act of 1995 , also known as the deep water royalty relief act ( dwrra ) , mandated royalty relief for oil and gas leases issued in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico from 1996 to 2000 .
more specifically , royalty relief can be provided under two existing authorities: ( 1 ) the secretary of the interior's discretionary authority and ( 2 ) the energy policy act of 2005 .
clearly , such large and financially significant resources must be carefully developed and managed so that our nation's rising energy needs are met while at the same time the american people are ensured of receiving a fair rate of return on publicly owned resources , especially in light of the nation's current and long - range fiscal challenges .
