our objectives were to ( 1 ) examine the design characteristics of these programs that have implications for flexibility , accountability , and programs' ability to collect information about performance as envisioned in the results act ; ( 2 ) identify the kinds and sources of performance information that programs with various characteristics have utilized and the strengths and weaknesses of this information ; and ( 3 ) provide guidance to legislators and agency officials concerning the information collection options available for programs with various designs .
the study covered 21 programs in diverse policy areas , from transportation to community mental health .
with block grant proposals on the horizon in education and other areas and the first performance plans now in under the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra or the results act ) , this topic could hardly be more timely .
congress today faces the difficult question: can grant programs be designed to promote flexibility at the state or local level as in traditional block grants , yet still provide the information needed to ensure accountability and support federal policy decisions ? .
in response to your request , we conducted a comparative study of block grants and similar programs that give state or local governments substantial flexibility in determining how funds are to be used .
intergovernmental grant programs — and particularly those with the flexibility inherent in classic block grant design — may be particularly likely to have difficulty producing performance measures at the national level and raise delicate issues of accountability .
it requires each federal agency to develop a multiyear strategic plan that ( 1 ) states the agency's mission ; ( 2 ) identifies long - term strategic goals for each major function or operation ; ( 3 ) describes how the agency intends to achieve those goals ; ( 4 ) shows how annual performance goals relate to strategic goals ; ( 5 ) identifies key factors beyond the agency's control that could affect achievement of strategic goals ; and ( 6 ) describes how program evaluations informed the plan and provides a schedule of future program evaluations .
grants to state and local governments have historically been classified as either categorical grants or block grants .
studies of the early implementation of the act suggest that programs that do not deliver a readily measurable product or service are likely to have difficulty meeting results act performance measurement and reporting requirements .
conversely , some initially categorical grants ( such as special programs for aging — supportive services and senior centers ) have broadened and increased local flexibility over time and now look much like block grants .
agency strategic plans are the starting point for agencies to set annual goals for programs and to measure the performance of programs in achieving those goals .
the combined coverage of related specific programs may be poorly matched to local needs , and differing eligibility and reporting requirements complicate program administration for service providers who receive funds from multiple grants .
consistent with their historic aim of devolving federal program responsibilities to , or supporting programs at , the state or local level , the block grants of the past ( such as those of the 1980s ) had limited administrative and reporting requirements .
