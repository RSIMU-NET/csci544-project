during the late 1990s , the senate environment and public works committee identified concerns regarding excessive use of rais that resulted in unnecessary increased costs and schedule delays .
the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the independent nuclear regulatory agency of the united states , reviews about 2,500 licensing actions per year in its regulation of commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials , such as in nuclear medicine , through licensing , inspection , and enforcement of nrc's requirements .
through the licensing process , nrc may authorize an applicant to conduct the following activities: ( 1 ) construct , operate , and decommission commercial reactors and fuel cycle facilities ; ( 2 ) possess , use , process , export and import nuclear materials and waste , and handle certain aspects of their transportation ; and ( 3 ) site , design , construct , operate , and close waste disposal facilities .
this report examines: ( 1 ) nrc's guidance for developing and issuing rais and how it differs across offices ; ( 2 ) how many rais nrc has issued over the past 5 years and the kinds of activities that elicit rais ; and ( 3 ) strengths and weaknesses of nrc's processes to develop rais identified by nrc and licensees , and the actions nrc is taking to address concerns .
three nrc offices are responsible for reviewing and approving licensing actions and associated rais: the office of new reactors , which is responsible for licensing and processing license amendment requests for new reactors ; the office of nuclear reactor regulation , which is responsible for licensing for operating nuclear power reactors ; and the office of nuclear material safety and safeguards , which is responsible for the safe and secure production of nuclear fuel ; the safe storage , transportation , and disposal of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel ; and the transportation of certain radioactive material .
nrc's use of rais has come under scrutiny in the past .
we interviewed licensees by using a standard set of questions that included questions about: ( 1 ) the licensees' experience with rais , ( 2 ) the effect of rais on site operations , ( 3 ) nrc guidance pertaining to rais , ( 4 ) past and current challenges with rais , and ( 5 ) strengths and weaknesses of the rai process .
to become licensed for the aforementioned activities ( or to amend , renew , or transfer an existing license ) , an entity must submit an application to nrc and , if applicable , respond to any requests for additional information ( rai ) from nrc staff .
these offices operate under the executive director for operations , the arm of nrc that carries out the policies and decisions of the five - member nuclear regulatory commission .
more recently , in 2015 , nrc's inspector general cited concerns about rais in a report on oversight of spent fuel pools , including the amount of time it took to complete the rai process and the resources required to conduct and review complex research and analyses requested through rais .
in other cases , agency staff may use rais to obtain information missing from an initial application , such as qualifications of applicants using nuclear materials for medical purposes .
