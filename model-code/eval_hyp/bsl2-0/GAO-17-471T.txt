specifically , this statement addresses doj's ( 1 ) law enforcement activities ; ( 2 ) custody and care of federal prisoners and inmates ; ( 3 ) grant management and administration ; and ( 4 ) use of alternative sources of funding , such as fines , fees , and penalties .
in fiscal year 2016 , doj's enacted budget was about $29 billion and its appropriation was among the top 10 of all federal agencies .
with the federal government currently facing an unsustainable long - term fiscal path , it is increasingly important for doj and other executive branch agencies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs .
in some of these program areas , doj has sole responsibility , while in others doj works with other departments and agencies .
this statement addresses four key areas in which we have issued reports and highlights our recommendations to doj to enhance program efficiency and resource management .
doj has a leading role in administering a wide variety of programs to fulfill its mission to , among other things , enforce the law and provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime .
as requested , my testimony today is based on our recent work examining programs across an array of doj components .
in each of these areas , we discuss a number of our products that encapsulate how doj is accomplishing its mission .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss our prior work on ways in which the department of justice ( doj ) can increase efficiencies and better manage its resources across key programs .
for our prior work , we analyzed documentation , such as program policies and procedures , and interviewed doj officials responsible for the identified doj programs .
this statement is based on reports we issued from february 2012 to november 2016 , and includes updates on selected reports as of march 2017 .
to update the status of doj's efforts to address the recommendations we made in these reports , we collected information from doj program officials on actions they have taken or planned in response .
more information about the scope and methodology of our prior work can be found in those reports .
congress appropriated $2.4 billion for doj discretionary grant programs in fiscal year 2016 .
we conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
we believe the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
doj could better assess federal incarceration initiatives .
doj has addressed recommendations to reduce the risk of grant program overlap and unnecessary duplication .
in june 2015 , we reported that doj could better measure the efficacy of three key new initiatives designed to address federal incarceration challenges , such as overcrowding and rising costs .
doj has the ability to fund programs using money it collects through alternative sources , such as fines , fees , and penalties , in addition to the budget authority congress provides doj through annual appropriations .
