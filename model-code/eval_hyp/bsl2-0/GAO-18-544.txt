irs estimated that it prevented at least $10.6 billion ( 86 percent ) of that amount but paid at least $1.7 billion in invalid refunds .
we reviewed irs's replacement plans for its legacy fraud detection system and release plans outlining requirements and capabilities for rrp .
the internal revenue service ( irs ) faces an ongoing challenge to detect and prevent noncompliance with tax laws .
noncompliance and fraud threaten the integrity of the tax system , costing the federal government billions of dollars annually .
we compared irs's efforts to goals and objectives identified in its strategic plan: fy2018-2022 , such as encouraging compliance through tax administration and enforcement and increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness .
irs estimated that at least $12.2 billion in idt tax refund fraud was attempted during 2016 .
every year taxpayers willfully or unintentionally fail to pay hundreds of billions of dollars owed in taxes .
we reviewed reports from the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) on irs's development of rrp and rrp's capabilities .
congressional action on these issues would help irs better leverage rrp's capabilities .
this report ( 1 ) describes how rrp detects and selects suspicious returns to prevent invalid refunds ; ( 2 ) assesses how irs monitors and adapts rrp ; and ( 3 ) examines what else , if anything , irs can do to strengthen rrp and use it to address other enforcement issues .
in 2015 we added irs's efforts to address identity theft ( idt ) tax refund fraud to the high - risk area .
irs's enforcement of tax laws has been on our high - risk list since the list was first established in 1990 .
this noncompliance includes individuals who make inadvertent mistakes and fraudsters who intentionally seek to evade taxes and obtain invalid refunds .
detecting fraudulent tax returns has become increasingly difficult for irs as fraudsters gain access to more personal and financial information , which they use to file returns that appear legitimate .
one of irs's preventive tools is the return review program ( rrp ) , a pre - refund system that screens individual returns claiming refunds using characteristics predictive of idt and other refund fraud .
further , rrp has the potential to improve tax enforcement in other areas such as underreporting and audit selection if irs can successfully expand rrp's detection and selection capabilities to analyze individual tax returns , including those not claiming refunds , for fraud and noncompliance .
we compared irs's efforts to the standards for internal control in the federal government that directs officials to establish and operate ongoing monitoring activities to determine the effectiveness of systems such as rrp and take corrective action as appropriate .
we also reviewed our prior work and recommendations related to irs's tax enforcement activities .
given the importance of rrp for preventing billions of dollars in invalid refund payments , you asked us to examine rrp's capabilities .
we also assessed irs's monitoring and evaluation of rrp against leading practices to combat fraud in a strategic , risk - based manner as identified in the framework for managing fraud risks in federal programs ( the fraud risk framework ) .
