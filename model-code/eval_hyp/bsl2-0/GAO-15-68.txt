this report examines ( 1 ) the impact of allowing majority - owned portfolio companies to participate in agency sbir programs and ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies have elected to expand their sbir programs to include majority - owned portfolio companies .
in fiscal year 2013 , federal agencies made more than 4,000 awards totaling more than $2.1 billion through the sbir program .
in 1982 , congress established the sbir program to , among other things , stimulate technological innovation related to federal agency goals and missions , use small businesses to meet federal research or research and development ( r&d ) needs , and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal r&d .
to address our objectives , we obtained and reviewed the written determinations submitted by the agencies to sba and congress â€” that is , those submitted by the department of energy ( doe ) and national institutes of health ( nih ) .
we also reviewed the ndaa and related congressional record and hearings on sbir ; sba's proposed and final rules implementing the ndaa by revising the eligibility criteria for sbir , including comment letters submitted in response to the proposed rule ; and sba's sbir policy directive , annual reports , and other related material .
our analysis of the impact focuses on determining which agencies opened their sbir programs to majority - owned portfolio companies and how many of these companies applied for and received sbir awards .
the ndaa reauthorized the sbir program through fiscal year 2017 and included provisions that allow sbir participating agencies to permit majority - owned portfolio companies to participate in their sbir programs .
in order to allow such companies to participate , sbir participating agencies must submit a written determination to sba and congress , explaining how making sbir awards to such companies will , among other things , induce additional venture capital funding of small business innovations and substantially contribute to the agency's mission .
in addition , the ndaa mandates that gao conduct a study of the impact of requirements related to participation in the sbir program by majority - owned portfolio companies and issue a report every 3 years , with the first report due by december 31 , 2014 .
starting in 2013 , implementation of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 ( ndaa ) enabled agencies to allow small businesses that are majority owned by multiple venture capital operating companies , hedge funds , or private equity firms ( majority - owned portfolio companies ) to participate in the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program .
the act allows but does not require agencies to permit majority - owned portfolio companies to participate in their sbir programs .
in december 2012 , sba issued a final rule to implement the ndaa provisions and revise sbir's eligibility criteria to include majority - owned portfolio companies , which became effective in january 2013 .
we also reviewed and analyzed sbir data on solicitations , applications , and awards from doe and nih during fiscal years 2013 and 2014 , to identify awards made to majority - owned portfolio companies ; data from the other nine sbir participating agencies on sbir awards they made during fiscal year 2013 ; and data on majority - owned portfolio companies and other small businesses registered with sba .
