to conduct that work , we reviewed guidance processes at 25 components that engaged in regulatory or grant - making activities in four departments — agriculture ( usda ) , education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , and labor ( dol ) .
guidance documents provide agencies valuable flexibility to clarify their requirements and policies , and to address new issues and circumstances more quickly than may be possible using rulemaking .
although not legally binding , guidance documents can have far - reaching effects .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) defines the term “guidance document” as an agency statement of general applicability and future effect , other than a regulatory action , that sets forth a policy on a statutory , regulatory , or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue .
regulatory guidance is an important tool that agencies use to communicate timely information about the implementation of regulatory and grant programs to regulated parties , grantees , and the general public .
how can agencies ensure more effective guidance processes that adhere to applicable criteria ? .
the scope of that review focused on guidance issued to external parties that explained regulatory and grant - related requirements and other policies .
guidance documents can vary — by type , purpose , and amount — among agencies and subcomponents of the same agency , and have often been reported to outnumber regulations in terms of the number of documents issued annually .
how do agencies use regulatory guidance ? .

what is regulatory guidance ? .
my remarks today highlight answers to four key questions addressed in our april 2015 report on regulatory guidance processes: 1 .
guidance can take a variety of formats and names including directives , interpretive memorandums , fact sheets , and dear colleague letters .
how do agencies determine whether to issue guidance or undertake rulemaking ? .

we also recommended that usda , education , hhs , and dol strengthen the use of internal controls in guidance production processes and improve online guidance dissemination .
we identified both opportunities for improved internal controls related to guidance and highlighted agency practices that could be applied to guidance processes in other agencies .
we recommended that hhs and dol ensure consistent application of omb requirements for guidance .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our report on regulatory guidance processes , which we issued earlier this year .
we selected and applied four government - wide internal control standards to guidance processes .
as shown in figure 1 , guidance may explain how agencies plan to interpret regulations .
however , stronger application of internal controls would help ensure that guidance processes achieve desired results and prevent errors .
all four agencies generally agreed with the recommendations .
although guidance documents are not legally binding , they can affect the actions of stakeholders and other interested parties , as well as agencies' staffs , because guidance articulates agencies' interpretations and policy choices .
we reviewed agencies' written procedures , guidance documents , and websites .
components primarily relied on websites to disseminate guidance , but could do more to improve online access , such as making guidance documents easier to find and ensuring that they are current .
