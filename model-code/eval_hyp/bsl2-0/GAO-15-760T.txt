to address these objectives , we analyzed data and reviewed program documents provided by usaid and its implementing partners , including the united nations ( un ) food and agriculture organization ( fao ) , the un world food programme ( wfp ) , and selected nongovernmental organizations ( ngo ) .
my testimony summarizes the findings from our report issued in march of this year , which had two objectives: ( 1 ) to review usaid's processes for awarding and modifying cash - based food assistance projects and ( 2 ) to assess the extent to which usaid and its implementing partners have implemented financial controls to help ensure appropriate oversight of such projects .
in fiscal year 2014 , ffp's funding of targeted cash transfer and food voucher programs amounted to about $410 million , the majority of which was for the syria crisis ; in fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , it totaled about $991 million .
in addressing humanitarian crises around the world , usaid currently implements a cash - based program — the emergency food security program ( efsp ) — through its office of food for peace ( ffp ) , with funding from the international disaster assistance account .
to review usaid's processes for awarding and modifying cash - based food assistance projects , we reviewed usaid's program guidance and relevant directives , as well as grant proposals and agreements .
in addition , ffp manages the majority of u.s. international food assistance — primarily in - kind food aid commodities — authorized by title ii of the food for peace act , which in fiscal year 2015 totaled about $1.47 billion .
given that ffp's cash - based projects are to monitor market conditions to detect significant changes that may warrant project modifications , we also analyzed price data for key staple commodities in selected markets in four case study countries: jordan , to assess the extent to which usaid and kenya , niger , and somalia.the implementing partners implemented financial controls , we reviewed documentation and reports related to the cash and voucher distributions in our case study countries , and assessed the controls they have designed and implemented against their policies , procedures , guidance ; federal internal control standards ; and international principles and guidelines .
we also met with officials representing ngos that were awarded efsp grants to serve as implementing partners in carrying out u.s. food assistance programs overseas or were sub - awardees for usaid grants awarded to wfp ( and in some cases were both ) .
in washington , d.c. , we interviewed officials from the department of state ( state ) , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , and usaid .
in recent years , the united states has joined other major donors in increasingly providing food assistance in the form of cash or vouchers .
for over 60 years , the united states has provided assistance to food - insecure countries primarily in the form of food commodities procured in the united states and transported overseas .
thank you for this opportunity to discuss our recent work reviewing international food assistance delivered through cash transfers or voucher programs funded and overseen by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .
