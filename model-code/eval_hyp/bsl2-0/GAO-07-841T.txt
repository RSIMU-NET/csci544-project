specifically , we examined how fra ( 1 ) focuses its efforts on the highest priority risks related to train accidents in planning its safety oversight , ( 2 ) identifies safety problems on railroad systems in carrying out its oversight , and ( 3 ) assesses the impact of its oversight efforts on safety .
1. ) .
serious accidents resulting in injuries , deaths , and property damage continue to occur .
my remarks center on work we have recently completed on fra's overall safety oversight strategy .
although the overall safety record in the railroad industry , as measured by the number of train accidents per million miles traveled , has improved markedly since 1980 , there has been little sustained improvement over the past decade .
fra uses a broad range of goals and measures to assess the impact of its oversight efforts on safety .
 ( see fig .
these initiatives — which include new regulations , research on new technologies and approaches for improving safety , and new vehicles for inspecting track — are promising .
we appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing today to discuss the federal railroad administration's ( fra's ) rail safety oversight activities .
our work focused on fra oversight efforts to reduce the rate of train accidents rather than those to reduce highway - rail crossing and trespassing accidents because ( 1 ) the department of transportation's inspector general has recently assessed efforts to reduce highway - rail crossing accidents and ( 2 ) trespassing accidents primarily involve issues not related to railroad safety performance .
it includes initiatives to address the two main causes of train accidents — human factors and defective track — and fra has pursued some additional initiatives to address these causes since issuing the plan .
furthermore , the ability of many of these efforts to improve safety will depend on voluntary actions by railroads .
in planning its safety oversight , fra is focusing its efforts on the highest priority risks related to train accidents through various initiatives aimed at addressing the main causes of these accidents as well as through improvements in its inspection planning approach .
for example , it has developed new goals to target its inspection and enforcement efforts at reducing various types of railroad accidents and related measures to track its progress .
our work was based on a review of laws , regulations , and fra plans and guidance as well as discussions with fra officials and with a range of external stakeholders , including railroads , unions , and state railroad safety organizations .
this plan provides a reasonable framework for guiding the agency's efforts to improve its oversight .
however , fra lacks measures of the direct results of its inspection and enforcement programs , such as measures of the extent to which these programs have resulted in the correction of identified safety problems .
the agency's overall strategy for targeting its oversight at the greatest risks is the national rail safety action plan , which fra issued in may 2005 .
however , most of them have not yet been fully implemented , and their overall impact on safety will probably not be apparent for a number of years .
