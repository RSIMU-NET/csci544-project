specifically , i will cover ( 1 ) progress and challenges in coordinating geospatial data , and ( 2 ) the current status of agencies implementation of gao's recommendations .
in november 2012 , we reported that while the president and the office of management and budget ( omb ) had established policies and procedures for coordinating investments in geospatial data , governmentwide committees and selected federal departments and agencies had not effectively implemented them .
in that report , we made multiple recommendations to omb and federal agencies to improve coordination and reduce duplication among geospatial data investments .
in 2012 , the department of the interior estimated that the federal government was investing billions of dollars on geospatial data annually , and that duplication was common .
the federal government collects , maintains , and uses geospatial information to support many functions , including national security and disaster response .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the importance of coordinating federal investments in geospatial information — information linked to specific geographic locations — in order to avoid duplication .
my testimony today will summarize the results of that report .
our november 2012 report made numerous recommendations aimed at improving coordination and reducing duplication of geospatial data .
however , much remains to be done to implement and enforce the policies and to achieve cost savings to the federal government .
in our most recent duplication report , we reported that better coordination among federal agencies that collect , maintain , and use geospatial information could help reduce duplication of geospatial investments and provide the opportunity for potential savings of millions of dollars .
for many years , the federal government has taken steps to coordinate geospatial activities both within and outside the federal government .
the duplication report reiterated the need for action among several federal agencies , fgdc , and omb .
over the past few years , we have issued a series of reports that have identified federal programs and functional areas where unnecessary duplication , overlap , or fragmentation exists ; the actions needed to address such conditions ; and the potential financial and other benefits of in particular , we identified opportunities to reduce duplication doing so.and the cost of government operations in several critical it areas .
the plan , at a minimum , should include ( 1 ) a vision statement for the nsdi ; ( 2 ) outcome - oriented goals and objectives that address all aspects of the nsdi ; ( 3 ) a description of how the goals and objectives are to be achieved , including a description of the resources needed to achieve the goals and objectives and how fgdc is to work with other agencies to achieve them ; ( 4 ) performance measures for achieving the stated goals ; and ( 5 ) external factors that could affect the achievement of the goals and objectives .
now , a year later , there has been some progress in improving policies and procedures for coordinating the geospatial investments .
until fgdc , federal departments and agencies , and omb decide that investments in geospatial information are a priority , these investments will remain uncoordinated , and the federal government will continue to acquire duplicative geospatial information and waste taxpayer dollars .
