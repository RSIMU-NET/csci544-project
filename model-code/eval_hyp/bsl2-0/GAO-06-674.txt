several federal and state agencies and self - regulatory organizations enforce these laws , including the federal trade commission ( ftc ) ; the banking regulators — board of governors of the federal reserve system ( frb ) , office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) , office of thrift supervision ( ots ) , federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) , and national credit union administration ( ncua ) ; the securities regulators — securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , nasd ( formerly known as the national association of securities dealers ) , and new york stock exchange regulation ( nyse regulation ) ; and state insurance regulators .
the primary federal laws governing the sharing and use of personal information by private sector companies are the fair credit reporting act ( fcra ) and subtitle a of title v of the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) .
information resellers include consumer reporting agencies ( cra ) , which assemble and share credit histories and other personal information used to help make important decisions about individuals , such as their eligibility for financial services .
in addition , security breaches at some of these companies have raised concerns in light of the increasing problem of identity theft .
some policymakers and consumer advocates believe that not enough is known about these resellers and the information about consumers that they maintain and share .
advances in technology and the computerization of public records in recent years have fostered significant growth in the size of the reseller industry and the amount of personal consumer data that these companies assemble and distribute .
concerned about financial institutions' use of information resellers , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) how financial institutions use data products supplied by information resellers , the types of information contained in these products , and the sources of the information ; ( 2 ) how federal laws governing the privacy and security of personal data apply to information resellers , and what rights and opportunities exist for individuals to view and correct data held by resellers ; ( 3 ) how federal financial institution regulators and the ftc oversee information resellers' compliance with federal privacy and information security laws ; and ( 4 ) how federal financial institution regulators , state insurance regulators , and the ftc oversee financial institutions' compliance with federal privacy and information security laws governing consumer information , including information supplied by information resellers .
information resellers maintain and sell vast amounts of detailed personal information on nearly all american consumers — including such things as social security numbers , home and automobile values , occupations and hobbies .
the growth in recent years of information resellers — companies that collect , aggregate , and resell publicly available and private information on individuals — has raised privacy and security concerns related to this industry .
other companies , sometimes called “data brokers,” collect personal information from a variety of sources for such things as marketing and fraud prevention .
to address these objectives , we gathered and analyzed documents , and interviewed representatives from , 10 major information resellers ; 14 financial institutions in the banking , securities , credit card , property / casualty insurance , and consumer lending industry sectors ; and trade associations representing these firms .
