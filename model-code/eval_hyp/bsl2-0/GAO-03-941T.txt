although congress has passed a number of laws to protect the security of personal information , the continued use of and reliance on ssns by private and public sector entities and the potential for misuse underscores the importance of identifying areas that can be further strengthened .
although the social security administration ( ssa ) originally created ssns as a means to track worker's earnings and eligibility for social security benefits , over time the ssn has come to be used for a myriad of purposes .
my remarks today will focus on describing ( 1 ) public and private sector use and display of ssns and ( 2 ) ssa's role in preventing the proliferation of false identities .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss ways to better protect social security numbers ( ssn ) to help prevent the proliferation of false identities whether for financial misuse or for assuming an individual's identity .
in summary , public and some private sector entities rely extensively on ssns .
allegations of ssn misuse include , for example , incidents where a criminal uses the ssn of another individual for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining credit , acquiring goods , violating immigration laws , or fleeing the criminal justice system .
to improve customer service , some state and local government entities are considering placing more public records on the internet .
factors such as cost , problems with system reliability , and state priorities and policies determine whether or not states use ssa's service .
certain laws have helped to restrict the use of ssns and other information by these private sector entities to specific purposes .
we reported last year that federal , state , and county government agencies rely extensively on the ssn to manage records , verify eligibility of benefit applicants , collect outstanding debt , and conduct research and program evaluations .
unfortunately , design and management weaknesses associated with ssa's verification service have limited its effectiveness .
my testimony is based on a report we did for this subcommittee on government uses of the ssn , ongoing work that focuses on private sector ssn uses , and work we are completing on ssa's enumeration process and the agency's verification of ssns for state driver licensing .
other areas remain vulnerable and could be targeted by those seeking fraudulent ssns .
accordingly , you asked us to talk about the uses of ssns and ways that the integrity of the ssn may be preserved .
however , as a result of the increased use and availability of ssn information and other data , more and more personal information is being centralized into various corporate and public databases .
this is particularly true of entities that amass public and private data , including ssns , for resale .
ssns are also displayed on a number of public record documents that are routinely made available to the public .
in addition , some private sector entities have come to rely on the ssn as an identifier , using it and other information to accumulate information about individuals .
however , without further system improvements and assurance that field offices will comply fully with the new policies and procedures this effort may be less effective than it could be .
