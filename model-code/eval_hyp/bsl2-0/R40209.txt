the nara system currently includes the libraries of 12 former presidents: ( 1 ) george h. w. bush ( college station , texas ) ; ( 2 ) jimmy carter ( atlanta , georgia ) ; ( 3 ) william j. clinton ( little rock , arkansas ) ; ( 4 ) dwight d. eisenhower ( abilene , kansas ) ; ( 5 ) gerald r. ford ( ann arbor , michigan ) ; ( 6 ) herbert hoover ( west branch , iowa ) ; ( 7 ) lyndon b. johnson ( austin , texas ) ; ( 8 ) john f. kennedy ( boston , massachusetts ) ; ( 9 ) richard m. nixon ( yorba linda , california ) ; ( 10 ) ronald reagan ( simi valley , california ) ; ( 11 ) franklin d. roosevelt ( hyde park , new york ) ; and ( 12 ) harry s. truman ( independence , missouri ) .
contributions from foreign sources have also been a concern , including during senate consideration of hillary clinton's nomination as secretary of state .
some members of congress have expressed concern that the lack of public disclosure — or private fundraising altogether — invites potential conflicts of interest from those wishing to influence sitting or former presidents through library contributions .
apparently unrelated to the clinton nomination , the house passed h.r .
requiring additional disclosure surrounding library fundraising could increase transparency and potentially discourage conflicts of interest .

second , funds appropriated to the national archives and records administration ( nara ) cover the cost of archiving and managing presidential papers housed at the libraries .
through agreements negotiated by the archives and foundations affiliated with each facility , nara eventually takes control of most presidential libraries .
in response to these varied missions , two sources provide funds to construct and maintain presidential libraries .
amounts and sources of library fundraising would continue to be unlimited .
presidential libraries serve not only as repositories of official papers , but also as museums and monuments to the nation's leaders .
