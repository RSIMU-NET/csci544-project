such practices are embodied in the clinger - cohen act of 1996 and other legislative and regulatory requirements , as well as accepted industry system / software engineering models , such as those published by the software engineering institute ( sei ) .
recognizing this , the congress enacted the customs modernization and informed compliance act , or “mod” act , to define legislative requirements for improving import processing through an automated system .
customs fully recognizes the severity of the problems with its approach to managing import trade and is modernizing its import processes and undertaking ace as its import system solution .
begun in 1994 , customs' estimate of the system's 15-year life cycle cost is about $1.05 billion , although this estimate is being revised upwards .
customs' existing import processes and supporting systems are simply not responsive to the business needs of either customs or the trade community , whose members collectively import about $1 trillion in goods annually .
through ace , customs intends to implement much needed improvements in the way it currently enforces import trade laws and regulations and assesses and collects import duties , taxes , and fees , which total $22 billion annually .
in light of ace's enormous mission importance and price tag , customs' approach to investing in and engineering ace demands disciplined and rigorous management practices .
the ace weaknesses are ( 1 ) building ace without a complete and enforced enterprise systems architecture , ( 2 ) investing in ace without a firm basis for knowing that it is a cost - effective system solution , and ( 3 ) building ace without employing engineering rigor and discipline .
unfortunately , customs has not employed such practices to date on ace .
these existing processes and systems are paper - intensive , error - prone , and transaction - based , and they are out of step with the just - in - time inventory practices used by the trade .
customs agrees with our findings , and it is committed to implementing our recommendations .
the need to leverage information technology to improve the way that customs does business in the import arena is undeniable .
my testimony will address each of these points as well as our recommendations for correcting them .
our february 1999 report on ace , upon which my testimony today is based , describes serious management and technical weaknesses in customs' management of ace .
my statement will focus on customs' automated commercial environment , better known as ace .
our reviews of agency system modernization efforts over the last 5 years point to weaknesses in these three areas as the root causes of their not delivering promised system capabilities on time andwithin budget .
as such , the clinger - cohen act requires agency chief information officers ( cio ) to develop , maintain , and implement an information technology ( it ) architecture .
thank you for inviting me to participate in today's customs service oversight hearing .
fortunately , customs fully recognizes the seriousness of the situation and has committed to correcting its ace management and technical weaknesses .
also , the office of management and budget ( omb ) issued guidance in 1996 that requires agency it investments to be architecturally compliant .
