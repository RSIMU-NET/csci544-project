under medicare advantage , cms approves private companies to offer health plan options that include all medicare - covered services .
in addition , many plans provide supplemental benefits , such as a reduction in the enrollee's required cost sharing ( e.g. , beneficiaries' part b premiums ) or coverage for items and services not included under the traditional fee - for - service program , such as dental care .
according to cms , in fiscal year 2006 , over 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries — or about 7 million of the approximately 43 million — were enrolled in a medicare advantage plan .
in fiscal year 2006 , cms estimated it spent over $51 billion on the medicare advantage program , which serves as an alternative to medicare's traditional fee - for - service program .
our review covered cms audits for contract years 2001 through 2006 .
bba requires cms to annually audit the financial records ( including data relating to medicare utilization and costs ) of at least one - third of the organizations participating in the medicare advantage program .
we are pleased to be here today to testify on the results of our review of the centers for medicare & medicaid services' ( cms ) audit activities related to medicare advantage ( ma ) organizations that was mandated by the balanced budget act ( bba ) of 1997 .
the findings in our latest review cause us continuing concern about the audit process .
bba also requires us to monitor cms' audit activities .
for those audits that cms completed , it did not consistently ensure that the audit process provided information needed for assessing the potential impact on beneficiaries , and cms took limited action to follow - up on the audit findings .
in summary , we found that the required audits were of limited value , which is similar to what we reported on audits for contract year 2000 in october 2001 , when we last reviewed cms' audit activities under bba .
our results are documented in our july report , medicare advantage: required audits of limited value .
cms did not document its process to determine whether it met the requirement to audit the financial records of at least one - third of the participating organizations for contract years 2001 through 2006 , and based on our analysis of available cms data , cms did not meet that requirement .
inaction or untimely audit resolution also undermines the presumed deterrent effect of audit efforts .
we also recommended that cms amend its implementing regulations for the medicare advantage program and prescription drug program to provide that all contracts cms enters into with ma organizations and prescription drug plan sponsors include terms that inform these organizations of the audits and give cms authority to address identified deficiencies , including pursuit of financial recoveries .
specifically , we will tell you about: the adjusted community rate proposal ( acrp ) and bid process and the related audit requirement for organizations that participate in the medicare advantage program , cms' efforts to comply with the audit requirement for organizations' acrp and bid submissions , and factors that cause cms' audit process to be of limited value .
