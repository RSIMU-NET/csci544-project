the recent imposition of several large civil money penalties on depository institutions has increased concern about industry compliance with and government enforcement of the bsa .
specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) recent enforcement actions taken against depository institutions for bsa violations , ( 2 ) inspectors general reports assessing the regulators' examination work and enforcement activities , and ( 3 ) issues raised in some of our past work on money laundering and ongoing work on bsa examinations and enforcement for the committee .
in examining depository institutions for bsa compliance , the regulators' examination procedures are to serve as a tool for determining whether depository institutions ( 1 ) have developed aml programs and procedures to adequately detect , deter , and report unusual or suspicious activities possibly related to money laundering ; and ( 2 ) comply with the technical recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the bsa .
my statement today will focus on the banking regulators' approach for ensuring compliance with bsa and aml program requirements .
congress amended the bsa in 1994 to require federal financial banking regulators to develop enhanced examination procedures and training to improve the identification of possible money - laundering schemes at financial institutions under their supervision .
federal banking regulators regularly assess compliance with bsa and related aml requirements during safety and soundness or compliance examinations using examination procedures that are consistent with their overall risk - focused examination approach .
the most recent changes arose in october 2001 with the passage of the usa patriot act , which , among other things , contains expanded provisions to prevent , detect , and prosecute terrorist financing and international money laundering at depository institutions and extends anti - money laundering ( aml ) requirements to other financial service providers previously not covered under the bsa .
the u.s. government's framework for preventing , detecting , and prosecuting money laundering has been expanding through additional pieces of legislation since its inception in 1970 with the bank secrecy act .
over the years , the bsa has evolved into an important tool to help deter money laundering , drug trafficking , terrorist financing , and other financial crimes .
the regulators also have a variety of enforcement tools to address noncompliance .
they can take increasingly formal supervisory actions that range from moral suasion or informal discussions with the institution's management to written agreements , civil money penalties , and cease and desist orders .
to address these objectives , we reviewed consent orders and other documents pertaining to selected enforcement actions , recent department of the treasury ( treasury ) and federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) office of inspector general reports , past gao reports , and documents related to our ongoing bsa work for this committee .
under the risk - focused approach , those activities judged to pose the highest risk to an institution are to receive the most scrutiny by examiners .
i appreciate this opportunity to be here today to discuss a number of issues concerning federal depository institution regulators' oversight of financial institutions for bank secrecy act ( bsa ) compliance and our ongoing work for this committee on this matter .
the purpose of the bsa is to prevent financial institutions from being used as intermediaries for the transfer or deposit of money derived from criminal activity and to provide a paper trail for law enforcement agencies in their investigations of possible money laundering .
