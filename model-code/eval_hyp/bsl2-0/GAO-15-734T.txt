auction and sales held during the summer of 2014 , ( 2 ) blm's administration of the act's tolling provision , and ( 3 ) upcoming decisions blm faces as it continues implementing the act .
those two noncompetitive sales offered more than 1 billion cubic feet of crude helium to refiners .
as of the end of fiscal year 2013 , roughly 9 billion cubic feet of crude helium remained in federal ownership .
blm is responsible for implementing the 2013 act .
my testimony highlights the key findings of our april 2015 report on blm's implementation of the helium stewardship act of 2013 and includes updated information concerning actions blm has taken since the report's issuance .
two weeks later , in august 2014 , in two noncompetitive sales , blm sold the remaining helium that was to be made available for delivery in fiscal year 2015 and a portion of the helium to be made available for delivery in fiscal year 2016 .
however , the act does not require a refiner to toll if the in july 2014 , blm held its first - ever competitive auction for crude helium , offering about 93 million cubic feet of the helium that it planned to make available for delivery in fiscal year 2015 to qualified bidders , both refiners and nonrefiners .
subsequently , the helium privatization act of 1996 required interior to offer nearly all of this crude helium for sale .
for many of its uses , helium has no substitute .
in october 2013 , the helium stewardship act of 2013 was enacted ; the act is intended to complete the privatization of the federal helium reserve in a competitive market fashion that ensures stability in the helium markets , while protecting the interests of american taxpayers , among other things .
these uses include national security applications , scientific research , medical instruments , and manufacturing .
the federal government has been extensively involved in the production , storage , and use of helium since the early 20th century .
during the 1960s and 1970s , interior purchased about 34 billion cubic feet of helium from private crude helium producers .
blm faces a number of decisions about its continued implementation of the act , including decisions related to its upcoming fiscal year 2016 helium auction and sale .
gao - 15-394 .
the act establishes a phased process through fiscal year 2021 for interior to dispose of the remaining helium in the federal helium reserve .
helium is an important nonrenewable natural resource with a variety of federal and private uses .
as a condition of sale or auction to a refiner during the first two phases , the refiner must make excess refining capacity available at commercially reasonable rates to persons who acquire helium from blm after the act's enactment.refiner and a nonrefiner do not agree on terms for tolling .
the act requires blm to conduct each auction using a method that maximizes revenue to the federal the act also contains a tolling provision , which states that government .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our april 2015 report regarding the department of the interior's ( interior ) bureau of land management's ( blm ) implementation of the helium stewardship act of 2013 .
