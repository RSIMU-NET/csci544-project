as requested , our testimony today , will discuss ( 1 ) the age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce ; ( 2 ) the strategies federal agencies are using to recruit , hire , and retain older workers ; and ( 3 ) our observations on how these strategies position federal agencies to engage and retain older workers .
in reviewing strategies federal agencies use to recruit , hire , and retain older workers , we interviewed officials in selected agencies , including the departments of agriculture , housing and urban development ( hud ) , labor , and state , as well as the internal revenue service ( irs ) , environmental protection agency ( epa ) , nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , and the social security administration ( ssa ) .
historically , the federal government has faced challenges hiring and retaining talented workers in key fields , and the looming retirement wave in federal agencies will only exacerbate these challenges .
as a result , the federal government and other employers may face increased competition in hiring skilled workers , and unless they develop effective retention strategies , employers will need to look more aggressively for workers with the right skills to meet their needs .
in this work , we examined federal government efforts to tap the pool of older workers to meet its workforce needs .
to describe demographic trends relating to the retirement eligibility and aging of the federal workforce , we analyzed information on the 24 chief financial officer act ( cfo ) agencies from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) human resource reporting system , the central personnel data file ( cpdf ) .
as with private sector employers , efforts directed at recruiting , engaging , and retaining a diverse workforce , including older workers , may serve to make the federal government a more competitive and productive employer overall .
as the nation's largest employer , the federal government is well positioned to serve as a role model for other employers .
at the same time , the rate of growth for the pool of younger workers is declining , and by 2025 overall labor force growth is expected to be only one - fifth of what it is today and much less than the projected growth in the number of retirees .
in addition , today's older workers are better educated and healthier , and are expected to live longer than previous generations .
many experts maintain that older workers offer competitive advantages to employers because they often possess management and organizational skills that can be used in a variety of settings , and they bring to the job knowledge , experience , and productive work habits .
like the nation's workforce as a whole , the federal workforce is aging and ever larger proportions are nearing retirement eligibility .
some other federal agencies have developed alternative approaches that facilitate hiring and retaining older workers to meet their workforce needs .
older , experienced workers represent a large and underutilized national resource .
when they retire , these older , experienced workers may leave behind critical gaps in leadership , skills , and institutional knowledge .
while there remain opportunities for improvement , opm and the congress are taking action to minimize the challenges agencies face in hiring and retaining older , experienced workers .
