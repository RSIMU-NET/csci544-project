since 2000 , federal suppression expenditures alone have averaged more than $1 billion annually .
in this context of both the increasing size and severity of wildland fires and the rising costs of suppressing fires and protecting federal and nonfederal lands and resources , you asked us to ( 1 ) review how federal and nonfederal entities share the costs of suppressing wildland fires that burn or threaten both of their lands and resources and ( 2 ) identify any concerns federal and nonfederal entities may have with the existing cost - sharing framework .
to address these objectives , we reviewed federal statutes governing cooperative fire protection activities ; federal and interagency wildland fire policies and procedures ; master agreements between federal and nonfederal entities governing cooperative fire protection in 12 western states that frequently experience wildland fires ; and federal , state , and nongovernmental entities' reviews of recent large fires or other reports related to wildland fire suppression costs .
fighting wildland fires — which can burn across federal , state , and local jurisdictions — requires significant investments of firefighting personnel , aircraft , equipment , and supplies , resulting in substantial and increasing fire suppression expenditures .
agreements between cooperating entities , commonly referred to as master agreements , govern these cooperative fire protection efforts and include general provisions for sharing firefighting costs .
according to federal officials , these provisions , and the guidance on available cost - sharing methods , have been changing over the years , in part , to address the continuing expansion of the wildland - urban interface and the resulting increase in nonfederal resources at risk from wildland fire .
in addition , nonfederal entities , such as state and local governments , can spend hundreds of millions of dollars during severe fire years .
firefighting efforts are mobilized through an interagency incident management system , which depends on the close cooperation and coordination of federal , state , tribal , and local fire protection entities .
in addition , as human development continues to expand in or near wildlands — an area commonly known as the wildland - urban interface — wildland fires increasingly threaten not only federal lands and public resources , such as forests and watersheds , but also nonfederal lands and resources , including homes and other structures .
although wildland fires triggered by lightning are a natural , inevitable , and necessary ecological process , past federal fire suppression policies have led to an accumulation of fuels and contributed to larger and more severe wildland fires .
federal and nonfederal firefighting entities share their personnel , equipment , and supplies and work together to fight fires , regardless of which entity has jurisdiction over the burning lands .
at the federal level , five principal agencies are involved in firefighting efforts — the forest service within the department of agriculture and four agencies within the department of the interior .
we also interviewed national , regional , and local firefighting officials from the forest service and department of the interior agencies as well as state officials from arizona , california , colorado , and utah .
in addition , for two recent fires that burned or threatened both federal and nonfederal lands and resources in the 4 states , we reviewed the records listing the firefighting resources deployed , their costs , and the methods chosen to share these costs .
