we assessed ( 1 ) the status of irs's actions to correct or mitigate previously reported information security weaknesses and ( 2 ) whether controls over key financial and tax processing systems are effective in ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information .
effective information system controls are essential for protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information and ensuring that information is adequately protected from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , fraudulent use , improper disclosure , or destruction .
it relies extensively on computerized systems to support its financial and mission - related operations .
in our report on irs's fiscal years 2008 and 2007 financial statements , we reported that the new information security deficiencies we identified in fiscal year 2008 and the unresolved deficiencies from prior audits represent a material weakness in internal controls over financial and tax processing systems .
as part of our audit of irs's fiscal years 2008 and 2007 financial statements , we assessed the effectiveness of the agency's information security controls over key financial systems , information , and interconnected networks at four locations .
these systems support the processing , storage , and transmission of financial and sensitive taxpayer information .
the internal revenue service ( irs ) has a demanding responsibility in collecting taxes , processing tax returns , and enforcing the nation's tax laws .
we conducted this work from april 2008 to january 2009 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
for additional information about our objectives , scope , and methodology , refer to appendix i .
these deficiencies include those related to access controls , as well as other controls such as configuration management and personnel security .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
the financial and taxpayer information on irs systems will remain particularly vulnerable to insider threats until the agency ( 1 ) begins to address and correct prior weaknesses across the service and ( 2 ) fully implements a comprehensive agencywide information security program that ensures risk assessments are appropriately reviewed for all systems , tests and evaluations of controls for systems are comprehensive , and the remedial action process effectively validates corrective actions .
although irs has continued to make progress toward correcting previously reported information security weaknesses at its three data centers , as well as an additional facility , many deficiencies remain .
a key reason for these weaknesses is that irs has not yet fully implemented its agencywide information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively .
in addition , irs has made progress in improving its information security program .
irs corrected weaknesses related to access controls , including physical security , among others .
irs has made progress in correcting or mitigating previously reported weaknesses , implementing controls over key financial systems , and developing and documenting a framework for its agencywide information security program .
a key reason for these weaknesses is that the agency has not yet fully implemented certain key elements of its agencywide information security program .
