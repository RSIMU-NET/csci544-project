osm is charged with enforcing states' adherence to their approved programs or implementing a federal program in accordance with smcra if the state fails to submit , implement , or enforce its own program .
osm has approved programs for 24 states , including kentucky and west virginia in 1982 and 1981 , respectively .
these areas accounted for about 73 percent of appalachia's surface coal production in 2008 .
smcra allows an individual state to develop its own program to implement smcra if that program is in accordance with federal law and is approved by osm .
surface mining of coal is regulated by the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 ( smcra ) , which created the department of the interior's office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement ( osm ) to implement and enforce the act .
despite the public scrutiny that surface mining in mountainous areas has received , the public is limited in its ability to access information on the scope of these operations — their size , location , and how long they have been in operation — and on what the mountain can be expected to look like after mining operations have ceased and the land has been reclaimed .
in response to your request , this report provides information on the characteristics , over time , of ( 1 ) surface coal mining in mountainous areas in kentucky and west virginia and ( 2 ) reclaimed lands disturbed by surface coal mining in mountainous areas in kentucky and west virginia .
although this information is available to the public , the public cannot readily aggregate these data over time to perform trend analyses , which is a key component to understanding the characteristics of surface mining in these states since mining operations can last a decade or more .
the west virginia database is called the environmental resources information system ( eris ) .
this report focuses on surface coal mining in the mountainous areas of kentucky and west virginia because these are the states in which the majority of mountaintop mining that is the source of controversy in appalachia occurs .
however , smis and eris also contain data on these characteristics for prior years , in some cases dating to 1961 .
mountaintop mining operations can involve thousands of acres and take a decade or more to complete .
the kentucky database is called the surface mining information system ( smis ) .
for kentucky , we included in our analysis surface mining permits in the mountainous , eastern part of the state , which accounted for most of the state's surface coal production .
almost all surface mining in appalachia occurs on private land .
surface mining for coal in the mountainous areas of appalachia — often referred to as mountaintop mining — generates controversy due to the scale of mining operations and concern about the post - mining appearance of reclaimed lands , among other issues .
specifically , due to limits on data reliability and to be consistent between the states , we are reporting on the characteristics of surface mining in kentucky and west virginia from january 1990 through july 2008 and on the characteristics of reclaimed lands that were disturbed by surface mining from january 2000 through july 2008 , except for kentucky's data on variances , for which we are reporting from january 2002 through july 2008 .
