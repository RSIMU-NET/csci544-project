u.s. - eu efforts to provide leadership to the world economy in recent years , however , have been affected by a number of trade disputes .
the 108th congress inherits several u.s. - eu disputes where the wto has ruled that u.s. laws violate world trade obligations .
these disputes have absorbed a large amount of timeand energy of key policymakers , making efforts to pursue common interests and objectives , such asthe successful completion of the current wto doha development round , more difficult .
bills were introduced in the 107th congress to comply with some of these wto decisions , but , with the exception of the establishment of a treasury department fund for wto settlements in thetrade act of 2002 , legislation was not acted upon .
the united states and the europeanunion ( eu ) , accounting for over 40% of world trade , are arguably the two most important membersof the wto .

in some cases , barring abolition or significant modification of thestatutes in question , the eu could decide to retaliate against u.s. exports this year or next .
moreover , in cases involving beef hormones , bananas , export tax benefits , and other trade laws,attempts to settle disputes have met with refusal or inability by one side or the other to comply in atimely manner with the wto panel rulings .
other casesin which original wto compliance deadlines passed without needed action by the united statesinclude a dispute over the antidumping act of 1916 , which provides a private right of action andcriminal penalties against dumping ; a copyright dispute where the u.s. was found to have violatedroyalty rights of eu musicians ; and a trademark dispute with implications for a cuban rumtrademark .
at the same time , the eu has not yet complied in a case finding its beef hormonedirective to violate wto obligations , choosing instead to accept retaliatory tariffs originally imposedby the united states in 1999 .
as an international organization intended to ensure that trade between countries flows moreeasily , predictably and freely , the world trade organization ( wto ) serves as a forum forinternational trade negotiations and the settlement of disputes .
