such management includes ( 1 ) monitoring the disability status of all beneficiaries to help ensure program integrity and ( 2 ) helping as many beneficiaries as possible to become self - sufficient by determining their vocational rehabilitation ( vr ) service needs and providing them assistance to enter or reenter the workforce .
ssa is also authorized to conduct cdrs on individuals receiving disability benefits under the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , and recent legislation requires cdrs for some who receive ssi benefits .
together , the programs pay about $60 billion annually to 9 million disabled beneficiaries ; an additional 1.6 million nondisabled dependents of di beneficiaries also receive benefits .
the amounts in cash and medical benefits that beneficiaries can receive by age 65 average about $113,000 for ssi beneficiaries and about $225,000 for di beneficiaries .
programs of this magnitude require sound management to ensure that funds are being spent as the congress intended and to achieve the most effective use of resources .
specifically , we are providing information on ( 1 ) the number and characteristics of individuals who are due for cdrs , ( 2 ) how ssa selects individuals for and conducts cdrs , ( 3 ) whether available resources are adequate for conducting required cdrs , and ( 4 ) what potential options exist for improving the cdr process .
both reports also include information about cases scheduled for cdrs under the ssi program .
we were also asked by the chairman , subcommittee on social security , house committee on ways and means , to provide information about the backlog of cases due for cdrs under the di program .
in recent years , the social security administration ( ssa ) has had difficulty ensuring that people receiving disability benefits under the disability insurance ( di ) program are eligible for benefits .
concerned about ssa's ability to conduct all the cdrs required by law , you asked us to provide information on how to improve the cdr process .
in addition , in a forthcoming report on ssa's review of ssi recipients' disability status , we discuss ssa's strategy for meeting new legislative requirements for cdrs under the ssi program .
to develop this information , we interviewed ssa and state disability determination services officials and members of the national academy of social insurance ( nasi ) disability policy panel .
we also reviewed applicable laws and regulations and relevant ssa documents , including procedures , guidance , work plans , budgets , and cdr costs .
ssa is required by law to conduct periodic examinations , called continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) , to determine whether a beneficiary has medically improved to the extent that the person is no longer considered disabled .
we analyzed extracts from the ssa master beneficiary record ( mbr ) and supplemental security income record description ( ssird ) databases and electronic files provided by the office of disability , which contained information on beneficiaries who were due or overdue for a cdr in fiscal year 1996 .
as agreed with your office , we are providing the same information to you and the chairman , subcommittee on social security , in separate reports .
