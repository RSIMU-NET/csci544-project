some providers contend that medicare's geographic cost adjustments are inadequate .
over time , this could affect some providers' financial stability and their ability or willingness to continue serving medicare patients .
i will focus on ( 1 ) how medicare determines the labor cost adjustment for hospitals in an area ; ( 2 ) whether medicare's labor cost adjustment accounts appropriately for geographic variation in wages paid by hospitals ; ( 3 ) the extent to which geographic reclassification addresses potential problems with medicare's labor cost adjustment for hospitals ; and ( 4 ) how medicare determines geographic adjustments to physician fees .
hospitals that meet certain criteria can qualify to have their payments increased through medicare's reclassification process .
but concerns remain about the geographic variation in payments to hospitals and disparities in hospital financial performance under medicare's hospital payment system .
similarly , physicians have raised concerns about the appropriateness of medicare's geographic adjustment to their fees .
if these adjustments are not adequate , medicare could financially reward or penalize providers due only to where they are located .
yet , some hospitals believe that the labor cost adjustment applied to their payments does not reflect the average wage they face in their labor market area .
medicare's payments to hospitals are intended to vary with the average wages paid in a hospital's labor market .
because medicare's hospital and physician payment systems are based on national rates , these geographic cost adjustments are essential to account for costs beyond providers' control and to ensure that beneficiaries have adequate access to services .
my comments today are based on our forthcoming report on the medicare program's labor cost adjustment for hospital services and our preliminary work on the program's physician payment adjustment .
my comments are based primarily on our analysis of hospital medicare cost report data and other information , including that compiled by the centers for medicare and medicaid services , the agency within the department of health and human services that oversees the medicare program .
geographic reclassification addresses some inequities in medicare's labor cost adjustments by allowing some hospitals that pay wages enough above the average in their area to receive a higher labor cost adjustment .
in summary , medicare's labor cost adjustment does not adequately account for geographic differences in hospital wages in some areas because a single adjustment is applied to all hospitals in an area even though the area may encompass multiple labor markets or different types of communities within which hospitals pay significantly different average wages .
to help ensure that beneficiaries in all parts of the country have access to services , medicare adjustments its physician fee schedule based on indexes designed to reflect cost differences among 92 geographic areas .
i am pleased to be here today as you discuss how the medicare program adjusts payments to hospitals and physicians to account for geographic differences in costs .
we are beginning an analysis of the methodology and data that medicare uses to make the adjustment to determine whether it appropriately reflects underlying costs and , if not , whether beneficiary access to physician services has been impaired in certain areas .
if these payment adjustments do not adequately account for cost differences , hospitals are inappropriately rewarded or face undue fiscal pressure .
