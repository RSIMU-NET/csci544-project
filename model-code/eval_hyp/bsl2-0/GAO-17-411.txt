in a 2015 report , we recommended that , to ensure that hhs workforce efforts meet national needs , hhs should develop a comprehensive and coordinated planning approach to guide its health care workforce development programs .
in making this recommendation we noted that , without such planning , hhs cannot fully identify the gaps between existing programs and national needs as well as the actions needed to address these gaps .
in response , hhs concurred with our recommendation and , among other things , noted that it could convene an interagency group to assess such things as gaps in workforce programs and potential requests to the congress for modified or expanded legislative authority .
as most other federal gme funding comes from medicare , which hhs generally distributes according to statutory formulas unrelated to workforce needs , it is unlikely that other federal funding sources will add the additional primary care positions needed to fill the gap .
in light of the limited nature of current federal efforts to increase primary care gme training , we continue to believe that our recommendation should be implemented and agree that an interagency group like the one proposed by hhs is an important first step toward ensuring a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to workforce planning .
as of december 2016 , hhs officials indicated that the agency had not taken steps to convene this group , but said that it is still considering doing so in the future .
the vast majority of hhs funding is distributed by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , mostly through the medicare program .
when asked the extent to which the efforts might mitigate the shortages , officials said that the efforts could help to lessen them , particularly if the ongoing efforts are fully supported with sustainable , long - term funding .
other , smaller sources of federal gme funding include hhs grants , such as from the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , and from gme training that occurs at department of veterans affairs ( va ) and department of defense medical facilities .
however , officials acknowledged that the efforts account for a small percentage of overall primary care residents being added to the physician workforce .
additionally , medicare gme funding is generally not targeted to specific areas of workforce need , and the number of slots eligible for medicare gme funding was capped at 1996 levels for many hospitals by the balanced budget act of 1997 .
to address physician shortage concerns , the federal government has undertaken some efforts to better target gme funding , including encouraging the training of physicians in rural areas and in primary care specialties .
specifically , in 2014 , the institute of medicine reported that federal funding for gme training totaled more than $15 billion per year , most of which was provided by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
given that these four federal efforts represent a relatively small investment in primary care gme training , and that most other federal funding cannot be targeted to primary care , the efforts may not be sufficient to meet projected primary care physician shortages .
without reauthorization , funding for the teaching health center program will end in fiscal year 2017 .
