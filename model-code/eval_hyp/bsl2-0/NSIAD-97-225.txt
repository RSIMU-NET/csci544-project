ultimately , any decision to change sss would require policy judgments that involve other considerations , some of which cannot be quantified , in addition to cost and time required to respond to a national emergency .
we reviewed the organization and costs of the current program , and agency estimates of the comparative costs and organizational structure changes of the two alternatives .
under this alternative , most of sss' infrastructure would remain intact — including a significant portion of its staff and all of its local , district appeal , civilian review , and national boards .
further , assuming implementation of either of the two alternatives , we obtained estimates on how quickly and at what cost sss could be returned to its present posture and a draft conducted upon mobilization .
this report responds to your requests that we review the selective service system's ( sss ) draft registration program and other selected alternatives .
the “deep standby” alternative would suspend registration , reduce a substantial portion of the workforce , and disband the local , district appeal , civilian review , and national boards .
we reviewed two alternatives , suspending active registration and placing the agency in “deep standby.” a suspended registration alternative would eliminate the current requirement for men between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for a possible military draft .
between 1976 and 1980 , sss operated in a deep standby posture similar to the one detailed above .
those aspects included viewing peacetime registration as ( 1 ) low - cost insurance against unforeseen threats , ( 2 ) a sign to potential adversaries of u.s. resolve , and ( 3 ) a link between the all volunteer military force and society at large .
its missions are to ( 1 ) provide untrained manpower to the department of defense ( dod ) for military service in the event of a national emergency declared by the congress or the president , ( 2 ) administer a program of alternative service for conscientious objectors in the event of a draft , and ( 3 ) maintain the capability to register and forward for induction health care personnel if so directed in a future crisis .
the portions of the $22.9 million 1997 budget that could be most affected by the alternatives total approximately $15.2 million: $7.4 million for the registration program and $7.8 million for operational readiness .
the officials expect that the recovery costs would total about $17.2 million .
sss also commented that our report did not address some aspects of continuing peacetime registration that it characterized as equally important , but less tangible .
sss officials estimate that the current cost to verify registration to ensure compliance with such provisions totals about $1.6 million annually .
sss' 1997 budget is $22,930,000 , which is divided as follows: $7,810,000 for operational readiness ( includes all boards activities ) , $7,360,000 for registration ( includes public awareness activities ) , and $7,760,000 for administration .
sss officials also estimate that revitalizing the agency from a deep standby posture and delivering the first draftees would take about 181 more days than dod's current requirement and would cost about $22.8 million .
