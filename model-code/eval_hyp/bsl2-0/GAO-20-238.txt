this report describes ( 1 ) what is known about the number of abandoned hardrock mines in the united states ; ( 2 ) federal and state agency expenditures to address abandoned hardrock mines from fiscal years 2008 through 2017 , and what is known about future costs to address these mines ; and ( 3 ) factors that limit federal and state agencies' and stakeholders' efforts to address abandoned hardrock mines .
several states also operate programs that identify and address physical safety and environmental hazards at abandoned hardrock mines on both federal and nonfederal lands within their borders .
state officials and stakeholders have been involved in efforts to draft legislation that would address liability concerns , but the interested parties have disagreed about the specific provisions to include .
however , other stakeholders expressed concerns that legislative changes , such as amending cercla or the clean water act , could inadvertently result in weakening the existing environmental protections in these and other laws or could limit the ability of outside parties to enforce their provisions .
in addition , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) administers the superfund program , which addresses risks to human health and the environment associated with abandoned hardrock mines on nonfederal lands , among other things .
since 1999 , several bills have been introduced that would have responded to liability concerns but as of december 2019 , none had been enacted .
interior's office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement ( osmre ) awards grants to states and indian tribes with abandoned hardrock mine programs to conduct portions of this work .
various government agencies and other entities are involved in addressing abandoned hardrock mines .
some stakeholders — including nongovernmental organizations , local citizen groups , and mining companies — participate in projects to address physical safety and environmental hazards at abandoned hardrock mines .
specifically , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) forest service and the department of the interior's bureau of land management ( blm ) and national park service ( park service ) operate programs to address the physical safety and environmental hazards found at abandoned hardrock mines on the approximately 530 million acres of public lands they manage .
we previously reported information on abandoned hardrock mines , including the number of mines and amount of federal agency spending to address these mines .
while federal agency officials did not cite liability concerns as a factor that limits their agencies' efforts to address abandoned hardrock mines on lands under their jurisdictions , forest service , blm , and epa officials concurred that legal liability concerns deter good samaritans from participating in projects with federal agencies at mixed ownership sites .
however , federal agency officials have observed the effects of good samaritan legal liability concerns on projects .
to describe federal and state expenditures and what is known about future costs to address abandoned hardrock mines , we obtained and summarized expenditure information from forest service , blm , park service , epa , and osmre financial systems for fiscal years 2008 through 2017 , the most current at the time of our review .
abandoned mines can also cause environmental degradation and hazardous conditions that may pose risks to human health and the environment , such as draining highly acidic water into soil and streams .
