we reviewed recommendations representing over two - thirds of the $44.3 billion in savings that npr claimed had been achieved from its recommendations to individual federal agencies .
specifically , we examined the savings estimates for two recommendations each from three agencies: the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) .
of the $137 billion in estimated savings , about $44.3 billion was claimed from recommendations that were targeted toward individual agencies .
npr claimed that about $137 billion in savings has resulted from its efforts to reinvent the federal government , including about $34.3 billion in savings that is not expected to be realized until fiscal years 1999 and 2000 .
our objective was to describe and assess how omb estimated savings from selected npr recommendations targeted toward individual agencies .
about $67.5 billion was claimed from recommendations designed to be implemented governmentwide , and another $24.9 billion was claimed from items not originated by npr but , according to npr , were consistent with the principles of reinventing government .
as you requested , this report discusses savings claims from the national performance review , which has been renamed the national partnership for reinventing government ( for both of which we use the acronym npr ) and the methodologies that the office of management and budget ( omb ) used in estimating these claims .
 ( appendixes i through vi contain detailed information on the six recommendations. ) .
as agreed with your office , we did not determine the amount of savings npr should have claimed but rather focused on describing how omb estimated savings from agency - specific recommendations , specifically these six recommendations .
the claims we reviewed at these three agencies constituted about 22 percent of the total estimated savings from npr .
it also included governmentwide recommendations for ( 1 ) reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy , ( 2 ) reducing procurement costs through streamlining , ( 3 ) reengineering processes through the better use of information technology , and ( 4 ) reducing administrative costs .
