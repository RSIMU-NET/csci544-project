how congress and the obama administration respond could have long - term implications for u.s. trade , economic , and foreign policy interests .
trade policy is an important element of economic policy , and as such , its objective is to enhance national economic welfare .
in addition , the rapid increase in capital flows across borders dwarf the impact of flows of goods and services , reducing the effectiveness of trade policy initiatives .
on the other hand , it can be argued that trade policy remains a significant aspect of economic and foreign policy that can hinder or promote national interests and has a high - level of relevance as reflected in the rapid growth of trade ( u.s. trade in goods and services totaled $3.5 trillion in 2009 ) , and the increase in bilateral and regional trade agreements throughout the world .
many of these issues , such as pending free trade agreements and trade negotiations , trade preferences for developing countries , trade enforcement and compliance , and renewal of trade promotion authority , are legacies of previous administrations and congresses .
some observers have suggested that the role of trade policy should be given lower priority relative to foreign policy and domestic economic issues ; others call for an activist policy that faces the challenges head on .
however , what constitutes economic welfare can vary among the interest groups that comprise the stakeholders in u.s. trade policy , such as farmers , manufacturers , service providers , workers , importers , consumers , and environmentalists , and among members of congress who represent them .
this report is designed to assist the 112 th congress as it grapples with these complex issues of trade policy in a rapidly changing economic landscape .
on the one hand , it can be argued that the emergence of global production networks , within which manufacturers have internationalized production processes across borders , is making government - to - government trade agreements and trade policy in general less effective , if not obsolete .
