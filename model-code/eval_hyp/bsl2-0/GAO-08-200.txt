an estimated $1.5 trillion of these assets is managed by u.s. hedge fund advisers .
accordingly , this report ( 1 ) describes how federal financial regulators provide oversight of hedge fund - related activities under their existing authorities ; ( 2 ) examines what measures investors , creditors , and counterparties have taken to impose market discipline on hedge funds ; and ( 3 ) explores the potential for systemic risk from hedge fund - related activities and actions regulators have taken to address this risk .
market discipline plays a primary role , supplemented by indirect regulatory oversight of commercial banks and securities and futures firms , in constraining risk taking and leveraging by hedge fund managers ( advisers ) .
as active market participants , hedge funds generally are recognized to provide benefits to financial markets by enhancing liquidity and promoting market efficiency and price discovery .
we view these initiatives as positive steps taken to address systemic risk .
market participants ( e.g. , investors , creditors , and counterparties ) impose market discipline by rewarding well - managed hedge funds and reducing their exposure to risky , poorly managed hedge funds .
additionally , they are recognized to spur financial innovation and help to reallocate financial risk .
according to industry estimates , from 1998 to early 2007 , the number of funds grew from more than 3,000 to more than 9,000 , and assets under management from more than $200 billion to more than $2 trillion globally .
hedge funds are key players in many financial markets .
nevertheless , the rapid growth of funds that may adopt similar investment strategies in interconnected markets with rapid trading strategies raises questions as to whether large losses from one or more hedge funds could cause widespread difficulties at other firms , in other market segments , or in the financial system as a whole .
institutional investors , such as endowments , foundations , insurance companies , and pension plans , seeking to diversify their risks and increase returns , have invested in hedge funds and contributed to the rapid growth in these funds .
especially in volatile markets , hedge funds are generally willing to assume risks that more regulated financial institutions are unwilling or unable to assume .
for example , hedge funds may impose losses on their creditors and counterparties and thereby disrupt the credit availability to financial markets or through market disruptions that could accompany liquidation of funds' positions .
however , according to several sources , for market discipline to be effective , ( 1 ) investors , creditors , and counterparties must have access to , and act upon , sufficient and timely information to assess a fund's risk profile ; ( 2 ) investors , creditors , and counterparties must have sound risk management policies , procedures , and systems to evaluate and limit their credit risk exposures to hedge funds ; and ( 3 ) creditors and counterparties must increase the costs or decrease the availability of credit to their hedge fund clients as the creditworthiness of the latter changes .
in recent years , hedge funds have grown rapidly .
the subsequent 1999 report by the president's working group on financial markets ( pwg ) questioned the adequacy of ( 1 ) market discipline that some creditors and counterparties ( commercial and investment banks , including their prime brokerage business and futures firms ) imposed on ltcm's risk - taking activities , and ( 2 ) ltcm's disclosure and risk management practices .
