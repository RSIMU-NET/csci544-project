the four departments whose personnel offices we reviewed were the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , the interior ( doi ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) , which together employ roughly one - fourth of the nonpostal federal workforce .
between september 1993 and september 1997 , the number of civilian personnelists across government decreased by about 8,900 employees ( or about 21 percent ) .
in order to gain an understanding of the initial effects of this reduction , we reviewed four major federal departments to ( 1 ) describe the activities they have undertaken in restructuring personnel offices and operations ; ( 2 ) ascertain what , if any , performance measures are in place to gauge results of the restructuring efforts ; and ( 3 ) identify issues agencies may commonly encounter when , in restructuring their personnel operations , they consider outsourcing automated personnel and / or payroll services to another agency or the private sector .
congress has made it clear , through enactment of a statutory framework with the government performance and results act of 1993 as its centerpiece , that it expects agencies to improve their accountability for resources , including human resources , in accomplishing agency missions .
these four departments provide or plan to provide personnel or payroll services to other federal agencies .
we use the term “restructuring” broadly to capture major changes occurring in an organization , including reorganizations , consolidations , downsizing ( reducing the size of the workforce ) , quality improvements , streamlining efforts , the use of new technologies , and reengineering personnel processes , such as the process used to hire employees .
in addition , the national performance review ( npr ) , now called the national partnership for reinventing government , in 1993 , recommended that agencies reduce by half the costs of administrative positions , including personnel positions , by 1999 .
resource reductions and changing missions , coinciding with the replacement of aging human resource management information systems , are driving efforts in federal agencies to restructure their personnel offices .
all four departments took slightly different approaches to streamlining personnel operations and were in the early stages of implementing restructuring plans in late 1997 , when we were completing our work .
in the 1990s , congress constructed a statutory framework to address long - standing weaknesses in federal operations , improve federal management practices , and provide greater accountability for the use of resources and achieving results .
this framework included as its essential elements the government performance and results act of 1993 and key financial management and information technology reform legislation: the chief financial officers act of 1990 — as expanded by the government management reform act of 1994 — and the paperwork reduction act of 1995 and the clinger - cohen act of 1996 , respectively .
npr estimated that these central control positions cost about $35 billion a year in salaries and benefits .
the council's current efforts do not include developing common performance measures .
usda was also responding to 1994 legislation that directed it to reorganize and to reduce its workforce .
npr targeted administrative costs and positions , such as managers , personnel specialists , budget analysts , procurement specialists , and other headquarters staff positions to reduce administrative layers at headquarters and streamline field structures .
