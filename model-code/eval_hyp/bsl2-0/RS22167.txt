the dispute in gonzales v. raich involved a conflict between california's compassionate use act and the federal controlled substances act ( csa ) .
respondents argued that "as applied" to their specific situations the csa exceeded congress's authority under the commerce clause and , therefore , was unconstitutional .
in august 2002 , after federal agents seized and destroyed the respondent's medicinal marijuana plants , suit was brought in the northern district of california seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief against the u.s. attorney general preventing the prosecution of medicinal users pursuant to the csa .
the district court denied the motion , concluding that the respondents could not establish a likelihood of success on the merits .
wickard stands for the proposition that congress can rationally combine the effects that an individual producer has on an interstate market to find substantial impacts on interstate commerce .
initially , the court noted that because the commodities being cultivated in both cases are fungible and that well - established interstate markets exist , both markets are susceptible to fluctuations in supply and demand based on production intended for home - consumption being introduced into the national market .
justice o'connor's dissent focused on the lack of evidence indicating that medicinal marijuana users have a discernable or significant effect on the interstate market which congress sought to regulate .
in reaching its conclusions , the court relied heavily on its 1942 decision in wickard v. filburn , which held that the agricultural adjustment act's federal quota system applied to bushels of wheat that were homegrown and personally consumed .
the court concluded that the csa , unlike the statutes in either lopez ( gun free school zones act ) or morrison ( violence against women act ) , regulated activity that is "quintessentially economic," therefore , neither lopez or morrison cast any doubts on the constitutionality of the statute .
conversely , respondents claimed that the activity at issue in raich is non - commercialâthe respondents had never attempted to sell their marijuanaâand congress had made no finding that the personal cultivation and use of medicinal marijuana has a substantial effect on the interstate marijuana market .
moreover , the court affirmed that "congress was acting well within its authority to 'make all laws which shall be necessary and proper' to 'regulate commerce ... among the several states.' .
the court , however , noted that the standard for assessing the scope of congress's power under the commerce clause , is not whether the activity at issue , when aggregated , substantially affects interstate commerce ; but rather , whether there exists a "rational basis" for congress to have concluded as such .
despite having concluded that under the "rational basis test" congress had acted within its constitutional authority when it enacted the csa and applied it to intrastate possession of marijuana , the court nevertheless had to distinguish lopez and morrison , the court's more recent commerce clause decisions .
according to the court , to carve out medicinal use as a distinct class of activity , as the ninth circuit had done , would effectively make " any federal regulation ( including quality , prescription , or quantity controls ) of any locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for any purpose beyond the 'outer limits' of congress'[s] commerce clause authority. .
