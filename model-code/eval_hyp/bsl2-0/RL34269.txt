the fcc is under judicial mandate to consider how its ownership rules will affect minority ownership of broadcast stations .
on may 5 , 2009 , the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nprm ) seeking comment on methods to improve the agency's data regarding minority and female ownership of broadcast properties .
the new data may be used to aid the fcc in deciding whether and to what extent programs to increase minority and female ownership should be implemented .
also , two bills were introduced in the 110 th congress that would have revived a tax incentive to aid certain businesses seeking to acquire telecommunications , including broadcast , properties .
congress and the federal communications commission ( fcc ) have a history of supporting programs that foster diversity of broadcast station ownership , in general , and minority and female ownership , in particular , as a means to achieve that goal .
the courts have reinforced the notion that minority ownership is a valid concern that should be addressed by the fcc when constructing its media ownership rules , but also have set restrictions on how programs can be structured to foster that goal .
diversity of viewpoint has long been a primary goal of u.s. communications policy .
structuring the programs narrowly may be necessary in order to survive a judicial challenge .
insofar as these proposals define minorities based on race , they will be subject to strict review by the courts .
amidst these concerns , congress repealed irc §1071 .
in adarand , the supreme court declared that any racial classification by government at any level ( state , local , or federal ) must comply with strict scrutiny .
new tax incentives or other broadcast ownership policies that give preference to racial minorities , therefore , would need to withstand close judicial analysis .
the sfnpr contained 14 proposals for the amendment of the fcc's broadcast ownership rules , 10 of which would require a definition for socially disadvantaged businesses ( sdbs ) .
use of the "distress sale" program and other fcc policies that encourage minority ownership of broadcast stations has declined since the supreme court announced its opinion in adarand construction v. peña amidst concerns that the programs , in their current form , could not withstand a legal challenge .
on august 1 , 2007 , the fcc issued a second further notice of proposed rulemaking ( sfnpr ) in its review of the commission's broadcast ownership rules .
strict scrutiny is the most exacting review a court will undertake and requires the government to prove the measure is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest and that the program is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest .
members were also concerned that the short holding period requirement rendered the tax incentive ineffective , because properties could quickly transfer from minority ownership without penalty .
the fcc adopted new rules to promote diversification of broadcast ownership on december 18 , 2007 .
congress expressed concern that the tax certificate program provided little protection from abuse .
the agency is seeking to improve its data on minority and female ownership of broadcast properties by modifying and expanding reporting requirements for broadcasters as well as improving the agency's database .
