to implement these efforts , tsa funding for aviation security has totaled about $26 billion since fiscal year 2004 .
in carrying out its broader homeland security responsibilities , dhs faces the daunting challenge of determining how to allocate its finite resources within the aviation system and across all sectors to address threats and strengthen security .
our testimony today focuses on tsa's efforts to ensure the security of the following key areas of the commercial aviation system , which represents about $4.5 billion of the $6.0 billion president's fiscal year 2009 budget request for aviation security: 1 ) screening operations , including transportation security officer ( tso ) and private screener allocations , and checkpoint screening technologies ; 2 ) air cargo ; and 3 ) and passenger watch - list matching .
since its inception , tsa has focused much of its efforts on aviation security , and has developed and implemented a variety of programs and procedures to secure commercial aviation .
other parties also play a role in securing commercial aviation , including air carriers that are responsible for screening air cargo , among other things , and the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) science and technology directorate ( s&t ) , which is responsible for the research and development of aviation security technologies .
in particular , we will address the numerous efforts tsa has taken or plans to take to strengthen security in these areas and the challenges that remain .
this statement will address the following issues raised by the mandate: ( 1 ) overall progress made in strengthening the secure flight program , including privacy protection issues and coordination of international and domestic watch - list matching functions , ( 2 ) development of secure flight's cost and schedule estimates , ( 3 ) efforts made in secure flight's system development including risk management , end - to - end testing , and information security , and ( 4 ) dhs and tsa's efforts to evaluate redress .
the transportation security administration ( tsa ) was established in 2001 with the mission to protect the transportation network while also ensuring the free movement of people and commerce .
