a concerted effort toward aid coordination would likely result in higher levels of ida funding .
if other donors are not in broad support of the u.s. aid agenda , the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid through the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) or another u.s. agency .
for example , some point out that the current international focus on combating hiv / aids and other infectious diseases may have implications for cost of service of other health - care programs , drugs , and availability of resources , in addition to a possible brain - drain as doctors and medical professionals switch focus to work for programs with a higher profile and greater availability of funding .
the lack of coordination of donors on the one hand , and the increasing restrictions on projects themselves through donor earmarks and time limits on the other , have raised the cost and difficulty for implementing foreign aid .
in addition to the aid fragmentation problem discussed earlier , it is believed by many that multilateral aid is more effective since it is likely to be better insulated from political pressure than bilateral assistance .
on the other hand , some analysts raise concerns that the united states loses too much control over the provision of its aid with a multilateral approach .
second , since the united states does not have veto power on world bank lending , the bank sometimes provides assistance to countries despite strong u.s. opposition .
the declaration was prompted by concerns that aid is ineffective under the current structure .
it is also the first replenishment since the 2005 paris declaration on aid harmonization , in which ida and over 100 other signatories agreed to increase coordination among donors in an effort to raise aid effectiveness .
analysts in the united states and in other donor countries actively debate the pros and cons of providing foreign assistance through multilateral organizations rather than solely on a bilateral basis .
in these cases , the world bank often plays an important role by focusing on a country's overall development needs , through their country assistance strategies , and continuing to provide assistance to all sectors of a country's economy .
furthermore , some analysts argue that a major benefit of the world bank's multilateral assistance is that the bank is not directly subject to the often shifting priorities of individual donor nations and is thus able to focus on long - term multi - sectoral development assistance .
higher levels of debt relief will lead to lower levels of ida assistance unless donors increase their contributions significantly over the next several years , according to bank economists and outside experts .
the bank asserts that without additional compensation from donors and an increase in regular contributions , ida's future commitments would remain flat in nominal terms , and decrease by 2% per year in real terms .
recipients can be overwhelmed by requirements for multiple project audits , environmental assessments , procurement reports , financial statements , and project updates. .
some argue that by forgiving the repayment of debt owed to ida , the bank has substantially reduced the amount of money it has to fund new operations .
