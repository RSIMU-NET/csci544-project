the taliban government ( 1996-2001 ) opposed modernization , but there has been substantial modernization and urbanization since the taliban were ousted — changes that might help afghanistan remain stable after the international involvement in afghanistan ends .
ethnic and rural communities , many of which are divided by mountains and wide expanses , have often looked to local faction leaders for their governance .
u.s. and international partner policy has been to try to empower these groups to check government power and to entrench afghan democracy .
organizations and groups addressing various issues , including women's rights , law and justice , media freedoms , economics and business issues , the environment , and others , have proliferated .
afghanistan's governing structure has historically consisted of a weak central government unwilling or unable to enforce significant financial or administrative mandates on all of afghanistan's diverse ethnic communities or on the 80% of afghans who live in rural areas .
at the national level , afghanistan had few , if any , western - style democratic institutions prior to the international intervention that took place after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
these structures governed and secured afghanistan until the late 1970s but were weakened by decades of subsequent war and taliban rule .
some local leaders have chosen to accommodate local insurgents rather than help the government secure their areas .
these newly emerging interest groups have still not been able to displace — or even necessarily substantially influence — the informal power structure of ethnic , regional , tribal , clan , village , and district structures that exercise authority at all levels .
at the same time , there has always been a struggle between urban , educated "modernizers" and the rural , lesser - educated traditionalists who adhere to a set of long - standing customs and practices .
some traditional local authority figures fled or were killed ; others were displaced by mujahedin commanders , militia leaders , taliban militants , and others .
the elected institutions and the 2004 adoption of a constitution were part of a post - taliban transition roadmap established by a united nations - sponsored agreement of major afghan factions signed in bonn , germany , on december 5 , 2001 ( "bonn agreement" ) , after the taliban had fallen .
local power brokers are widely accused of selectively applying afghan law and of using their authority to enrich themselves and their supporters .
the parliament was suspended outright following the april 1978 communist seizure of power .
under the constitution of 1964 , king zahir shah was to be a constitutional monarch , and an elected lower house and appointed upper house were set up .
since the fall of the taliban , there has also been the growth of a civil society , largely made up of educated afghans , many of whom returned to afghanistan from exile when the taliban fell .
the parliament during that era never succeeded in becoming a significant check on the king's power , although the period from 1964 until the seizure of power by mohammad daoud in a 1973 military coup was considered a flowering of afghan democracy .
