these factors include price , technical capability , environmental concerns , and political considerations .
numerous bills have been introduced in both houses .
in 2016 , the united states started exporting liquefied natural gas ( lng ) from the lower 48 states .
this report highlights key aspects of global natural gas markets , including supply and demand , and major u.s. developments .
both the house and the senate have held multiple hearings related to natural gas .
several key factors will determine whether significant new quantities of natural gas come to market , particularly unconventional natural gas resources .
many countries , both producing and consuming , are watching how the development of u.s. unconventional natural gas resources evolves .
this has spurred other countries to try to develop shale gas , but progress is slow outside of north america .
in recent years , the united states has become the home to the shale gas revolution , as improved methods to extract natural gas from certain shale formations have significantly increased the resource profile of the united states .
the role of natural gas in the u.s. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in the 114 th congress .
fugitive emissions , which can be intentional ( i.e. , vented ) or unintentional ( i.e. , leaked ) , are natural gas that is released to the atmosphere during industry operations .
natural gas combustion also emits less particulate matter , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen oxides than coal or oil .
if the united states continues to and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market at a competitive price , then natural gas could play a larger role in the world's economy .
natural gas combustion emits about one - half less carbon dioxide than coal and one - quarter less than oil when consumed in a typical electric power plant , offset somewhat by fugitive emissions .
some consider natural gas a potential bridge fuel to a lower - carbon economy , because it is cleaner burning than coal and oil .
select statutes of u.s. law related to natural gas can be found in appendix g .
this change will require 85% less energy to generate future chinese growth ; consequently , predictions are uncertain regarding china's future in energy consumption .
however , meeting india's energy demand may prove to be a huge financial commitment â€” nearly $2.8 trillion .
natural gas production would likely need to increase to meet the rise in demand and keep prices from dramatically rising .
sectorally , the u.s. electric power industry leads the growth in natural gas demand due to several factors , including relatively low prices , lower capital costs , excess natural gas generation capacity , and competitive financing of projects .
global natural gas consumption ( 2015 ) appendix b .
government policies , particularly in regard to carbon dioxide emissions , will be a key factor in determining the rate of growth of natural gas usage .
natural gas comprises about 6% of india's primary energy supply , and is projected to make up less than 10% of india's energy mix in 2040 .
