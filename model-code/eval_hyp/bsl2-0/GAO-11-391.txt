in addition , questions have been raised regarding the adequacy of va's oversight of vamcs' compliance with these requirements .
in response , a congressional committee and certain members of congress have raised questions about the adequacy of va's requirements for purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing to help ensure veterans' safety .
in this report , we examine ( 1 ) va purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements in va policies , which were selected based on their relevance to patient safety incidents , and ( 2 ) va's oversight of vamcs' compliance with these selected requirements .
we reported examples of noncompliance with va's requirements for purchasing and tracking certain medical supplies and equipment , which may pose risks to veterans' safety .
organized into 21 veterans integrated service networks ( visn ) , va's health care system includes 153 va medical centers ( vamc ) nationwide that offer a variety of outpatient , residential , and inpatient services .
to examine va's oversight of vamcs' compliance with the purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements we selected , we reviewed va's oversight of these requirements and evaluated whether this oversight provides va with adequate information to identify and address noncompliance .
recent press articles have reported lapses in compliance with va's reprocessing requirements at some va medical centers , which may have put the safety of thousands of veterans receiving care at these facilities at risk .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates one of the largest integrated health care delivery systems in the united states , providing care to over 5.5 million veterans annually .
as part of this review , we assessed va's oversight in the context of federal standards for internal control for monitoring .
va has established requirements for vamcs to follow for purchasing items such as expendable medical supplies and rme ; for tracking — that is , accounting for — these items at their facilities ; and for reprocessing rme .
we also interviewed vamc officials who were responsible for implementing the selected requirements in va policies to determine whether the selected requirements are adequate to help ensure veterans' safety .
moreover , in a september 2010 congressional hearing , we presented our preliminary observations on veterans' safety issues related to expendable medical supplies and rme .
these policies are designed , in part , to help ensure the safety of the veterans who receive care at vamcs .
the internal control for monitoring refers to an agency's ability to assure that ongoing review and supervision activities are conducted , with the scope and frequency depending on the assessment of risks ; deficiencies are communicated to at least one higher level of management ; and actions are taken in response to findings or recommendations within established timelines .
to examine va purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements , we reviewed relevant va policies , and from these policies we judgmentally selected two purchasing requirements , two tracking requirements , and two reprocessing requirements that we determined were relevant to patient safety incidents that were identified at certain vamcs .
in providing health care services to veterans , clinicians at vamcs use supplies and equipment purchased by va .
