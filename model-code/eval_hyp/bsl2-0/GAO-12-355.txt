different stakeholders — government agencies and health care providers — will likely continue to have differing perspectives about the optimal balance between innovative approaches to improve quality and lower costs and retaining appropriate patient and program safeguards .
our work suggests that stakeholders' concerns may hinder implementation of financial incentive programs to improve quality and efficiency on a broad scale .
medicare spending , which represents a large share of federal health care expenditures , is projected to increase from approximately $519 billion in 2010 to approximately $922 billion in 2020 .
for many years the united states has devoted an increasing proportion of its gross domestic product ( gdp ) and federal budget to the provision of health care services .
these federal laws were designed to protect patients and the integrity of federal health care programs , including medicare .
over this same period , the proportion of federal budget outlays devoted to health care increased even more rapidly from approximately 8.3 to 26.9 percent .
health systems that implement other financial incentive programs must comply with various federal laws in their efforts to reward quality and efficiency .
the medicare payment advisory commission , institute of medicine ( iom ) , and other experts have recommended that payments for health care should contain stronger incentives for quality and efficiency .
under the medicare shared savings program , which is a permanent program , cms and oig will waive fraud and abuse laws for financial incentive programs under certain circumstances , but there may be limits on health systems' ability to participate .
we have long expressed concern that the increases in medicare spending are unsustainable , especially in light of evidence that suggests that greater spending does not necessarily translate to better health care quality .
among other things , these laws limit health systems that deliver care to medicare beneficiaries from implementing financial incentive programs that could , for example , influence providers to recommend medically inappropriate services or withhold costly services that are medically necessary .
while the federal government examines various reforms to payment mechanisms , some health systems are implementing financial incentive programs to promote the quality and efficiency of care by rewarding physicians for meeting quality benchmarks and improving efficiency .
our report examines ( 1 ) how federal fraud and abuse laws , regulations , and guidance affect the implementation of financial incentive programs , and the perspectives of stakeholders on their ability to implement such programs ; and ( 2 ) alternative approaches to the federal fraud and abuse laws through which hhs has approved certain financial incentive programs .
congress has included various reforms in the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , including those that align incentives for hospitals and physicians to improve health care quality and efficiency in conjunction with efforts to develop collaborative care models for the medicare program .
cms's various demonstrations , the medicare shared savings program , and programs implemented by the innovation center provide other opportunities for some health systems to implement these programs without the associated challenges of conforming to some of the federal fraud and abuse laws .
federal agencies with oversight and enforcement responsibilities under these laws — including the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and the office of inspector general ( oig ) within hhs — have issued regulations and guidance regarding financial incentive programs , while guarding against patient and program abuse .
