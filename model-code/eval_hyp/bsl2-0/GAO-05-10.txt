 ( 2 ) have the navy's experiences with rotational crewing been effectively implemented ? .
 ( 3 ) how does ship maintenance affect implementation of rotational crewing ? .
recently , senior navy officials have also cited crew rotations as one of the ways to partially mitigate the need for a larger force structure and free billions of dollars for higher priority areas , such as the capabilities needed to operate from the sea when the united states is denied access to bases and ports abroad .
recognizing the navy's need to explore ways for improving the use of its surface ships and its plan for employing rotational crews on several types of surface ships in the current and planned force ( appendix i provides a description of all ships included in our evaluation ) , this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) has the navy systematically evaluated the feasibility , including the cost - effectiveness , of rotational crewing concepts for existing and future classes of surface ships ? .
the navy has rotated crews on ships in several ways , although its use of this practice is not widespread and is still evolving .
as such , it is prudent for the navy to employ its ships in a manner that maximizes its return on investment .
the navy is also facing an affordability challenge as it invests in new ships , supports a high pace of operations , and manages rising personnel costs .
the strategy also notes that keeping an overseas presence serves to assure u.s. allies ; improves the ability to prosecute the global war on terrorism ; deters , dissuades , and defeats other threats ; and supports transformation .
maintaining an overseas military presence that is prepared to deter threats and engage enemies remains an enduring tenet of u.s. national military strategy and priorities .
to assess whether the navy has systematically evaluated the feasibility and cost - effectiveness of rotational crewing concepts for existing and future classes of surface ships , we reviewed rotational crewing studies performed by and for the navy , including a recent study by the center for naval analyses ; compiled and analyzed sailor reenlistment data ; interviewed department of defense ( dod ) and navy headquarters and fleet officials ; met with cost analysis experts in the government and the private sector ; and reviewed key acquisition documents and crew employment plans .
we prepared this report under our oversight authority and are providing it to you because of your oversight on defense issues .
rotating crews aboard ships so that the ships can remain deployed for a longer period is one of many alternatives the navy could pursue to increase the utilization or the operational on - station days , or both , of navy ships .
the navy has traditionally maintained overseas presence by using standard deployments whereby individual ships and their permanently assigned crews are deployed for approximately 6 months out of a 27-month cycle that includes time for training and ship maintenance .
the chief of naval operations earlier this year underscored the continuing importance of forward - deployed forces , noting â€œour forward rotations remain critically important to our security , to strengthening alliances and coalitions , and to the global war on terrorism .
