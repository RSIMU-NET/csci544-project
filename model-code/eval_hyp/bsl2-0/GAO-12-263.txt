the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 mandated that we review dod's use of the national security exception .
the mandate required us to review ( 1 ) the pattern of usage of such exception by acquisition organizations within the department to determine which organizations are commonly using the exception and the frequency of such usage ; ( 2 ) the range of items or services being acquired through the use of such exception ; ( 3 ) the process for reviewing and approving justifications involving such exception ; ( 4 ) whether the justifications for use of such exception typically meet the requirements of the far applicable to the use of such exception ; ( 5 ) issues associated with follow - on procurements for items or services acquired using such exception ; and ( 6 ) potential additional instances where such exception could be applied and any authorities available to the department other than such exception that could be applied in such instances .
dod's better buying power initiative , launched in september 2010 , recognized that dod has not taken full advantage of opportunities for competition to achieve the best possible return on its investments .
to answer the mandate , we ( 1 ) identified the pattern of dod's use of the national security exception to full and open competition , including the range of goods and services acquired ; ( 2 ) assessed dod's process for using this exception ; and ( 3 ) determined the extent to which dod obtained competition on selected contracts when using the national security exception .
the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) requires , with limited exceptions , that contracting officers promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding contracts .
the department of defense ( dod ) spent an average of $370 billion per year buying goods and services during fiscal years 2007 through 2010 .
one exception — the national security exception — allows agencies to limit potential offerors on a contract solicitation in instances when disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise national security , but still requires agencies to request offers from as many potential sources as practicable .
to determine dod's pattern of use of the national security exception , we analyzed data from the federal procurement data system – next generation ( fpds - ng ) for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 , and obtained data on competition and use of this exception from the dod intelligence agencies .
furthermore , we analyzed policies and guidance , federal procurement data , and met with dod officials at the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) , the three military departments , and four dod intelligence agencies .
in addition , we reviewed five contracts provided by dod intelligence agencies , for a total of 32 contracts across dod as a whole.we did not include other dod entities in our sample that reported little or no use of the exception in federal procurement data .
we determined that the federal procurement data for these fiscal years were sufficiently reliable to identify dod's use of the national security exception , in part by verifying a non - generalizable random sample of the data from the army , navy , and air force ( referred to throughout this report as the military departments ) .
