the social security administration ( ssa ) manages two of the largest federal disability benefit programs — social security disability insurance and supplemental security income — which together resulted in payments of more than $165 billion to about 13.5 million people with disabilities and their families in fiscal year 2010 .
you recently asked us to assess ssa's plans and efforts for revising its disability criteria .
to perform this work , we reviewed our prior reports and ssa office of inspector general reports ; relevant federal laws and regulations ; program documentation , including policies , procedures , strategic goals , and supporting project plans and cost estimates ; relevant literature ; and position papers and testimonies from disability groups and commissions .
we interviewed ssa officials , key project contractors and stakeholders , disability experts , and representatives of other agencies that administer disability programs .
given the extensive size and cost of its disability programs , ssa must have current and appropriate criteria by which to assess whether an applicant's medical conditions affect his or her ability to perform work in the national economy .
accordingly , we examined the status and management of ssa's efforts to update its medical listings to reflect current medical knowledge and develop a new occupational information system to reflect labor market changes , and we identified other steps taken by ssa to incorporate a modern view of disability into its eligibility criteria .
moreover , we and others have found ssa's disability programs — which historically have tended to equate severity of a medical condition with an inability to work — to be out of sync with a more modern concept of disability that considers the presence or lack of assistance that an individual with medical impairments might need to function more effectively in his or her environment .
however , we designated federal disability programs as high risk , in part because the medical criteria and occupational information that ssa relies on to make benefit decisions were found to be out of date .
we also evaluated ssa's plans to update its criteria against sound project management and cost estimating practices .
we narrowed our scope to criteria used for initial adult disability determinations .
ssa administers two disability programs: the social security disability insurance ( di ) program , enacted in 1956 , and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , enacted in 1972 .
see appendix i for more on our scope and methodology .
we conducted this performance audit from april 2011 through june 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
ssa has made progress , but continues to face delays in completing both comprehensive and ongoing targeted updates .
1 ) .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
however , especially in an era of governmentwide fiscal constraints , success of its ois may hinge on ssa prioritizing its analysis of risks and feasible alternatives to address potential funding shortfalls and other significant challenges .
for example , ssa has already extended the expiration date for its targeted review of the cardiovascular system .
