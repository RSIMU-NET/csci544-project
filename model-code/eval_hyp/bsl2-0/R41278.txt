it also reauthorized funding for many existing discretionary grant programs .
funding for all these discretionary programs , both new and existing , is subject to action by congressional appropriators .
the costs of expanding public and private health insurance coverage and other spending are offset by revenues from new taxes and fees , and by savings from payment and health care delivery system reforms designed to slow the growth in spending on medicare and other federal health care programs .
implementing aca also is likely to affect discretionary spending , which is provided in and controlled by annual appropriations acts .
while the authorizations of appropriations for most of these existing programs expired prior to aca's enactment , typically they continued to receive an annual appropriation .
aca also includes numerous mandatory appropriations that provide billions of dollars to fund temporary programs to increase access and funding for targeted groups , provide funding to states to plan and establish exchanges , and support many other research and demonstration programs and activities .
the law established numerous new discretionary grant programs and provided for each an authorization of appropriations .
aca is projected to have a significant impact on federal direct spending and revenues .
medicaid law allows the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) to withhold existing federal medicaid matching funds if states refuse to comply with the expansion .
the law includes direct spending to subsidize the purchase of health insurance coverage through the exchanges , as well as increased outlays for the expansion of state medicaid programs .
in addition to changes to private insurance and these federal health programs , aca includes numerous provisions intended to increase the primary care and public health workforce , promote preventive services , and strengthen quality measurement , among other things .
aca also amends the medicare program in an effort to reduce the rate of its projected growth ; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans found to have high premiums ; and makes many other changes to the tax code , medicare , medicaid , and the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) .
in addition to expanding private health insurance coverage , aca requires state medicaid programs to expand coverage to all eligible nonelderly , non - pregnant individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level ( fpl ) .
under aca , the federal government will initially cover 100% of the expansion costs , phasing down to 90% of the costs by 2020 .
however , in national federation of independent business v. sebelius , the u.s. supreme court found that the medicaid expansion violated the constitution by threatening states with the loss of their existing federal medicaid matching funds .
on march 23 , 2010 , president obama signed into law a comprehensive health reform law , the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) .
the court precluded the hhs secretary from penalizing states that choose not to participate in the medicaid expansion ( see text box ) .
the following week , on march 30 , 2010 , the president signed the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 ( hcera ) , which amended numerous health care and revenue provisions in aca .
