officials identified three key federal grant programs .
to describe the prevalence and use of federal grants to train or fund sexual assault forensic examiners , we asked officials at doj and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to identify and describe federal grant programs from which funds are available for these purposes .
the violence against women act ( vawa ) , most recently reauthorized in 2013 , authorized funding for federal grant programs administered by the department of justice ( doj ) that can be used by states and other eligible entities to , among other things , train sexual assault forensic examiners or fund examiner positions .
we reviewed relevant laws as well as doj guidance and reports related to the three grant programs and to sexual assault forensic exams and examiners .
however , concerns have been raised about the availability of examiners to meet victims' needs for exams .
this report describes: 1. the prevalence and use of federal grants to train and fund sexual 2. what is known about the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners nationally and in selected states ; and 3. the challenges selected states face in maintaining a supply of sexual assault forensic examiners .
we also analyzed data submitted to doj by grantees of these three programs .
we also reviewed grantees' open - ended responses to questions on grantee progress reporting forms about the status of achieving their grant goals and objectives , reported effectiveness of and other information about their training activities , and grantee perceptions about the most significant areas of remaining need with regard to training or funding examiners .
you asked us to review sexual assault victims' access to health care facilities with medical providers trained in conducting sexual assault forensic examinations .
to select the six states ( colorado , florida , massachusetts , nebraska , oregon , and wisconsin ) , we considered the number of grantees in each state that received funding from any of the three grant programs ; whether states had unique policies or programs in place regarding the training of examiners ; and state population size and geographic location .
studies have shown that exams performed by trained sexual assault forensic examiners may result in shortened exam time , better quality health care delivered to victims , higher quality forensic evidence collection , as well as better collaboration with the legal system and higher prosecution rates .
we interviewed experts , such as officials from the international association of forensic nurses ( iafn ) , about the availability of federal grant funding to train or fund examiners .
we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes of describing the prevalence and use of federal grants to train or fund examiners .
specifically , we analyzed data on the number of grantees that used funds to provide training for or fund examiner positions as well as the number of examiners who received training or examiner positions funded in 2013 and , where available , 2014 .
in the six selected states , we interviewed a total of nine grantees that received federal funds in fiscal year 2014 .
we restricted our review of open - ended responses to those that mentioned terms related to sexual assault forensic examiners .
