despite the controversy surrounding osha's draft standard , some employers have taken the initiative to address msds through the implementation of ergonomics programs .
the congress has enacted a modified restriction for fiscal year 1998 that prohibits osha from issuing a proposed or final ergonomics standard during the year , but allows osha to develop such a proposal in the meantime .
between july 1995 and october 1996 , a restriction in an appropriations law prohibited osha from spending appropriated funds to do further work to develop a draft standard .
the department of labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) has estimated that as much as one - third of these costs is due to musculoskeletal disorders ( msd ) , a wide range of illnesses and injuries related to repetitive stress or sustained exertion on the body .
to learn about these programs and their results , you asked that we ( 1 ) identify the core elements of effective ergonomics programs and describe how these elements are operationalized at the facility level , ( 2 ) discuss whether these programs have proven beneficial to the employers and employees that have implemented them , and ( 3 ) highlight the implications of these employers' experiences for other employers and osha .
others , including labor organizations , generally supported the draft standard and believed it was consistent with approaches implemented by many employers .
over the last few years , osha has tried to develop a workplace standard requiring employers to take particular actions to reduce msds and the contributing workplace hazards ( often called ergonomic hazards ) .
a draft standard that osha circulated for informal comment in 1995 generated significant opposition from many employers because they believed it required an unreasonable level of effort to identify jobs with ergonomic hazards and to reduce these hazards .
but there is disagreement about what workplace conditions cause or contribute to msd and what actions employers should take to reduce msds .
private sector employers spend about $60 billion annually on workers' compensation costs associated with injuries and illnesses experienced by their employees .
to identify the core elements of effective ergonomics programs , we conducted a literature review and interviewed experts in the business , labor , and academic communities with experience in implementing such programs or expertise in the field of ergonomics .
to learn how the elements of ergonomics programs have been operationalized at the facility level and determine whether these programs have proven beneficial , we conducted case studies at selected facilities of five employers , interviewing pertinent program officials and obtaining program and results data ( app .
to explore the implications of our findings for other employers and osha , we interviewed pertinent officials and obtained information about current activities from osha and selected states that operate their own osha programs about how employers and employees can be encouraged to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of msds .
table 1 shows the employers and facilities selected , their product or service , and their staffing level .
we explored the extent to which these activities responded to employers' needs as reflected through the experiences of our case study employers .
we also convened several panels comprising representatives from the business , labor , and academic communities to obtain their views on the implications of our findings .
