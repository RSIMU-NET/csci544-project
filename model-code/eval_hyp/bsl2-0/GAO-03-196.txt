many employer - sponsored health plans and insurers contract with pharmacy benefit managers ( pbms ) to help manage their prescription drug benefits .
pbms negotiate drug prices with pharmacies and drug manufacturers on behalf of health plans and , in addition to other administrative , clinical , and cost containment services , process drug claims for the health plans .
most federal employees , retirees , and their dependents participating in the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) , the largest employer - sponsored health insurance program in the united states , are enrolled in plans that contract with pbms to manage their prescription drug benefits .
in 2001 , total employer health benefit costs rose 11 percent , while prescription drug costs rose 17 percent .
the increasing cost of prescription drugs has been a key component of rising employer health care costs in recent years .
in 2001 , nearly 200 million americans had their prescription drug benefits managed by a pbm .
how do fehbp plans' use of pbms affect enrollees , including access to prescription drugs and out - of - pocket spending ? .
opm , fehbp plans , and pbms must balance these trade - offs in designing affordable and accessible prescription drug benefits for federal employees .
because pbms play a critical role in managing prescription drug benefits , you asked us to examine pbms' role within the fehbp program .
2 .
however , attempts to achieve additional cost savings can involve trade - offs for plan enrollees .
how do fehbp plans' use of pbms affect retail pharmacies , including pharmacies' reimbursements for drugs dispensed and administrative requirements ? .
manufacturers may pay higher rebates when formularies have stronger incentives to use specific drugs .
therefore , pbms may be able to provide other health plans with higher rebates if their formularies are more restrictive than those of the fehbp plans we examined .
do pbms achieve savings , and , if so , how ? .
3 .
for example , additional savings through formulary management can accrue if more restrictive formularies are used , but enrollees would likely have unrestricted access to fewer drugs .
how are pbms compensated for services provided to fehbp plans ? .
smaller networks have the potential to draw more enrollees into participating stores but offer enrollees access to fewer retail pharmacies .
geha contracted with medco health solutions and pacificare of california contracted with prescription solutions , another subsidiary of pacificare health systems .
rebates and formularies are interrelated .
to respond to these questions , we examined the use of pbms by three fehbp plans: blue cross and blue shield ( bcbs ) , government employees hospital association ( geha ) , and pacificare of california .
formulary incentives , such as lower enrollee cost sharing for certain drugs compared to competing therapeutically equivalent drugs , encourage the former's use .
in particular , we addressed the following questions: 1 .
pbms achieved savings for fehbp plans primarily by obtaining price discounts for drugs , obtaining rebate payments from manufacturers , and employing various intervention techniques to control drug utilization and cost .
in addition , we obtained plan and pbm data on drug manufacturers' rebates that pbms pass on to plans and any estimated savings resulting from certain pbm intervention techniques such as drug utilization reviews and prior authorization .
