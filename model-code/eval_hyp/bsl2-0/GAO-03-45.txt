as agreed with your office , we assessed the extent to which ( 1 ) osha's worksite - specific targeting processes ensure that osha effectively identifies hazardous worksites , ( 2 ) the agency's measurement efforts allow it to accurately demonstrate its impact on workplace safety , and ( 3 ) its human capital efforts to enhance inspector quality are likely to improve enforcement .
for example , while osha enforces safety and health regulations in 31 “federal osha states,” it has delegated its enforcement authority to protect workplace safety and health to 23 “state - plan states,” where state agencies have assumed responsibility for establishing their own goals and enforcing safety and health regulations .
as with many other organizations , osha seeks to ensure that it ( 1 ) focuses its limited resources on those workplaces most likely to cause worker injury , illness , or death ; ( 2 ) shows that its efforts make worksites safer ; and ( 3 ) has a highly trained workforce capable of carrying out its mission effectively .
osha's efforts to address these challenges are made more difficult by the fact that it shares responsibility for workplace safety and health with numerous other entities .
although workplace fatality and injury rates have improved significantly over the last decade , the department of labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) continues to strive to reduce work - related injuries , illnesses , and fatalities for the country's 120 million workers .
we also reviewed with experts osha's procedures and methods to measure its efforts on workplace safety and health .
we then obtained and analyzed relevant historical data from ( 1 ) the department of labor's bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) on workplace injuries , illnesses , and fatalities ; ( 2 ) osha's integrated management information system ( imis ) inspection database , which compiles activity information on worksite inspections conducted by osha ; and ( 3 ) the osha data initiative ( odi ) database , through which osha targets specific worksites for priority inspection .
our work focused on the inspection and enforcement activities within the federal osha states .
to address the first two objectives , we identified the procedures and data osha used to develop its targets and measure its results .
in carrying out this mission , osha faces a number of challenges .
we also reviewed its plans for providing training to its inspection staff and assessed whether osha has in place the policy directives and database systems needed to ensure the success of these efforts .
for the third objective , we reviewed osha's recent efforts to restructure its local offices .
since the early 1990s , over 50,000 u.s. workers have lost their lives in workplace accidents .
we obtained osha personnel's views on these efforts through interviews with officials at 9 of the 10 osha regional offices and 17 of osha's 85 area offices .
for all objectives , we interviewed osha and other department of labor officials .
several weaknesses in osha's measurement efforts affected its ability to accurately demonstrate its impact on workplace safety .
moreover , the methods osha used to measure its progress may have misstated its accomplishments .
