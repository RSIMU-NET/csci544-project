no overall strategy integrates the threat - reduction and nonproliferation programs of the department of defense ( dod ) , department of energy ( doe ) , and others , and the agencies' implementation of very similar programs has not always been well coordinated .
another significant barrier to interagency collaboration is agencies' concerns about protecting jurisdiction over missions and control over resources .
taking into account the nation's long - range fiscal challenges , the federal government must identify ways to deliver results more efficiently and in a way that is consistent with its multiple demands and limited resources .

according to dod and doe officials managing these programs , agencies' roles are not well delineated and coordination could be improved .
instead , federal agencies carry out programs in a fragmented , uncoordinated way , resulting in a patchwork of programs that can waste scarce funds , confuse and frustrate program customers , and limit the overall effectiveness of the federal effort .
from combating terrorism , monitoring infectious diseases , and responding to natural disasters , the federal government faces a series of challenges in the 21st century that will be difficult , if not impossible , for any single agency to address alone .
one such barrier stems from missions that are not mutually reinforcing or that may even conflict , making reaching a consensus on strategies and priorities difficult .
in particular , there is no governmentwide guidance delineating the roles and responsibilities of agencies managing border security programs .
although achieving results may involve the collaborative efforts of both federal and nonfederal partners , for the purpose of this work we focused on the practices that federal agencies can employ .
finally , interagency collaboration is often hindered by incompatible procedures , processes , data , and computer systems .
we also identified areas where federal agencies are engaged in collaborative efforts .
achieving results for the nation increasingly requires that federal agencies work together .
we also considered our prior work on how the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) can be used to identify opportunities for improved collaboration among federal agencies and on the role played by the office of management and budget ( omb ) — as the focal point for overall management in the executive branch agencies — in providing leadership and direction to federal agencies' collaborative efforts .
to help agencies overcome these barriers , and in response to your request , this report identifies key practices that can help enhance and sustain federal agency collaboration , along with illustrative examples from select agencies .
we have also reported that agencies face a range of barriers when they attempt to collaborate with other agencies .
to illustrate these practices , we selected three areas where federal agencies have developed substantial ongoing collaborations: healthy people 2010 — a long - standing effort to develop and track public health objectives for the nation , wildland fire management , and health resource sharing between the department of veterans affairs ( va ) and dod at selected locations .
