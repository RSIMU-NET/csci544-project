gao was asked to ( 1 ) describe the two departments' processes for implementing their programs , ( 2 ) identify the costs and types of treatments implemented , and ( 3 ) determine whether these treatments are effective .
the department of the interior ( interior ) and the department of agriculture's ( usda's ) forest service — the two departments that manage most federal land — spend millions of dollars annually on such treatments .
both interior and usda's forest service use multidisciplinary teams of experts , such as ecologists and soil scientists , to assess damage and potential risks burnt land poses and to develop emergency stabilization and rehabilitation plans that identify needed treatments to reduce or eliminate those risks .
most burnt land can recover naturally , but a small percentage needs short - term emergency treatment to stabilize burnt land that threatens public safety , property , or ecosystems or longer - term treatments to rehabilitate land unlikely to recover naturally .
following the 2000 and 2001 fires , the forest service obligated $192 million and interior $118 million for 421 emergency stabilization and rehabilitation treatment plans gao reviewed .
when burnt lands threaten human health and safety , property , and ecosystems , treatment measures , such as seeding , may be undertaken to stabilize soils and mitigate these risks .
interior uses a single process to assess damage and identify treatments for short - term emergency stabilization and longer - term rehabilitation , while usda's forest service uses different processes for each of these two treatment types .
the two departments recognize these differences and recently agreed to work toward standardizing certain aspects of their programs , such as definitions and time frames .
the two departments differ in how they manage their programs , however .
treatments included seeding ; fencing ; installing soil erosion barriers such as straw bundles , or wattles ; and road or trail work .
you asked us to ( 1 ) describe interior's and usda's processes for implementing their emergency stabilization and rehabilitation programs , ( 2 ) identify the costs and types of treatments the departments have implemented , and ( 3 ) determine whether these treatments are effective .
to ensure effective emergency stabilization and rehabilitation treatments , gao recommends interior and usda ( 1 ) specify procedures to be used to monitor treatment effectiveness , including type and extent of monitoring data collected and methods to collect these data , and ( 2 ) develop an interagency system to collect , store , and disseminate information on monitoring results .
the forest service primarily seeded fast - growing grasses and built soil erosion barriers for emergency stabilization , and worked on roads , trails and reforested for rehabilitation .
if these weeds replace native plant species , threatened or endangered animals can lose their habitat .
neither the departments nor gao could determine whether emergency stabilization and rehabilitation treatments were achieving their intended results .
wildfires burn millions of acres annually .
however , they have not yet committed to this effort .
according to department of the interior ( interior ) and u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda's ) forest service data , only a small percentage of the many wildland fires that occur each year require such treatment .
