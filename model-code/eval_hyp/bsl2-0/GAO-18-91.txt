this report ( 1 ) describes what is known about how much chco council agencies used selected special payment authorities in fiscal years 2014-2016 ; ( 2 ) assesses the extent to which chco agencies evaluate the effectiveness of these authorities and identifies challenges , if any , the agencies reported facing in using the authorities to address mission - critical skills gap areas ; and ( 3 ) evaluates how opm has helped agencies address federal recruitment and retention needs .
you asked us to examine how much agencies use various available special payment authorities , challenges agencies face , and improvements needed to better ensure that agencies use these authorities to more effectively recruit and retain employees .
continued collaborative efforts between opm and the chco council assist agencies in using compensation flexibilities to address human capital challenges .
the office of personnel management ( opm ) works with agency chief human capital officers ( chcos ) to provide human capital tools and guidance to support agency missions .
moreover , we have reported that building agency capacity in using human capital flexibilities increases the likelihood of agencies using these tools appropriately and cost effectively to address human capital challenges .
our prior work has shown that increasing agencies' awareness of available flexibilities and evaluating existing tools are key aspects for successfully managing the range of human capital flexibilities .
these include special pay rates , incentives , and student loan repayments .
however , balancing constrained budgets with a potential wave of employee retirements and the need to fill gaps in mission - critical skills within the federal workforce underscores the need for agencies to cost effectively use special payment authorities .
we also analyzed opm's enterprise human resources integration ( ehri ) personnel data for fiscal year 2014 to describe the use of authorities by occupational family , and for fiscal year 2016 to determine the total number of federal employees at the chco agencies .
for example , skills gaps may arise in the form of: ( 1 ) staffing gaps , in which an agency has an insufficient number of individuals to complete its work ; ( 2 ) competency gaps , in which an agency has individuals without the appropriate skills , abilities , or behaviors to successfully perform the work ; or ( 3 ) both staffing and competency gaps .
to address our first objective , we administered a questionnaire to the 27 chco agencies to collect data on frequency of use , dollars spent , and whether agencies used the authorities to help address recruitment and retention needs in mission - critical skills gap areas in fiscal years 2014- 2016 .
mission - critical skills gaps may be broad — affecting several agencies — or may be specific to a given agency .
agencies can have skills gaps for different reasons .
we , and others including opm and federal agencies , have identified and reported on mission - critical skills gap areas across the government and within specific agencies .
the six government - wide areas identified were cybersecurity ; acquisition ; human resources ; auditing ; economics ; and science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) .
federal agencies can provide additional payments to current employees and offer additional compensation to prospective employees in certain circumstances to support their recruitment and retention efforts , and address human capital challenges .
