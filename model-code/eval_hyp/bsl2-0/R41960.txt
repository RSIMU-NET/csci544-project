epact 2005 required federal agencies to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency through increased use of renewable energy .
more recently , executive order 13514 ( sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions reduction ) directs federal agencies to establish greenhouse gas reduction targets through reduced energy intensity in buildings , increased renewable energy use , and renewable energy projects on agency property .
other laws authorize federal agencies to take advantage of privately financed energy efficiency improvements paid through savings in energy costs for minimum contract lengths of 25 years .
utilities also offer incentives to their agency - customers for reducing energy demand .
specifically , section 203 of epact required federal agencies to increase renewable energy purchases to a minimum of 7.5% of overall energy purchases by 2013 .
it has delegated this authority to the dod and other federal agencies .
since most renewable forms of energy available substitute for conventionally generated electric power ( including hydropower ) , federal agencies will likely meet the 7.5% goal through purchases of wind and solar photovoltaic generated power ; an equivalent of 4.3 million megawatt - hours based on fy2007 consumption .
however , the federal power marketing administrations ( pmas ) generate hydropower at more than twice the volume of annual federal power consumption , over 127 million megawatt - hours .
due to radar interference problems associated with wind turbines operating near military installations , solar photovoltaic power represents the most likely prospect for achieving site - generated power on dod facilities ( the largest federal consumer ) .
the department of defense ( dod ) alone consumed more than half , some 29 million megawatt - hours .
the general services administration ( gsa ) has general statutory authority to enter into utility service contracts of up to 10 years for all federal agencies .
agencies will receive double credit toward achieving the 7.5% goal for renewable energy generated on their facility sites .
this report summarizes the various statutes and regulations authorizing the general services administration ( gsa ) , the department of defense ( dod ) , and other federal agencies to enter into contracts for their electric utility services and purchase of renewable generated electricity .
executive order ( eo ) 13423 ( strengthening federal environmental , energy and transportation management , january 24 , 2007 ) followed up by requiring federal agencies to purchase at least one - half of their annual renewable energy from new renewable energy sources ( i.e. , placed in service after january 1 , 1999 ) , preferably from projects located on agency property where feasible .
dod also has the authority to enter into contracts of up to 30 years for power generation on military bases .
the pmas already sell a small percentage of their power to federal agencies , and have the authority to assist federal facilities in meeting their renewable energy goals .
as federal agencies work to meet their renewable energy goals , they encounter a number of options and barriers in contracting with small renewable power generators .
eo 13423 also allows agencies to use new "non - electric" renewable energy sources to meet the requirement for new renewable energy .
when federal agencies previously purchased "renewable energy certificates" ( recs ) to satisfy renewable energy goals , they received firm power backed by their service agreement .
