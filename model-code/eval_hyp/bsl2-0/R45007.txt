the u.s. department of labor ( dol ) published an updated rulemaking for the overtime exemptions for executive , administrative , and professional ( eap ) employees on may 23 , 2016 , with an effective date of december 1 , 2016 .
dol issued a request for information ( rfi ) related to the eap exemptions on july 25 , 2017 .
specifically , dol's rfi seeks information from the public regarding the eap exemptions to assist in formulating a proposal to revise them .
finally , on august 31 , 2017 , the u.s. district court for the eastern district of texas ruled that dol exceeded its authority by setting the threshold at the salary level in the 2016 rule and thus invalidated the 2016 rule .
in its ruling , the district court concluded , in part , that dol does not have the legal authority to use a salary level test as part of defining the eap exemptions .
on june 30 , 2017 , doj filed its reply brief in the case and requested that the court of appeals reverse the judgment of the district court ( related to the legal authority of dol to use salary level as part of the eap exemption ) but not rule on the validity of the salary level set in the 2016 rule .
subsequently , on december 1 , 2016 , the department of justice ( doj ) , on behalf of dol , filed a notice to appeal the injunction to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit .
subsequently , doj dropped its june 30 appeal of the original district court ruling .
however , on november 22 , 2016 , the u.s. district court for the eastern district of texas issued a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of the rule .
its major provisions include a federal minimum wage , overtime pay requirements , child labor protections , and recordkeeping requirements .
the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) is the primary federal statute providing labor standards for most , but not all , private and public sector employees .
the flsa was enacted in 1938 and has been amended numerous times , primarily for the purposes of expanding coverage or increasing the federal minimum wage rate .
the flsa also created the wage and hour division ( whd ) within dol to administer and enforce the act .
as such , the flsa was intended to "correct and as rapidly as practicable to eliminate" these detrimental conditions "without substantially curtailing employment or earning power. .
in enacting the flsa , congress noted the "existence , in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce , of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health , efficiency , and general well - being of workers. .
the correction of detrimental conditions was to be achieved through the establishment of a federal minimum wage , overtime pay requirements , and child labor protections .
that is , the flsa covers most workers but does not include individuals not considered employees ( e.g. , independent contractors ) .
thus , comparing the eap salary levels over time to price changes ( cpi - u ) and another federally regulated wage ( minimum wage ) provides context for the rule changes .
