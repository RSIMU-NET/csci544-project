rating methodologies generally vary between health insurance market segments and may have additional state - specific variation due to differences in state rate regulations .
the growth of health insurance premiums ( and out - of - pocket costs ) for individuals and families has been the focus of considerable congressional attention .
state regulators have adopted solvency standards to protect consumers by requiring insurance companies to keep certain reserves of capital to protect against asset risks , underwriting or insurance risk , and business risks .
premiums are typically paid in monthly installments by policyholders ( individual coverage ) and enrollees ( group coverage ) .
data from the bureau of labor statistics' ( bls's ) producer price index ( ppi ) for health insurance companies indicates that the year - over - year percentage increase by month in private health insurance premiums has averaged around 4.4% between 2004 and 2010 , but has accelerated some since 2009 , ranging from 4.8% - 5.5% ( figure 1 ) .
fourth , real income ( i.e. , income adjusted for inflation ) , both per capita and family , has decreased in the past several years .
third , as premiums have gone up , the value of the coverage has gone down in terms of higher cost sharing requirements , including deductibles ( see the appendix ) .
for example , the average worker share of the total premium for group coverage ( for self - only coverage ) was 15.3% in 2008 and grew to 17.0% by 2011 ( table 1 ) .
however , in the past few years employers have shifted incrementally more of that cost to workers .
the final premium rate calculation often is adjusted to reflect several other factors , such as making up for a previous financial loss and providing excess capital to manage various risks generally regulated under state solvency standards .
as a result , incomes are not keeping up with premium increases , and a greater proportion of incomes are being consumed by health insurance premiums .
without this required safety net of reserved cash , a health insurance company could go bankrupt if it experiences unforeseen losses , thus resulting in its consumers being placed at full financial risk for their medical claims .
generally , the more generous the benefits package ( i.e. , large , open networks of providers and low cost - sharing requirements including deductibles ) the higher the premiums will be .
premiums may vary for different individuals with the same health benefits package from the same insurance company .
real income for adults ( age 16 and older ) declined 4.6% , from an average of $40,389 in 2007 to $38,543 in 2010 .
using available public data , this report explores the potential drivers of the growth trend in health insurance premiums .
just as premiums must be adequate to pay for expected health care use , they also must be sufficient to compensate insurance carriers for taking on the financial risk associated with providing coverage .
typically , the following methods are used by market segment: individual health insurance market .
second , in the employer group market , the worker share of premiums has been increasing even more because employer subsidies have been trending down incrementally .
