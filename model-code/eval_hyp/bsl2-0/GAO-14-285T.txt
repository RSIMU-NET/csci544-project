ongoing improvements to safety , implementation of nextgen , and integration of uas continue to be paramount as congress considers faa's progress to date , and begins to consider the next reauthorization bill .
my statement today is based on work on these issues we have completed for the subcommittee since passage of the 2012 act , including ( 1 ) implementing nextgen , ( 2 ) improving aviation safety , particularly with respect to implementing provisions of the 2012 act related to faa's certification processes , and ( 3 ) integrating uas into the nas .
in addition , given the potential opportunities afforded by new unmanned aircraft systems ( uas ) , the 2012 act included several provisions with respect to faa safely integrating uas into the national airspace system ( nas ) .
thus , in the 2012 act , the congress directed faa to take various actions to improve the safety and efficiency of the current air traffic control ( atc ) system while transitioning to the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
i appreciate the opportunity to testify today on progress made by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in implementing key provisions of the faa modernization and reform act ( the 2012 act ) .
the 2012 act also directed us to complete eight studies on a variety of aviation topics .
nevertheless , faa must not become complacent because of the extraordinary level of connectivity and mobility the system affords us , or the safety record that has been achieved to date .
appendix ii lists seven of those mandated studies that have been completed and contains information on our key findings .
this statement is drawn from several reports that we completed since passage of the 2012 act , as well as additional reports from prior to the act on these topics .
the u.s. air transportation system is the busiest and among the safest in the world , with key aviation stakeholders — faa , the airlines and other aircraft operators , airports , aircraft manufacturers , and others — working together to achieve these results .
these , and other cost estimates for maintaining existing systems and facilities , along with implementing nextgen exceed anticipated funding levels .
more than 10 years ago , congress directed faa to conceptualize and plan nextgen ; faa is now implementing key nextgen systems and capabilities .
we have updated this information through a review of faa documents and interviews with faa officials , as well as interviews with relevant advisory groups .
the 2012 act included several provisions that address some of the issues that we have identified in our work , including incentivizing aircraft operators to equip with nextgen technologies , developing performance measures , and involving stakeholders in nextgen development.progress in implementing nextgen has highlighted ongoing challenges in our recent work on faa's three areas: improving leadership , demonstrating near - term benefits , and balancing the needs of the current system while implementing nextgen systems .
since 2006 , we have monitored faa's development of nextgen and identified a number of key challenges facing the agency's implementation efforts .
this change has not been fully implemented by faa .
nextgen was envisioned as a major redesign of the air transportation system to increase efficiency , enhance safety , and reduce flight delays that would entail precision satellite navigation and surveillance ; digital , networked communications ; an integrated weather system ; and more .
