in recent weeks , president bush announcedthat the united states has captured about halfthe senior leadership ; ( 18 ) other sources claim thatabout a third have been captured .
the estimates range as high as60,000 ( 7 ) and as low as 20,000 .
according to u.s. officials , the organization'sprevious communications network hasapparently been crippled , its leaders are on the run , and its afghanistan base has been largely eliminated .
 ( 19 ) many of theseterrorist leaders have been crucial participants in past alqaeda attacks ; the arrests of september 11 plotter and third - in - command khalid shaikh mohammed and operationschief abu zubaydah , for example , arebelieved to have hurt the organization and disrupted its operations .
 ( 15 ) al qaeda has also developed strong ties to other terrorist organizations , some new and some long - standing .
on one hand , clear progress inapprehending or killing senior leaders of al qaeda has been evident .
 ( 11 ) but since these are all estimates , it is not known what proportion of alqaeda membersu.s .

finally , some believe that there has been a spike in recruitment to the network as a result of the u.s. militaryoperations in iraq , leading to a worry that , despiteits serious recent losses , al qaeda could grow stronger in future months .
 ( 8 ) these assessmentsare inexact in part because the total number of camps that operated is not firmly agreed .
counterterrorism officials describe it more as an organic structure thatadapts to changing circumstances , including the loss of some senior leaders .
 ( 9 ) but even if experts knew the correct total number of camps andtrainees , not all the people who took the training necessarily became ( or remained ) actual members of theorganization .
 ( 10 ) the state department estimatesthatal qaeda "probably has several thousand members and associates. .
 ( 20 ) still , al qaeda is not like a state , whose regime you can remove in order to disable it .
 ( 24 ) many worry that this could illustratean evolution within al qaeda to a new generation .
 ( 12 ) but do operatives even necessarily need to be members ? .
for example , western experts are not exactly sure how many members it has now or has had in the past .
whether that transition will lead to something more or less dangerous is a point of contention .
there is a great deal that remains unknown or debatable about the specific nature , size , structure and reach of the organization , despite many years of studyingit .
is there a need for strategic reassessment of the successes and failuresof u.s. counterterrorism policy in thepost - iraq strategic environment , not only in the military and intelligence fields but also in foreign policy , lawenforcement , international cooperation , publicdiplomacy , foreign aid , homeland security , and elsewhere ? .
 ( 14 ) unlike manytraditional terrorist groups , al qaeda has no single standard operating procedure , although it does have awell - developed manual for its operations .
estimates are often based upon an approximationof how many people trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan and sudan .
