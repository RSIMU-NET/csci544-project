the common theme has been that serious vulnerabilities remain in addressing the federal government's year 2000 readiness , and that much more action is needed to ensure that federal agencies satisfactorily mitigate year 2000 risks to avoid debilitating consequences .
since that time , we have issued over 40 reports and testimony statements detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies .
no major organization , public or private , is immune from potential disruption , including a wide spectrum of government programs vital to americans .
my testimony today will discuss the results of the most recent reports submitted to the office of management and budget ( omb ) on the slow progress made by the federal government in achieving year 2000 compliance .
for this reason , in february 1997 we designated the year 2000 problem as a high - risk area for the federal government , and have published guidanceto help organizations successfully address the issue .
as the world's most advanced and most dependent user of information technology , the united states possesses close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of internet assets .
as a result , the year 2000 presents a particularly sweeping and urgent challenge for entities in this country .
as a result , if not modified , computer systems or applications that use dates or perform date - or time - sensitive calculations may generate incorrect results beyond 1999 .
in light of the pace of this progress , i will then provide our views on what needs to be done now to minimize disruptions to critical services .
we are pleased to join you again today to discuss the computing crisis — of which you are well aware — posed by the upcoming change of century .
 .
financial transactions could be delayed , airline flights grounded , and national defense affected .
as a result of federal agencies' slow progress , the public faces the risk that critical services could be severely disrupted by the year 2000 computing crisis .
the current year 2000 progress reports of most large agencies reinforce the need for the council to implement these recommendations .
the many interdependencies that exist among the levels of governments and within key economic sectors of our nation could cause a single failure to have wide - ranging repercussions .
in other areas , however , the chair has disagreed , and some actions have not been initiated .
further , the conversion council will also have to assume leadership and take whatever actions are warranted should difficulties arise in obtaining needed participation and cooperation from state and local governments and the private sector .
the council chair is to oversee federal agency year 2000 actions as well as be the spokesman in national and international forums ; coordinate with state , local , and tribal governments ; promote appropriate federal roles with respect to private - sector activities ; and report to the president — in conjunction with omb — on a quarterly basis .
omb has acted on these recommendations .
omb's reports to the congress — based on quarterly agency progress reports — have not fully reflected the true progress of the federal government toward year 2000 systems compliance because not all agencies have been required to report and , further , omb's reporting requirements have been incomplete .
