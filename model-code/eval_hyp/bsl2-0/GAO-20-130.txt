this report discusses: ( 1 ) the extent to which reduce the footprint performance measures reflect changes in civilian cfo act agencies' office space costs , and ( 2 ) how selected agencies considered costs in their office space decisions .
according to omb and the general services administration ( gsa ) , the 24 agencies subject to the chief financial officers act ( cfo act agencies ) have reduced their domestic office and warehouse space by more than 16 million total square feet and avoided an estimated $166 million in costs since fiscal year 2015 .
recognizing this , in march 2015 the office of management and budget ( omb ) directed agencies to reduce and more efficiently manage their space as part of the reduce the footprint ( rtf ) policy .
however , omb and gsa also reported that average costs per square foot have increased for some space , raising questions about the effects agencies' efforts have had on their actual real property costs .
you asked us to review how federal real property costs have changed since 2015 .
the federal government has faced long - standing challenges managing these assets in an efficient way .
while gsa measures rtf performance for all 24 cfo act agencies , we excluded the department of defense ( dod ) from our scope because of gsa concerns about the reliability of their data .
to assess the accuracy of the rtf cost performance measures used to monitor changes in agencies' office space costs , we analyzed data submitted by the 23 civilian cfo act agencies to the federal real property profile ( frpp ) and data maintained by gsa in its occupancy agreement database from fiscal year 2015 , the year rtf began , through fiscal year 2018 , the most recent year for which data were available .
moreover , as the rtf policy ends in fiscal year 2020 , it is unclear if agencies have reduced their space to the best possible size or how they will strive to optimize their office space size and costs going forward .
we assessed the reliability of these data by conducting electronic testing and interviewing gsa officials , among other steps , and determined that both datasets were reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives .
to understand how agencies considered cost in office space decisions , we selected five agencies — the department of education ( education ) , gsa , the internal revenue service ( irs ) within the department of the treasury , the department of labor ( labor ) , and the national institutes of health ( nih ) within the department of health and human services — to review in depth .
we selected projects with a range of locations and types , but selected only those with a cost of $1 million or more because these projects have more effect on overall costs .
we also selected 13 office space projects these agencies undertook from fiscal years 2015 through 2018 based on factors such as cost , location , changes in square footage , and project type to further understand how agencies considered cost in their decisions .
we also reviewed the methodologies gsa developed with omb for the cost performance measures , interviewed gsa and omb officials regarding the measures , and replicated one of the methods .
