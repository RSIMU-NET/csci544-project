medicare's total spending was approximately $565 billion that year .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers the medicare program — applies financial limits , known as therapy caps , to help control growth in expenditures for and discourage medically unnecessary use of outpatient therapy services .
although medicare therapy caps , which originally took effect beginning in 1999 under the balanced budget act of 1997 ( bba ) , are set annually at a level exceeding that used by most beneficiaries receiving therapy services , concerns had been raised that patients with extensive need for outpatient therapy services might be affected adversely .
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 , enacted in february 2012 , in addition to extending the exceptions process through december 31 , 2012 , made several changes affecting the processing of claims for outpatient therapy services .
according to cms , between 1998 and 2008 , medicare expenditures for outpatient therapy increased at a rate of 10.1 percent per year while the number of medicare beneficiaries receiving therapy services increased by 2.9 percent per year .
in particular , the act required cms to conduct manual medical reviews ( mmr ) of requests for exceptions for therapy claims over an annual threshold of $3,700 for ot and $3,700 for a combination of pt / slp for services provided on or after october 1 , 2012 .
to describe cms's implementation of the mmr process , we reviewed relevant statutes , including the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 , the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) , and the bba ; cms policies and guidance for the mmr of medicare outpatient therapy claims ; and cms data on mmrs for services provided during this 3-month period .
as a result , congress imposed temporary moratoria on the caps several times from 1999 through 2006 , when it required the agency to implement an exceptions process to provide coverage for beneficiaries in need of services above the caps .
in this report , we discuss ( 1 ) cms's implementation of the mmr process for outpatient therapy services conducted from october 1 , 2012 , through december 31 , 2012 , and ( 2 ) the number of individuals and claims subject to mmrs during the 3-month process and the outcomes of these reviews .
in addition , we and the hhs office of inspector general ( oig ) have previously reported that outpatient therapy is susceptible to improper payments and fraud .
we also interviewed cms staff responsible for implementation and oversight of the mandated mmr process as well as staff from the medicare payment advisory commission ( medpac ) and representatives from three professional associations for providers of outpatient therapy .
in 2011 , medicare , the federal health program insuring 48 million people who are age 65 and older or disabled , paid about $5.7 billion to provide three outpatient therapy services — physical therapy ( pt ) , occupational therapy ( ot ) , and speech - language pathology ( slp ) — for 4.9 million beneficiaries .
