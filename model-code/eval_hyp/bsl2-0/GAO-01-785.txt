in recent years , the department of defense ( dod ) has become increasingly concerned about its ability to retain enough personnel to fulfill its missions and is particularly concerned about retaining personnel who possess specialized skills .
overall , the military reports that it is meeting its aggregate retention goals , but dod leaders remain concerned that they are significantly challenged in their efforts to compete with the private sector for individuals with specialized skills .
human capital management is not only a problem for dod , but as we have reported , it is also an area of concern throughout the federal government today .
we focused our analysis on three areas: ( 1 ) what were the expectations and experiences of enlisted personnel , ( 2 ) how satisfied were they with military life and what were their career intentions , and ( 3 ) what were their perceptions of civilian work opportunities and quality of life .
widespread reports of flagging military morale raise an important question: is dissatisfaction with the military way of life driving highly trained individuals out , or are they being lured away by more favorable civilian opportunities ? .
in response to your request , we analyzed the results of dod's 1999 broad - based survey of active duty personnel to help shed light on why servicemembers in critical occupational areas might be leaving the military .
this analysis revealed that more military personnel are satisfied than dissatisfied with the military way of life .
following our testimony , the subcommittee asked us to use the final survey data to more closely examine the responses of personnel serving in retention - critical occupations and compare them to those of other enlisted personnel .
in 1998 , dod raised concerns about retention overall and about the quality and readiness of its forces .
we defined a difference to be both significant and meaningful if the responses of retention - critical personnel and other enlisted personnel differed by Â±7 percentage points .
however , dod and congress have long recognized that some servicemembers , particularly those in certain technical areas , can be difficult to retain .
in response to these concerns , congress increased military pay across - the - board and repealed legislation that lowered retirement benefits for some military personnel .
however , almost half of all enlisted personnel viewed vacation time , education opportunities , and health care as being better in the military .
combined , the services employ about 300,000 retention - critical enlisted personnel in these three broad areas .
we helped the department design this survey and previously testified before the subcommittee on the results of our preliminary analysis .
in addition , most enlisted personnel also believed promotion opportunities would be better in the civilian world .
identifying occupations that are retention - critical proved difficult because each service defines the term differently .
to address these objectives , we worked closely with each of the four services to determine what occupations they consider "retention - critical" because of their impact on readiness .
for instance , those serving in communications and intelligence occupations were much less positive about their ease of transition and ability to find a civilian job than were other enlisted personnel .
