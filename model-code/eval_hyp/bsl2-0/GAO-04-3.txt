as a result of these and other developments , commercial banks and their investment bank affiliates ( investment affiliates ) can provide complementary financial products and services .
despite these developments , commercial banks have remained subject to certain restrictions on their activities .
more recently , the gramm - leach - bliley act of 1999 , among other things , substantially removed that limitation .
in recent years , investment bank affiliates of large commercial banks have gained an increasing share of the annual $1.3 trillion debt underwriting market .
a controversy has arisen over whether or not unlawful tying has contributed to this increased market share .
some unaffiliated investment banks ( investment banks ) and some corporate borrowers contend that commercial banks have facilitated investment affiliates' increased market share of debt underwriting by unlawfully tying the availability of bank credit to debt underwriting by the bank's affiliate , a violation of section 106 .
to more fully examine the issues raised by the allegations about unlawful tying and underpricing of corporate credit , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) what evidence , if any , suggests that commercial banks with investment affiliates engage in unlawful tying ; ( 2 ) what steps the federal banking regulators have taken to examine for unlawful tying and the results of these efforts ; ( 3 ) what evidence , if any , suggests that commercial banks with investment affiliates unlawfully discount the price of corporate credit to obtain underwriting business for their investment affiliates ; and ( 4 ) what , if any , competitive advantages accounting rules , capital standards , and access to the federal safety net create for commercial banks over investment banks .
in the 70 years since the passage of the glass - steagall act of 1933 , which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities such as securities underwriting , changes in legislation and regulatory interpretations have relaxed some of the restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that served to distance commercial banks from investment banking .
in general , section 106 of the bank holding company act amendments of 1970 ( section 106 ) prohibits banks from tying the availability or price of a product or service to a customer's purchase of another product or service or the customer's providing some additional credit , property or service .
furthermore , officials from large commercial banks , federal banking and securities regulators , and investment bankers observe that ties between credit and other banking products are often customer - initiated , and thus exempt from the laws governing tying .
in our review of possible unlawful tying practices by large commercial banks , we focused on wholesale corporate lending and did not address retail banking .
in addition , some investment bankers assert that large commercial banks engage in unlawful tying by offering reduced rates for corporate credit only if the borrower also purchases debt underwriting services from the bank's investment affiliate .
should the reduced rate constitute an underpricing of credit ( that is , the extension of credit below market rates ) , the underpricing could also violate section 23b of the federal reserve act of 1913 ( section 23b ) .
