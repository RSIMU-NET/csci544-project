in july 2003 , congress passed the strengthen americorps program act ( pub .
in fiscal year 2003 the corporation was appropriated about $400 million to support americorps — about $300 million to support program operations and $100 million for the trust .
108-45 ) .
 ( 3 ) has the corporation made management and operational changes that ensure enrollments will not be suspended in the future and that address the strengthen americorps program act requirements ? .
the corporation receives appropriations to fund program operations and the national service trust ( the trust ) , which provides money to pay education awards .
in april of 2003 we provided a statement for the record to the subcommittee on veterans affairs , housing and urban development , and independent agencies of the senate committee on appropriations describing our preliminary observations regarding the causes for the enrollment suspension and the proposed policy changes .
 ( 2 ) how does the corporation estimate the funding needed to provide education awards through the trust ? .
in that statement , we emphasized that had the corporation appropriately recorded and tracked its obligations for education awards to program participants , the corporation likely would not have needed to suspend enrollments .
from november 2002 to march 2003 , the corporation suspended enrollments in americorps because it concluded that there would not be sufficient funds in the trust to pay the education awards for all of the 2002 program positions .
the act also established several other requirements for the corporation .
americorps is one of three national service programs the corporation oversees .
this act requires the corporation to obligate funds in the trust at the time americorps positions are approved and to estimate the value of the education awards based on a formula that considers historical rates of enrollment in the program and for the earning and use of education awards .
the corporation for national and community service ( the corporation ) was created in 1993 to help meet community needs in education , the environment , and public safety through activities such as tutoring and mentoring youth , building affordable housing , cleaning parks and streams , and helping communities respond to disasters .
because of concerns about the corporation's management of americorps and the trust , you asked us to answer the following questions: ( 1 ) has all americorps participant information been accurately recorded in the trust database ? .
l.no .
the corporation also helps to expand educational opportunity by providing national service participants who complete a term of service with funds — $4,725 for a full - time participant in 2002 — to help pay for their education .
we examined the model used by the trust to estimate its funding requirements and reviewed reports of auditors and contractors related to the model .
we surveyed all 148 americorps grantees for their views on the corporation's new enrollment and oversight policies as well as the training and technical support provided by the corporation , and obtained a response rate of 71 percent .
we obtained enough documentation to compare key information on 363 of 400 cases in our sample , or an estimated 157,045 of the 172,434 enrollments in the 2000 to 2002 program years .
