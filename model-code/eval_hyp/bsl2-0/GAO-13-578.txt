among usps's activities to enhance its revenue are negotiated service agreements ( nsa ) , sales , and promotions designed to increase or sustain mail volume and revenue through temporary discounts on specific mail products .
we examined ( 1 ) the nsas , sales , and promotions usps has developed and their reported financial results , and ( 2 ) any opportunities to generate additional revenue from nsas , sales , and promotions and any challenges that could hinder their development and implementation .
usps expects that its expenses will exceed revenue and that mail volume will continue to decline each year through fiscal year 2020 .
in 2010 , we reported on various options to generate additional revenue , including the use of nsas , as part of a broader report on options to facilitate usps's progress toward financial sustainability .
in 2012 , usps reached its $15-billion borrowing limit and incurred a $15.9-billion net loss .
as a result , usps's revenue has declined substantially .
as customers increasingly turn to digital communications and online payment methods , total mail volume has decreased precipitously , falling 25 percent from its peak in fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2012 .
since that time , usps has developed dozens more nsas , sales , and promotions , which you asked us to review .
although much of the focus has been on usps's costs as the way to close the gap between its revenues and expenses , generating additional revenue is also necessary .
we also reviewed the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) conclusions about nsas , sales , and promotions in their annual compliance determination reports .
to describe the nsas , sales , and promotions that usps has developed , as well as their reported financial results , we reviewed public and non - public documents .
for several years , the united states postal service ( usps ) has not generated sufficient revenues to cover its expenses , putting its mission to provide prompt , reliable , and efficient service at risk .
to summarize the financial results of nsas , we examined non - public versions of usps's cost and revenue analysis reports as well as other non - public usps documents that included the volume , cost , and revenue of individual nsas .
to identify and assess any opportunities to generate additional revenue from nsas , sales , and promotions , as well as challenges , if any , that could hinder their development and implementation , we reviewed usps and prc documents , and conducted interviews with stakeholders .
we also reviewed usps data collection reports for market dominant nsas .
specifically , we reviewed relevant regulations , prc proceedings , and internal usps evaluations of nsas .
to summarize the number of , and results from , usps sales and promotions , we reviewed usps documents requesting approval for sales and promotions and obtained additional data from usps on the estimated results of sales and promotions .
we assessed the reliability of these data sources by interviewing usps officials , and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes .
we also conducted interviews with officials from usps , prc , and 15 “mailers” to enhance our understanding of the circumstances in which nsas , sales , and promotions are developed and implemented .
