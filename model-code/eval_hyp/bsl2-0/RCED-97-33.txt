since 1993 , the department of energy has spent over $609 million to provide benefits to contractor employees separated in workforce restructuring and downsizing efforts at its facilities .
brought on by the end of the cold war , this downsizing has been carried out using the benefits provided by section 3161 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 , which requires energy to develop plans for minimizing the impact of downsizing on the workforce at affected facilities .
what steps has energy taken to oversee the implementation of the plans ? .
to what extent did the contractors at energy's facilities have to rehire workers or replace them with others having similar skills , because the downsizing was not targeted sufficiently to retain critically needed skills ? .
the former chairman and ranking minority member , in a july 18 , 1996 , letter , expressed concern about the costs associated with energy's implementation of these plans , particularly as the costs relate to workers hired after the end of the cold war .
what distinctions did energy make in determining who should receive these benefits ? .
we focused our analysis on the following questions: what types and amounts of benefits were provided to separated employees ? .
in addition , given energy's limited oversight of the implementation of restructuring plans , problems with excessive costs or inappropriate benefits , such as those identified by audit organizations , could occur in future restructurings .
since workforce restructuring will continue , the agency needs to ensure that this strategy will be effective in preventing similar problems in the future .
to address these concerns , energy has developed a strategy to incorporate lessons learned and to provide incentives for contractors to implement the plans in a cost - effective manner .
through improved guidance and emphasis on workforce planning , the agency has taken steps to improve its ability to conduct restructuring while meeting critical skill needs at its facilities .
energy has exercised wide discretion in restructuring its contractor workforce , defining the types and amounts of benefits and who should receive those benefits at its defense nuclear facilities and nondefense facilities .
energy's facilities have also had to reduce their workforce in response to overall cuts in the federal budget .
the workforce restructuring plans generally included similar types of separation payments and other benefits .
however , given the lack of tracking of employees below the level of principal contractor , it is difficult to determine how effective these steps have been .
since 1993 , the costs associated with these benefits have totaled about $609 million .
energy's office of worker and community transition is responsible for coordinating restructuring efforts , reviewing and approving workforce restructuring plans , and reporting on the status of the plans .
to carry out its missions , energy relies on contractors for the management , operation , maintenance , and support of its facilities .
since these early efforts , energy has taken steps to improve its ability to retain critically needed skills .
workforce restructuring costs were reported for 15 nondefense facilities .
since the end of the cold war , the agency's mission at its defense nuclear facilities has changed from weapons production to cleanup and environmental restoration , thus necessitating a change in employees' skills .
