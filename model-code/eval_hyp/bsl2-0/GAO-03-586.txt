in response to the growing importance of electricity information and concerns about its quality , you asked us to describe ( 1 ) the electricity information collected , used , and shared by key federal agencies in meeting their primary responsibilities and ( 2 ) the effect of restructuring on these federal agencies' collection , use , and sharing of this information .
in addressing these objectives , we primarily examined the information activities of ferc and the energy information administration ( eia ) within the department of energy ( doe ) .
for example , we recently reported that participants at a federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) conference raised concerns about the quality of price information due to the low volume of trading activity in some markets and to some market participants making inaccurate information available to the public .
in this changing and uncertain environment , accurate information on electricity trading and pricing is becoming more critical for not only evaluating the potential benefits and risks of restructuring , but also monitoring market performance and enforcing market rules .
in addition , information is critical to monitor emissions and comply with air quality standards in the future .
information on existing and new generating plants is critical in determining whether electricity supply will be sufficient to ensure reliable supplies .
information on the cost of electricity , for example , is critical in determining whether restructuring is achieving lower prices .
while information is becoming more critical for understanding how well restructuring is working , there are troubling indications that the quality of some information may be suspect .
however , opponents have raised concerns about restructuring in light of recent events , such as the extremely high electricity prices and market manipulation during the electricity crisis in california in 2000 and 2001 .
we focused on ferc because it bears the main responsibility for monitoring electricity markets , is undergoing major organizational changes caused by restructuring , and has faced significant challenges in responding to restructuring , as we have described in previous reports .
proponents of restructuring expect it to lead to a range of benefits for consumers , including lower prices and a wider array of retail electricity services than had previously been available .
industry experts have described the ongoing transition ( or restructuring ) of electricity markets from regulated monopolies to competitive markets as one of the largest single industrial reorganizations in the history of the world .
we focused on eia because it is the main u.s. statistical agency with responsibility for providing data and analysis covering the energy sector .
in addition to ferc and eia , we examined electricity - related activities at the office of fossil energy within doe , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , the rural utilities service ( rus ) at the u.s. department of agriculture , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , the department of justice , the federal trade commission , and the commodity futures trading commission .
due to limitations in the time frame for our review , we did not perform a detailed evaluation of these agencies' missions to determine whether information and data available to them was sufficient to meet their responsibilities .
moreover , legislation does not allow ferc to levy meaningful criminal fines and civil penalties against market participants to ensure that companies report accurate and reliable information , further diminishing its ability to identify potential market manipulation .
