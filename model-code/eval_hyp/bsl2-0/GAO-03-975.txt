for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 , the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) budget for 20 capacity - building and technical assistance programs was over $860 million .
since its inception in 1993 , the program has provided capacity - building funds and services to over 1,590 local organizations in more than 783 cities nationwide , either through direct grants or substantial technical assistance activities .
to assist you with your oversight of the section 4 capacity - building program , you asked us to describe how funding under section 4 of the hud demonstration act of 1993 has evolved and expanded over the years , how grantees use section 4 funding , and what other federal funding is available for capacity building ; determine the importance of section 4 funding to private sector involvement in community development initiatives ; and determine how hud and section 4 grantees control the management and measure the impact of section 4 programs .
of these funds , almost $150 million was specifically designated to build the capacity of local community development and affordable housing organizations through the section 4 program .
to address these objectives , we reviewed public laws , federal regulations , hud directives , budget documents , and other materials that describe the section 4 program and authorized / appropriated funding amounts .
we interviewed hud headquarters officials and grantee and subrecipient officials at both the national headquarters and local office levels .
additional federal funding , such as community development block grants , is also available to grantees for capacity building and technical assistance .
we conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards in baltimore , md ; boston , ma ; cleveland , oh ; frederick , md ; hughesville , md ; kingston , ri ; americus , ga ; and washington , d.c. our scope and methodology are discussed in greater detail at the end of this letter .
finally , we interviewed private funders that provided grants or loans to the grantees and subrecipients .
each grantee has initiatives in rural and tribal areas .
we visited subrecipients in eight cities , and at several we conducted file reviews to evaluate grantee internal controls .
originally the act focused on providing funding for capacity building in 23 urban areas .
the grantees' organizational structures and missions vary , as do their strategies for awarding section 4 funds and the types of activities they authorize .
currently , it provides funding to groups and activities in urban , rural , and tribal areas nationwide .
several federal programs offer capacity - building funds: cdbg , home , and housing opportunities for persons with aids ( hopwa ) .
in 1997 , section 4 was expanded to include two more grantees , hfhi and ybusa as well as more cities , and rural and tribal areas .
while hud has overarching responsibility for detecting such internal control failures , the cost - effectiveness of adding additional federal controls at the subrecipient level must be weighed against the size of the program and the amount of federal funding involved .
congress' goal in authorizing hud to participate in ncdi was to develop the capacity and ability of cdcs to undertake community development and affordable housing projects and programs .
