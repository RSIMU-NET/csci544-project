in 2008 , congress provided $1.1 billion for basic educational expenses under the impact aid program .
although funding for school operations and construction is primarily considered a state and local issue , the congress established the impact aid program in 1950 to provide funding to school districts that are adversely impacted by a lack of local revenue because of the presence of federal land .
under the impact aid basic support program , the department of education ( education ) awards funding to school districts generally on the basis of the number of federally connected students they serve , such as those students residing on indian lands or military bases or who have parents in the military or who work on federal lands .
state and local governments spend billions of dollars annually on the construction , renovation , and maintenance of public school facilities .
education distributed these funds to about 1,200 school districts , with about half of the funds going to impact aid school districts that have students residing on indian lands .
this is because indian students often attend schools in rural areas with higher levels of poverty , and compared with other students often have poorer educational outcomes , such as lower scores on standardized tests and lower graduation rates .
however , concerns persist about the conditions of some school facilities , particularly those located near indian lands .
to maintain and build public school facilities , school districts generally rely on their local tax base .

some school districts have limited access to this source of revenue because a portion of the nearby land is owned by the federal government , which is exempt from local property taxes .
some education experts believe the condition of public school facilities can affect student outcomes , and numerous studies have attempted to document possible associations .
what information is available on the physical condition of facilities in school districts that receive federal impact aid due to students residing on indian lands ? .

we use the term “indian impact aid” to refer to those school districts that qualify to receive impact aid basic support funding because they meet the minimum eligibility criteria , namely they have at least 400 students in average daily attendance who are federally connected , in this case who reside on indian lands , or such students comprise at least 3 percent of the total number of students in the district .
in response to your request that we describe the condition of facilities in school districts that receive impact aid for students residing on indian lands , this report addresses the following questions: 1 .
