management has implemented internal controls which , if properly implemented and adhered to , should prevent future noncompliances .
in conjunction with our 1995 tests for compliance with selected provisions of certain laws and regulations , management disclosed an antideficiency act violation related to noncompliance with a congressional spending limitation .
no other reportable instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations were disclosed for the provisions tested .
also , our opinion states that management's assertion is fairly stated that , although improvements are needed in internal controls related to the review of the classification of obligations for consultant services under congressional spending limitation , internal controls in effect on september 30 , 1995 , provided reasonable assurance that losses , noncompliance , or misstatements material to the financial statements would be prevented or detected .
our opinion states that the panama canal commission's financial statements present fairly , in all material respects , its financial position as of september 30 , 1995 and 1994 , and the results of its operations , changes in capital , and cash flows for the years then ended , in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles .
this report presents the results of our audits of the panama canal commission's financial statements for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 1995 and 1994 , its assertion on internal controls , and its compliance with laws and regulations .
the noncompliance was not material to the financial statements .
on october 1 , 1979 , the commission was established as an executive agency to carry out the responsibilities of the united states with respect to the panama canal treaty of 1977 .
our audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
during the course of the 1995 audit , we also noted that the commission significantly improved general controls over the computerized information systems .
the commission will operate the canal until the treaty terminates on december 31 , 1999 , when the republic of panama will assume full responsibility for the canal .
during the period covered by these audits , we were required by the panama canal act of 1979 to conduct an annual audit of the commission's financial statements .
the commission has corrected , or is in the process of correcting , all general control weaknesses identified and reported in that letter .
we had identified matters for improvement and communicated them to the commission in a previous management letter .
we noted no internal control weaknesses during our audit of their fiscal year 1995 financial statements that needed to be communicated to the commission in a separate management letter .
the ability to cover these future costs , including administrative costs , is dependent upon ( 1 ) obtaining the budgeted levels of canal operations and ( 2 ) future economic events .
because of inherent limitations in any internal control structure , losses , noncompliance , or misstatements may nevertheless occur and not be detected .
capital increased by 5.6 percent to $588 million .
we limited our internal control testing to those controls necessary to achieve the objectives outlined in our opinion on management's assertion about the effectiveness of internal controls .
the commission exceeded its $50,030,000 congressional spending limitation for administrative expenses , as set forth in the fiscal year 1995 appropriation ( public law 103-331 ) by $160,225 .
