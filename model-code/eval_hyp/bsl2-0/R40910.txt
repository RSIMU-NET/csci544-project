the climate change issue has become politically significant internationally and domestically , with major legislation to control greenhouse gases passed by the house ( h.r .
2454 ) and under development in the senate ( s. 1733 among others ) .
resulting anger could spill over into other international issues , influencing other u.s. foreign policy objectives .
pivotal discussions include: whether measurable commitments to reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions will include all major emitting countries and how deep reduction commitments would be ; whether countries will agree to transparency and accountability regarding their commitments through robust measuring , reporting , and verification ( mrv ) requirements ; how much financing may be available for capacity building , ghg reductions , avoiding deforestation and forest degradation , technology cooperation , and adaptation to climate change in developing countries through private sector mechanisms and public finance , and what institutions may oversee such flows ; what means of technology cooperation would help to develop and deploy advanced , low - or no - emitting technologies , as well as to assist adaptation to climate impacts ; and what mechanisms and resources would assist the most vulnerable countries to adapt to projected climate change .
in december 2008 , the then - incoming obama administration stated its policy to reduce u.s. emissions to 14% below 2005 levels by 2020 .
domestic legislation will interplay with any commitments made internationally , and actions taken by other countries to address climate change will likely have an impact on the united states .
china also announced a voluntary , domestic goal of reducing its carbon intensity ( carbon dioxide emissions per unit of economic output ) by 40% - 45% below 2005 levels by 2020 , which could hold emissions approximately to current levels .
smaller countries , concerned about the impacts of climate change on their welfare and economies , and looking to the united states and other large , wealthy countries for leadership on climate change , have become increasingly frustrated .
negotiations had lagged through 2008 .
the obama 14% reduction policy and passage by the u.s. house of representatives of h.r .
it also is unclear that several major non - annex i country emitters would agree within an international accord to verifiable and significant ghg reduction commitments â€” which they have strongly resisted .
lack of strong political agreements has led to recent demonstrations in as many as 4,500 locations in 170 countries .
india followed suit with a domestic goal to reduce its emissions intensity by 20-25% below 2005 levels by 2020 .
optimism among many grew that the u.s. congress would pass ghg control legislation before the copenhagen meeting , providing guidance to the executive branch negotiators regarding the elements of a treaty that the senate would ultimately consent to ratify .
2454 ( the american clean energy and security act ( aces ) , or the "waxman - markey" bill ) have led to reinvigorated hopes of some people that consensus among countries could be found by december 2009 on a comprehensive copenhagen agreement with quantified commitments .
while all parties may contribute to a potential breakdown , many people would blame the united states .
congress will decide whether the united states becomes a party to any agreement .
