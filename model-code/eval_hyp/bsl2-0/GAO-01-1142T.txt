in september 2000 , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) — now the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) — took steps to reduce medicare's payment for part b - covered drugs by authorizing medicare carriers , the contractors that pay part b claims , to use prices obtained in the justice department investigations of providers' drug acquisition costs .
in december 2000 , as part of recent medicare legislation , the congress asked us to study medicare's payments for part b - covered drugs and make recommendations for pricing methodology refinements .
studies by the department of justice , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of the inspector general ( oig ) , and the house committee on commerce show that medicare's payment for these drugs in some cases is significantly higher than the actual costs to the physicians and other providers who bill medicare for these products .
hcfa retracted this authority in november 2000 following concerns raised by providers .
my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) medicare payment policies to cover part b - covered drug costs and costs of administering the drugs and ( 2 ) key features of other payers' reimbursement policies that suggest opportunities to improve the appropriateness of medicare's payments .
most of the part b drugs with the highest medicare payments and billing volume fall into three categories: those that are billed for by physicians and typically provided in a physician office setting ( such as chemotherapy drugs ) , those that are billed for by pharmacy suppliers and administered through a durable medical equipment ( dme ) item ( such as a respiratory drug given in conjunction with a nebulizer ) , and those that are also billed by pharmacy suppliers but are patient - administered and covered explicitly by statute .
the pricing of these drugs — largely drugs that cannot be administered by patients themselves — has been under scrutiny for several years .
we have reported our findings and made recommendations , as mandated , today .
how other federal agencies have exercised their leverage may offer more applicable lessons .
my comments are based primarily on our study of medicare payments for part b - covered drugs and a forthcoming study of physicians' practice expense payments under medicare's fee schedule .
in summary , our study shows that medicare's method for establishing drug payments is flawed .
medicare pays 95 percent of the average wholesale price ( awp ) , which , despite its name , may be neither an average nor what wholesalers charge .
for both physician - billed drugs and pharmacy supplier - billed drugs , medicare payments often far exceeded widely available prices .
in 1999 , spending for medicare part b - covered prescription drugs totaled almost $4 billion .
for delivering pharmacy supplier - billed drugs , medicare's payment policies are uneven .
i am pleased to be here as you discuss the pricing of medicare's part b - covered prescription drugs .
we found that , in 2001 , widely available prices at which providers could purchase drugs were substantially below awp , on which medicare payments are based .
