for example , in fiscal year 2000 , the department of defense ( dod ) awarded contracts valued at about $36.2 billion without competition .
this subcommittee has been concerned about the use of waivers .
in view of this concern , you requested that we examine ( 1 ) the extent to which dod is using these waivers and why , ( 2 ) the data and analyses dod is relying on to arrive at a price , ( 3 ) factors that minimize or increase risks of inflated prices , and ( 4 ) whether dod has provided adequate guidance to minimize these risks .
a key concern is that regulations do not provide adequate guidance on when waivers should be used .
in these cases , contractors and subcontractors normally provide the government with cost or pricing data supporting their proposed prices and certify that the data submitted are accurate , complete , and current .
in these instances , contracting officers use other techniques to arrive at fair and reasonable prices .
this requirement , established by the truth in negotiations act , is meant to protect against inflated prices , by ensuring that the government has the data it needs to effectively negotiate with the contractor .
however , the government can waive the requirement for certified data in exceptional cases .
without certified data , the government has less information to determine a fair price .
to maximize the value of taxpayer dollars , the federal government generally seeks to award its contracts through competition .
instead , it must turn to a single source for its procurements .
however , the government also buys unique products and services , including sophisticated weapons systems , for which it cannot always rely on competition to get the best prices and values .
our scope and methodology are discussed in appendix i .
by developing guidance to encourage all contracting officers to take such steps and to help buying organizations weigh the decision to grant waivers , dod could reduce its risk of inflated pricing even further .
more indirect factors contributing to uncertainty include mergers and acquisitions , cost - cutting measures , or changes in relationships with subcontractors .
using dod's contract database , we identified 20 waivers valued at more than $5 million each in fiscal year 2000 .
the total value of these waivers was about $4.4 billion .
we recommend that the secretary of defense work with the office of federal procurement policy to develop guidance to be included in the federal acquisition regulation to minimize the risk of inflated pricing when waivers for certified cost or pricing data are granted to its contractors and subcontractors .
in some cases , contracting officers still make a considerable effort to reduce risks , such as performing detailed price or cost analyses , involving pricing and contracting experts , and relying on data that were recently certified .
we further recommend that the secretary survey buying organizations to assess whether additional specific issues not covered within existing guidance need to be clarified .
this guidance should ( 1 ) clarify situations in which an exceptional case waiver may be granted , ( 2 ) identify what type of data and analyses are recommended for arriving at a price when waivers are granted , and ( 3 ) identify what kinds of outside assistance should be obtained .
