also , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) has recently identified issues related to reduced cost visibility and financial management in converting shipyards from working capital funding to direct funding .
 ( the 11 specific matters in section 322 ( b ) ( 2 ) are listed in app .
the navy report was to include an assessment of 11 matters , including cost visibility , operational and financial flexibility , capital improvements , buyout costs associated with the transfer of the navy's two east coast shipyards from the navy working capital fund to direct funding , and compliance with legislative provisions .
section 322 ( b ) ( 3 ) also directed our office to review the navy's report , which was to include our assessment of whether the report adequately addresses the 11 matters identified in section 322 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the act .
our objectives were to evaluate the extent to which the navy's report ( 1 ) provided data and other supporting evidence for its overall assessment of the impact of converting puget sound to direct funding , ( 2 ) addressed unresolved issues that had been identified in prior studies , and ( 3 ) disclosed any other issues that have affected the implementation of direct funding at puget sound naval shipyard .
according to the navy , direct funding , in concert with regional consolidation , enabled maintenance activities to quickly respond to emergent fleet operational requirements .
the report's overall assessment was that direct funding provides for a more agile workforce that can best satisfy fleet maintenance priorities without sacrificing cost visibility , performance accountability , or quality of work .
section 322 ( a ) of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 prohibited the navy from converting its two east coast shipyards to direct funding prior to october 1 , 2006 , and section 322 ( b ) of the act required the secretary of the navy to submit a report to the congressional defense committees by march 1 , 2006 , that assessed the effects of converting puget sound from the working capital fund to direct funding .
a more recent review of the conversion of puget sound naval shipyard to direct funding by the dod office of the inspector general ( dod - ig ) identified weaknesses in cost visibility and financial management at that facility .
the navy submitted its report to congress on march 1 , 2006 .
since the 1990s , the navy has implemented changes aimed at making its fleet support activities more efficient and effective .
on may 18 and 19 , 2006 , we briefed congressional staff on our preliminary observations .
in our prior reviews of the consolidation of maintenance facilities at pearl harbor , we identified unresolved issues in financial management related to the conversion of the shipyard to direct funding .
the navy set up a single financial structure for the consolidated facilities using direct funding in the belief that direct funding was more flexible than working capital funding and would help enable the consolidated facilities to better achieve navy fleet readiness goals .

this report expands on the information delivered in those briefings and includes recommendations to the secretary of defense .
