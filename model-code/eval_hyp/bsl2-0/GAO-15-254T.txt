research and development , and 3 ) how other countries have progressed toward uas integration into their airspace for commercial purposes .
i appreciate the opportunity to testify on the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) efforts to integrate unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) into the national airspace system ( nas ) .
for our ongoing work , we reviewed faa's comprehensive plan and roadmap for uas integration .
the united states has been on a path toward uas integration for years .
we also conducted semi - structured interviews with faa officials and a wide range of stakeholders , including representatives of federal agencies such as department of defense ( dod ) , national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , test site officials , research organizations , academics , and industry experts .
112-95 , §§ 331 – 335 , 126 stat .
to identify how other countries have progressed toward uas integration for civil and commercial purposes , we spoke with the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) and other stakeholders familiar with the uas activities currently occurring in other countries .
for this testimony we updated our prior work on the status of faa's efforts to meet uas requirements in the 2012 act , by reviewing faa documents , applicable laws , regulations , and program guidance .
the agency's rulemaking efforts related to uas began in 2008 , when faa established a committee to develop rules for the operation of small uass .

these provisions outlined 17 date specific requirements and set deadlines for faa to achieve safe uas integration by september 2015 ( see app .
to identify the key efforts and opportunities associated with the faa's obtaining research , development , and operations data to support uas integration , we reviewed documents from each of the six test sites where faa has recently allowed uas operations and spoke with officials from three of the test sites .
l. no .
my statement is based on our prior products on uas issued since 2012 , selected updates on this work , as well as preliminary observations of our ongoing study of uas integration into the nas underway for this committee and others .
detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in those products .
both the faa and uas industry stakeholders have emphasized the importance of finalizing uas regulations as unauthorized uas operations in the national airspace continue to increase and present a safety risk to commercial and general aviation activities .
we also reviewed relevant empirical literature and media reports to obtain information and perspectives on current developments and future challenges , and spoke with representatives from canada's aviation authority to understand their regulations related to uas and associated activities .
some stakeholders told us in interviews that faa's accomplishments to date are significant and were needed , but these stakeholders noted that the most important provisions of the 2012 act have been significantly delayed or are unlikely to be achieved by the mandated dates .
while faa has completed several of these requirements , some key ones , including the publication of the final small uas rule , remain incomplete .
