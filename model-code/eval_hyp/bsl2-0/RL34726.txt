to address some issues involving the interpretation of the fsia , among other related matters , congress is considering the justice against sponsors of terrorism act ( s. 2040 , h.r .
3815 ) .this report addresses relevant legislative developments in its final section .
victims , however , have sued numerous individuals and groups with less direct ties to the attackers , including defendants who allegedly provided monetary support to al qaeda prior to september 11 , 2001 .
this report explains the legal bases for the dismissals and provides an update to the status of the case .
in r e terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , is a consolidated case that includes , among other claims , claims against the kingdom of saudi arabia , several saudi princes , a saudi banker , and a saudi charity .
this effort also failed on sovereign immunity grounds at the district court , however , and is once again on appeal at the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit .
plaintiffs argued that these saudi defendants played a "critical role" in the september 11 attacks by giving money to muslim groups , which in turn funded al qaeda .
n umerous legal and practical obstacles , such as the infeasibility of locating al qaeda operatives , stand in the way of victims seeking to establish liability in u.s. courts against , and recover damages from , the terrorists who planned and carried out the september 11 , 2001 , attacks .
however , part of the reasoning for the dismissals was later overturned , and the plaintiffs were permitted a second chance to bring their suit against the saudi government and government - owned charity .
in august 2008 , the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed dismissals of the claims against the saudi defendants .
several bills have been introduced in congress that would broaden the fsia tort exception explicitly to cover terrorist acts that occur within the united states and make other changes that could boost plaintiffs' efforts against some of the saudi defendants .
however , the fsia authorizes jurisdiction over foreign nations in several exceptions .
namely , a foreign state is not immune from u.s. courts' jurisdiction where ( 1 ) the foreign state has waived its immunity ; ( 2 ) the claim is a specific type of admiralty claim ; ( 3 ) Â the claim involves commercial activities ; ( 4 ) the claim implicates property rights connected with the united states ; ( 5 ) the claim arises from tortious conduct that occurred in the united states ; ( 6 ) the claim is made pursuant to an arbitration agreement ; or ( 7 ) the claim seeks money damages against a designated state sponsor of terrorism for injuries arising from a terrorist act .
the foreign sovereign immunities act ( the fsia ) applies to all foreign states and their "agencies and instrumentalities. .
immunity for sovereign nations against suits in u.s. courts has a long history and is based on the principle that conflicts with foreign nations are more effectively addressed through diplomatic efforts than through judicial proceedings .
in the 112 th congress , new legislation was introduced to reduce some of the burdens faced by victims of state - sponsored terrorism in the united states who seek to bring lawsuits against foreign officials .
