the food and drug administration ( fda ) — an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — is responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of drugs marketed in the united states , including addressing drug shortages .
993 ( 2012 ) .
a unit within fda , referred to as the drug shortage staff ( dss ) , coordinates the agency's activities to prevent , alleviate , and resolve shortages .
over the last decade , an increasing number of prescription drugs — including life - saving and life - sustaining drugs — have been in short supply , preventing health care providers and patients from accessing medications that are essential for treatment .
during shortages , providers — including hospitals , physicians , and pharmacists — may have to use medications that could be less effective for treating conditions or carry unwanted side - effects , if alternatives are available at all .
fda's role in resolving them , among other things.the trends in recent drug shortages and describes what is known about their effect on patients and providers , ( 2 ) examines the causes of drug shortages , and ( 3 ) evaluates the progress fda has made in addressing drug shortages .
fda defines a drug shortage as a situation in which the total supply of all clinically interchangeable versions of an fda - regulated drug is inadequate to meet the current or projected demand .
to evaluate the progress fda has made in responding to drug shortages , we reviewed documentation and interviewed fda officials regarding the agency's current approach to managing drug shortages and implementing fdasia requirements .
in november 2011 , we reported on the growing number of drug shortages and their causes and found that the agency lacked sufficient authority to respond to shortages .
according to a uudis official , uudis would consider the shortage to be resolved ( 1 ) when manufacturers a , b , and c all have all strengths and package sizes back in stock ; ( 2 ) if manufacturer a decides to discontinue its product , when manufacturers b and manufacturer c both have all strengths and package sizes back in stock ; or ( 3 ) when uudis obtains other information indicating that a shortage has been resolved , such as fda telling uudis that manufacturers b and c have increased supply and all market need has been met .
this included reviewing fda data related to drug shortages , including information contained in its recently created drug shortages database and information about shortages published on its website .
our analysis focuses on shortages of prescription drugs , so we excluded shortages of over - the - counter drugs , biologics ( including vaccines ) , medical devices , and orally - administered vitamins from our analysis even though uudis also tracks and includes these shortages in its data .
we recommended that fda strengthen its response and suggested that congress consider establishing a requirement for manufacturers to report potential or actual supply disruptions to fda .
from prolonged duration of a disease , to permanent injury , to death , drug shortages have led to harmful outcomes for patients of all ages .
identified as critical because alternative medications were unavailable , the shortages affected multiple manufacturers , or it received multiple reports from different institutions .
