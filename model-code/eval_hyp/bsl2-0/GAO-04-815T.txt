federal gulf war illnesses research projects have been funded primarily by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the department of defense ( dod ) , and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
gulf war veterans' reports of illnesses and possible exposures to several known and potential health hazards have prompted numerous federal research projects on the nature , extent , and treatment of gulf war illnesses .
in 2002 , a congressionally mandated federal advisory committee — the va research advisory committee on gulf war veterans' illnesses ( rac ) — was established to provide advice on federal gulf war illnesses research needs and priorities to the secretary of va .
scientists have agreed that many veterans have unexplained illnesses — commonly referred to as gulf war illnesses — that are characterized by one or more symptoms that do not conform to a standard diagnosis .
in recent years , va and dod have decreased their expenditures on research specifically for gulf war illnesses and have expanded the scope of their medical research programs to incorporate the long - term health effects of all hazardous deployments .
in 1993 , the president named the secretary of va as the responsible party for coordinating research activities undertaken or funded by the executive branch of the federal government on the health consequences of service in the gulf war .
interagency committees formed by va to coordinate federal gulf war illnesses research evolved to reflect these changing priorities , but over time these entities have been dissolved or have become inactive .
in the years following the 1991 persian gulf war , approximately 80,000 veterans have reported various symptoms including fatigue , muscle and joint pains , headaches , memory loss , skin rash , diarrhea , and sleep disturbances .
the report also includes a description of the status of dod's investigations on potential exposures of service members and veterans to health hazards , such as chemical and biological agents , and efforts that have been made by va and dod to monitor cancer incidence among gulf war veterans .
rac's efforts to provide advice and make recommendations on gulf war illnesses research may have been hampered by va senior administrators' incomplete or unclear information sharing and limited collaboration on gulf war illnesses research initiatives and program planning .
the committee is made up of members of the general public , including non - va researchers and veterans' advocates .
as of september 2003 , about 80 percent of the 240 federally funded medical research projects for gulf war illnesses had been completed .
my statement is based on our report entitled department of veterans affairs: federal gulf war illnesses research strategy needs reassessment ( gao - 04-767 ) , which will be issued today .
in addition , va has not reassessed the extent to which the collective findings of completed gulf war illnesses research projects have addressed key research questions or whether the questions remain relevant .
for example , va failed to inform rac about its 2002 major research program announcement that included gulf war illnesses research .
my remarks will summarize our findings on the status of federal research on gulf war illnesses and va's communication and collaboration with rac .
