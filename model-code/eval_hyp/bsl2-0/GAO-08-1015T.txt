these grants are generally for behavioral projects .
nhtsa and fmcsa administer almost half of federal safety funding through grants provided to states for their safety programs .
my statement today focuses on our ongoing work on the federal highway administration's ( fhwa ) highway safety improvement program ( hsip ) .
fhwa is not alone in funding state safety programs .
the department of transportation ( dot ) encourages states to align their nhtsa - or fmcsa - funded programs with the strategic highway safety plans they develop in implementing hsip , but such alignment is not required .
congress significantly revised hsip through the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea - lu ) , passed in august 2005 .
key revisions include the following: the annual authorization for hsip nearly doubled to about $1.3 billion per year .
states must now prepare a strategic highway safety plan that addresses all aspects of highway safety , which include infrastructure improvements , behavioral approaches such as education and enforcement projects meant to change drivers' behavior , and emergency medical services approaches .
the program , established in 1973 , provides funds through the federal aid highway program to states primarily for infrastructure and other improvements designed to reduce the number of crashes , serious injuries , and fatalities on the nation's roads .
the act authorizes $90 million per year to address hazards on rural roads defined as high risk .
many states are still in the early stages of implementing the set - aside program for high - risk rural roads and have yet to obligate significant funds for projects , and data limitations may be hindering their ability to target program funds to eligible projects .
the act created a new $90 million per year set - aside for infrastructure projects on high - risk rural roads and defined these roads .
projects on roadways that meet the act's definition are eligible for funding under the program .
my testimony today addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which states have implemented hsip requirements set forth in safetea - lu , including key elements of strategic highway safety plans and crash data analysis systems , ( 2 ) the types of guidance and assistance fhwa provided to the states to support them in planning and carrying out hsip , and ( 3 ) the results to date of states' efforts in carrying out hsip , including the results of the set - aside programs for rail - highway crossings and for high - risk rural roads .
the act added a provision that allows states to transfer , or flex , up to 10 percent of their hsip funds to behavioral and emergency medical services projects provided the state has adopted a strategic highway safety plan and certified that it has met all its safety infrastructure needs .
during 2006 , about 43,000 traffic fatalities occurred and 290,000 people were seriously injured .
safetea - lu created this program because over half of highway fatalities occur on rural roads .
because states remain in the early stages of implementing the program , obligations made to date are low ; for example , through june 2008 , program obligations for all years under saftetea - lu totaled $50.3 million , compared with almost $270 million authorized through that time period .
