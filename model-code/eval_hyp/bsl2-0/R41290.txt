rather , ms. kagan argues that first amendment case law is designed to prevent the government from enacting laws that are more likely to spring from improper motives .
in another article , she offers suggestions for developing statutes that would be consonant with her understanding of first amendment case law , and , therefore , more likely to be upheld as constitutional .
this report will discuss some of her most significant scholarly articles related to the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech .
ms. kagan does not appear to be arguing for a change in first amendment analysis , or hinting towards how she believes cases would be better analyzed .
in her first amendment scholarship , ms. kagan seems primarily concerned with developing an understanding of the evolution of the supreme court's first amendment jurisprudence .
it is unclear how this scholarship would apply or even if it would apply in the context of her position as a supreme court justice , if she is confirmed .
president obama has nominated his solicitor general , elena kagan , to be the next supreme court justice .
if confirmed , she would fill the seat being vacated by justice john paul stevens upon his retirement at the end of the 2009 / 2010 term .
prior to her term as solicitor general , ms. kagan , in her capacity as an academic and scholar , wrote influential pieces analyzing free speech jurisprudence .
here , she focused primarily on the design of laws that would restrict hate speech and pornography , with an eye towards designing restrictions that , in her view , would be more likely to be upheld by the supreme court .
and , as would be logically expected , the court also scrutinizes less closely laws that carry less risk of improper motive .
some of the same themes as in the article above are evident , though possibly in their earlier stages of development , but her focus was different in writing this article as well .
many developments in first amendment jurisprudence have occurred since then .
the most comprehensive article ( over 100 pages ) ms. kagan has written on the first amendment is "private speech , public purpose: the role of governmental motive in first amendment doctrine. .
in the course of building this argument , ms. kagan analyzes many aspects of first amendment law including campaign finance cases , indecency cases , fighting words cases , and the logic of the secondary effects doctrine .
consequently , most analysis of first amendment doctrine focuses on the potential effects of the restrictions to attempt to create coherent theories .
to the extent possible , recent developments will be mentioned and compared to ms. kagan's arguments .
courts instead are to focus on the effects of a particular speech restriction on first amendment freedoms .
therefore , her argument continues , the court has developed a schema that more closely scrutinizes laws that are at a greater risk of being improperly motivated in their enactment .
instead , she appears to take the position that assuming her understanding of the court's doctrine is correct , statutes may be designed to comport with that doctrine and restrict some hate speech and pornography , though certainly not all .
