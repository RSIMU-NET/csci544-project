president bush and other u.s. officials immediately condemned the test and called for a swift response from the united nations security council ( unsc ) .
since the united states threatened financial sanctions on banks that do business with north korea in september 2005 , pyongyang had boycotted the six - party talks ( with south korea , japan , china, and russia ) , the multilateral forum dedicated to eliminating north korea's nuclear weapons program .
on december 8 , 2006 , president bush officially determined that north korea had detonated a nuclear explosive device , as required by section 102 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the arms export control act ( p.l .
at the u.n. , the united states pushed for punitive sanctions and drafted a resolution that was eventually unanimously adopted .
90-629 ) .
in a hastily - arranged trip to the region , secretary of state rice reiterated the u.s. security commitment to south korea and japan and urged china and south korea to implement key measures of the u.n. resolution .
since the end of the agreed framework in 2002 , experts estimate that north korea may have added about six to eight more weapons' worth of plutonium to a fissile material stockpile .
the first nuclear tests conducted by other states have ranged from 9 kt ( pakistan ) to 60 kt , but tests by the united states , china , britain and russia were in the 20kt - range .
the test followed a pattern of north korean provocations and escalations , including the launch of several short - , medium - , and long - range missiles in july 2006 .
on october 9 , 2006 , north korea ( formally the democratic people's republic of korea ) announced it conducted a nuclear test .
both actions would dramatically diminish u.s. security .
several experts have suggested that the nuclear test might have fallen short of the anticipated yield because of imprecise manufacturing .
most experts have correlated the size of the seismic disturbance with a sub - kiloton explosion , raising doubts about the effectiveness of the north korean nuclear weapons design .
after several days of evaluation , u.s. authorities confirmed that the underground explosion was nuclear , but that the test produced a low yield of less than one kiloton .
north korean officials reportedly told russian officials the test of the explosive device would have a range of yield between 5 and 15 kilotons ; another report suggests that north korea told chinese officials they planned to carry out a 4-kiloton test .
by comparison , a simple plutonium implosion device normally would produce a larger blast , perhaps 5 to 20 kilotons .
according to one account , u.s. intelligence estimates that the blast was in the range of 200 tons of tnt , or 0.2 kt .
seismic information available from the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources in south korea indicates that an explosion equivalent to an earthquake measuring a 3.58 magnitude occurred at 10:35 a.m. on october 9 in the vicinity of musudan - ri , north hamgyong province .
the nuclear test by pyongyang has compelled china and south korea to agree to harsher measures , but it is unlikely to alter their ultimate objective of preventing the collapse of north korea .
