while recent changes to dod's acquisition policy held the potential to improve such outcomes , programs have continued to experience significant cost and schedule overruns and performance shortfalls .
over the next several years , dod plans to invest $1.4 trillion in major weapon system programs â€” doubling what it planned to spend on such programs 5 years ago .
continued failure to deliver weapon systems on time and within budget not only delays providing critical capabilities to the warfighter , but results in less funding being available for other dod and federal priorities .
it is not unusual to see cost increases that add up to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars , schedule delays that add up to years , and large and expensive programs being scrapped after years of failing to achieve promised capabilities .
in fiscal year 2006 , the senate armed services committee raised concerns that dod's poor track record with acquisition programs was linked not only to the department's defense acquisition system ( das ) for managing product development , but also to the department's joint capabilities integration and development system ( jcids ) for identifying the warfighters' needs and the planning , programming , budgeting and execution ( ppbe ) process for allocating resources .
in the commercial market , effectively developing and marketing new products is fundamental to the continued growth and success of companies .
dod's programs for acquiring major weapon systems have taken longer , cost more , and delivered fewer quantities and capabilities than planned .
dod has three major processes involved in making weapon system investment decisions .
dod's approach to managing weapon system investments ultimately results in less funding being available for other competing needs in dod as well as other federal priorities , as the expenditure of tax dollars within dod reduces the amount of funding available for those priorities .
without a steady stream of product innovations to meet evolving market needs , companies are likely to see their sales and profits fall .
consequently , the committee directed gao to examine how dod's needs identification and resource allocation processes can better support program stability in major weapon systems acquisition .
several recent studies issued by leading thinkers in the area of product innovation and development have reported that leading commercial companies achieve success in product development by following a disciplined process for ensuring they have the right mix of new products that meet customer needs within available resources .
although the department of defense ( dod ) produces the best weapons in the world , it has not been able to deliver planned systems on time and within budget .
these processes , depicted in figure 1 , are the joint capabilities integration and development system ( jcids ) , for identifying warfighting needs ; the planning , programming , budgeting and execution ( ppbe ) system , for allocating resources ; and the defense acquisition system ( das ) , for managing product development and procurement .
this report ( 1 ) identifies best practices of successful commercial companies for ensuring that they pursue the right mix of programs to meet the needs of their customers within resource constraints and ( 2 ) compares dod's enterprise - level processes for investing in weapon systems to these practices .
