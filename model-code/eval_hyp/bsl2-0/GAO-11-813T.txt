fps's primary responsibilities include ( 1 ) conducting risk assessments of federal facilities and recommending countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents at facilities ; and ( 2 ) undertaking law enforcement activities , including responding to incidents at federal facilities .
as part of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , fps is responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in approximately 9,000 federal facilities owned or leased by the general services administration ( gsa ) .
fps has a budget of approximately $1 billion and maintains approximately 1,200 full - time employees and about 13,000 contract security guards ( also known as protective service officers ) that help accomplish the agency's facility protection mission .
we are pleased to be here to discuss the challenges the federal protective service ( fps ) faces in carrying out its mission to protect federal facilities , particularly with regard to ( 1 ) risk management , ( 2 ) strategic human capital planning , ( 3 ) oversight of its contract guard program , and ( 4 ) ensuring that its fee - based funding structure is the appropriate mechanism for funding the agency .
dhs and fps have generally agreed with these recommendations .
we will also discuss fps's assessment of its performance and the extent to which fps has made progress in responding to these challenges .
in addition , fps officials stated that its progress in implementing our recommendations has been affected by delays in developing several new management systems , such as ramp .
according to fps officials , the agency has faced difficulty in implementing many of our recommendations because of changes in its leadership , organization , funding , and staffing levels .
since 2008 , we have made 28 recommendations to help fps to address its challenges with risk management , strategic human capital planning , oversight of its contract guard workforce , and its fee - based funding structure .
recent events have exposed weaknesses with fps's ability to protect federal facilities , including gao's covert testing at federal facilities in 2009 , fps's ongoing penetration testing at federal facilities , and fps's contract security guards allowing components of an active bomb to remain in a federal building in detroit , michigan , for three weeks in march 2011 before a bomb squad was called .
fps has begun several initiatives that , once fully implemented , should enhance its ability to protect the more than 1 million federal employees and members of the public who visit federal facilities each year .
work conducted for these reports and testimonies included assessing fps's facility protection efforts using our key security practices as a framework .
of the remaining 7 , 5 were recommendations from our may 2011 report , and we would not necessarily expect them to be fully implemented yet .
as of july 2011 , as shown in table 1 , fps was in the process of addressing 21 of them , although none were fully implemented .
fps concurred with our recommendations and states that its efforts to address them will be completed in 2012 when its automated information systems are fully implemented .
we also visited selected fps regions and selected gsa buildings to assess fps activities firsthand .
