medicaid is a significant expenditure for the federal government and the states , with total federal outlays of $310 billion in fiscal year 2014 .
specifically , federal law requires cms to issue regulations to improve medicaid program integrity , with which state medicaid programs must comply .
in february 2015 , we reported that medicaid remains at high risk because of concerns about the adequacy of fiscal oversight of the program , including improper payments to medicaid providers .
in fiscal year 2014 , cms reported an estimated improper payment rate of 6.7 percent , or $17.5 billion for the medicaid program , which is an increase over its 2013 estimate of 5.8 percent , or $14.4 billion .
expanding monitoring efforts to examine these matters in greater depth would provide cms with more - complete information to help determine whether there is a need to issue guidance to address these potential problems more consistently to help ensure greater program integrity and additional cost savings .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for overseeing the medicaid program , including disbursing federal matching funds , and provides guidance , technical assistance , and periodic assessments of state medicaid programs .
automatic refill prohibitions may help limit waste and unnecessary program expenditures .
federal laws prescribe responsibility for both federal and state entities to protect the medicaid program from fraud , waste , and abuse .
specifically , for this review we 1. evaluated the reliability of medicaid data from cms and selected states for the purpose of identifying indicators of potential fraud or abuse ; 2. identified and analyzed indicators , if any , of potentially fraudulent or abusive activities related to prescription drugs in medicaid ; and 3. examined the extent to which federal and selected state oversight policies , controls , and processes are designed to prevent and detect instances of prescription - drug fraud in medicaid .
while most improper payments are not related to fraud , and the full extent to which fraud , waste , and abuse related to prescription drugs affects medicaid is unknown , we have previously identified potentially fraudulent or abusive practices in cms's health - care programs .
medicaid payments to these states constituted about 13 percent of all medicaid payments made during fiscal year 2011 .
to evaluate the reliability of medicaid data from cms and state medicaid programs for our selected states that could be used to identify indicators of potential fraud or abuse , we took several steps .
because of the substantial amount of funds that are expended in the medicaid program and our prior work detailing potential fraudulent or abusive practices , you asked us to review any pharmacy - related program - integrity efforts at selected states .
cms agreed with our recommendations and implemented them .
federal law prohibits medicaid providers and beneficiaries from taking certain actions related to billing for or receiving medicaid services .
cms is responsible for administering legislation and regulations affecting the medicaid program .
these states accounted for about 13 percent of the federal share of fiscal year 2011 medicaid expenditures .
we selected states based on high medicaid beneficiary enrollment , geographic diversity , and availability of data .
