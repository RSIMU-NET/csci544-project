this report examines ( 1 ) funding programs available for property acquisitions , ( 2 ) fema's flood mitigation efforts , and ( 3 ) factors contributing to nfip's fiscal exposure .
while congress cancelled $16 billion of nfip's debt in 2017 , as of march 2020 , nfip still owed treasury $20.5 billion .
these factors have resulted in nfip accruing billions of dollars in debt , as the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) has repeatedly borrowed from the department of the treasury ( treasury ) to pay claims .
as a result , property acquisition can help reduce nfip's fiscal exposure while also reducing flood risk for homeowners .
to review fema's flood mitigation efforts , we analyzed fema hma data to determine how many properties fema helped states and communities to mitigate , and the financial resources fema provided for flood mitigation .
however , questions exist about the cost , efficiency , and effectiveness of this approach .
nfip has been on our high - risk list since 2006 because of its financial and management challenges .
you asked us to evaluate the efficacy of fema's property acquisition efforts as a means of addressing nfip's financial challenges .
to describe funding programs available for property acquisitions , we identified hma programs that fund property acquisition by reviewing fema documentation , legislation , and regulations .
in addition to nfip , fema administers several hazard mitigation assistance ( hma ) grant programs that provide funding to states and localities to mitigate the flood risk of nfip - insured properties and structures , using a variety of methods .
the magnitude of major flood events since 2005 , combined with attempts to keep policyholder rates affordable , have resulted in insufficient premium revenue , which threatens the program's ability to pay claims over the long term .
we analyzed these data by type of mitigation ( acquisition , elevation , floodproof , or relocation ) , grant program , and state .
compounding these challenges is a small subset of nfip - insured properties known as repetitive loss ( rl ) properties , which have flooded and received a claim payment multiple times .
congress created the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) to protect homeowners from flood losses , minimize the exposure of properties to flood damage , and alleviate taxpayers' exposure to flood losses .
in a subsequent report , we plan to assess fema's acquisition process and the extent to which property acquisition is an effective tool for managing nfip's fiscal exposure .
to examine factors contributing to nfip's fiscal exposure , we analyzed fema's claims data set and its list of significant flood events .
further , we reviewed several of our previous reports and treasury's statements of public debt to identify factors that contribute to nfip's fiscal exposure and how the debt has changed over time .
members of congress and others have raised concerns about such reforms because raising premium rates may make coverage unaffordable for some policyholders .
finally , we reviewed available fema , stakeholder , and academic studies on how flood risk has changed over time and estimates of future trends .
