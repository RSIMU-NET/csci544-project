from fiscal years 2015 to 2017 , four federal agencies consistently had the highest annual federal r&d spending: the department of defense ( dod ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and the national institutes of health ( nih ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
the department of commerce ( commerce ) is responsible for government - wide functions related to patenting , including granting patents through the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) .
the federal government spends approximately $137 billion annually on research and development ( r&d ) to help further agencies' missions , including at federal laboratories ( lab ) .
for example , the stevenson - wydler technology innovation act of 1980 ( stevenson - wydler act ) states that its purpose is to improve the economic , environmental , and social well - being of the united states by , among other things , stimulating improved utilization of federally funded technology developments by nonfederal entities .
a series of federal laws and executive orders spanning nearly 40 years have directed federal agencies to enhance their labs' beneficial impact on society through technology transfer .
numerous statutory and regulatory requirements have been established to help ensure that agencies commercialize inventions arising from r&d at federal labs .
together , these four agencies accounted for nearly 90 percent of total federal r&d spending on average , as shown in figure 1 .
commerce is also responsible for functions related to licensing of federally owned inventions , including reporting federal agencies' technology transfer activities to congress and issuing regulations , both of which it delegated to the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) .
one way federal agencies transfer technology is by licensing patents on inventions generated by r&d at federal labs .
accordingly , the act provides that the federal government , where appropriate , shall transfer federally owned or originated technology to state and local governments and to the private sector .
the intellectual property generated by this research — including inventions — has application beyond federal agencies' immediate , mission - related goals if the private sector can bring the inventions to market .
however , a 2013 office of science and technology policy report raised concerns that only a small portion of the inventions arising from government research have been commercialized by the private sector , and that the united states is potentially missing critical opportunities to improve the nation's standard of living , create new jobs , maintain international competitiveness , and enhance the overall economy , among other things .
federal agency and lab officials and external stakeholders have identified challenges across the federal patent licensing process , but nist has not fully reported such challenges .
for example , government research has led to new products and processes for the commercial marketplace , including antibiotics , plastics , airplanes , computers , microwaves , and bioengineered drugs .
specifically , we have reported how the effective implementation of good governance can help address government challenges in five key areas involving agency performance and management: ( 1 ) instituting a more coordinated and crosscutting approach to achieving meaningful results , ( 2 ) focusing on addressing weaknesses in major management functions , ( 3 ) ensuring that agency performance information is useful and used in decision making , ( 4 ) sustaining leadership commitment and accountability for achieving results , and ( 5 ) engaging congress in identifying management and performance issues to address .
