specifically , this report examines the advantages and disadvantages of proposals ( 1 ) to change the role of financial regulators and the department of the treasury in financial company bankruptcies ; ( 2 ) affecting the funding of financial company bankruptcies , and ( 3 ) to change the safe - harbor treatment of certain financial contracts — including derivatives and repurchase agreements .
we focus in this report on the advantages and disadvantages of proposals from experts , government officials , and legislators to change the code to make bankruptcies of financial companies ( especially those that pose systemic risk to the financial system ) more orderly and effective .
ola authorizes the secretary of the treasury to appoint the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) as a receiver when , among other things , the failure of a financial company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states and taking action under ola would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects .
to address these objectives , we reviewed our earlier work under the mandate and that of the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aousc ) and the board of governors of the federal reserve ( federal reserve ) , which have similar mandates .
these criteria included minimizing systemic risk , avoiding fire sales , maximizing value , promoting due process , and limiting taxpayer liability .
the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) mandates that we study , at first annually and then at specified intervals , issues including the effectiveness of the code in facilitating the orderly liquidation or reorganization of financial companies and ways to make the orderly liquidation process under the code for financial companies more effective .
in july 2012 , we issued our second report that addressed actions taken to implement the orderly liquidation authority ( ola ) created by the dodd frank act .
in july 2011 , we issued our first report , which addressed the mandate's requirements and included proposals for revising the code to improve the orderliness and effectiveness of financial company bankruptcies .
the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the failures of large , complex financial companies led some experts to question the adequacy of the u. s. bankruptcy code ( code ) for effectively reorganizing or liquidating these companies without causing further harm to the financial system .
questions raised about the effectiveness of the code have prompted some financial and legal experts — sometimes working in interdisciplinary groups — as well as government officials and members of congress to propose changes to the code , or to the supervisory process leading to a bankruptcy filing .
roundtable participants discussed the proposals in relation to the criteria of orderliness and effectiveness , potential outcomes of implementing the proposals , and how impediments to implementing them might be overcome .
we relied on criteria for orderly and effective bankruptcies that were developed during our earlier work .
for this engagement we reviewed more recent literature to update the proposals we earlier identified for modifying the code .
during our work , we also met with officials from aousc , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , fdic , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) , financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) , u.s. department of justice , national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , and u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) .
