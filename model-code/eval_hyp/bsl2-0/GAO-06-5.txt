moreover , various pieces of federal and state legislation have been introduced , such as bills to restrict the offshoring of some government services or to provide more assistance for displaced workers .
this has contributed to heightened public debate about both the potential benefits of services offshoring , such as lower consumer prices and higher u.s. productivity , as well as the potential costs , such as increased job displacement for u.s. workers .
services offshoring raises issues on a wide array of topics , including the economy , workforce , consumer privacy , and national security .
in response to widespread congressional interest , we have prepared this report under the comptroller general's authority to help the congress understand and examine the potential impacts and policy implications of services offshoring .
while u.s. government data have limitations , these data indicate that in recent years the imports of services associated with offshoring have been growing .
as this report may prove helpful in the deliberations of committees with oversight responsibilities or jurisdiction over issues raised by offshoring , we have addressed this report to these committees .
although this report focuses on services offshoring , much of our discussion is applicable to offshoring in the manufacturing sector as well .
for example , u.s. companies are now able to move software programming , accounting , or telephone call center services to lower - wage locations such as india , the philippines , and eastern europe .
this report addresses three broad areas .
we generally categorize policy proposals on the basis of the broad concerns that they seek to address , and we provide illustrative examples of policies that have been proposed .
advances in information technology ( it ) and developments in the management of business processes , coupled with a large pool of educated workers in other countries , allow companies to move services work outside of the u.s. as part of a larger trend toward global interdependence .
however , the report does not attempt to resolve such differences in views .
second , the report provides an overview of the various types of policies that have been proposed in response to offshoring .
third , the report highlights some key areas where additional research might advance the debate about the effects and policy implications of offshoring .
first , it provides an overview of experts' views on the potential effects of offshoring .
offshoring generally refers to the practice , by either u.s. companies or government entities , of replacing goods or services previously produced domestically with goods and services produced abroad .
where experts express different opinions on the potential effects of offshoring , we highlight the key issues that underlie the debate .
although “offshoring” has existed for decades in the manufacturing sector , recently concerns have been raised about the emergence of services offshoring .
where possible , we identify empirical research that provides support for various views .
our discussion identifies some relevant data sources and potential approaches for such research .
while such research faces numerous challenges and limitations , it offers some prospect for additional insights on diverse aspects of services offshoring .
we have highlighted some key areas where further research might help advance the debate about the impacts and policy implications of offshoring .
