that should strengthen its standards for and oversight of states' complaint practices and improve the deterrent effect of enforcement actions , including the use of fines and terminations .
the threat of sanctions appeared to have little effect on deterring homes from falling out of compliance because homes could continue to avoid the sanctions' effect as long as they temporarily corrected their deficiencies .
further , regarding enforcement actions , hcfa has not yet realized its main goal â€” to help ensure that homes maintain compliance with federal health care standards .
on the existence of serious deficiencies in nursing home compliance with medicare and medicaid standards .
the federal government has the authority to impose sanctions , such as fines , if homes are found not to meet these standards .
in most cases , sanctions initiated by hcfa never took effect .
on the basis of statutory requirements , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) defines standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs and contracts with states to certify that homes meet these standards through annual inspections and complaint investigations .
last week , the administrator generally concurred with these recommendations and announced new initiatives to address these issues .
we are also recommending that hcfa improve its management information systems to more completely include complaint investigation results and to be able to more effectively identify and respond to homes with recurring problems .
as a result , allegations or incidents of serious problems , such as inadequate prevention of pressure sores , failure to prevent accidents , and failure to assess residents' needs and provide appropriate care , often go uninvestigated and uncorrected .
although most homes corrected deficiencies identified in an initial survey , 40 percent of these homes with serious deficiencies were repeat violators .
further , we assess hcfa's use of sanction authority for homes that failed to maintain compliance with these standards .
the federal government , which will pay nearly $39 billion for nursing home care in 1999 , plays a major role in ensuring that residents receive adequate quality of care .
our work in selected states revealed that , for serious complaints alleging harm to residents , the combination of inadequate state practices and limited hcfa guidance and oversight have often resulted in policies or practices that may limit the number of complaints filed , serious complaints alleging harmful situations not being investigated promptly , and incomplete reporting on nursing homes' compliance history and states' complaint investigation performance .
more than one - fourth of the more than 17,000 nursing homes nationwide had serious deficiencies that caused actual harm to residents or placed them at risk of death or serious injury .
in brief , we found that neither complaint investigations nor enforcement practices are being used effectively to ensure adequate care for nursing home residents .
they frequently depend on extensive assistance in the basic activities of daily living such as dressing , grooming , feeding , and using the bathroom , and many require skilled nursing or rehabilitative care .
the nearly 1.6 million elderly and disabled residents living in nursing homes are among the sickest and most vulnerable populations in the nation .
we found that too often a yo - yo pattern develops in which homes cycle in and out of compliance .
