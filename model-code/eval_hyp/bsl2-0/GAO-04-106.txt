va's hepatitis c screening performance result for fiscal year 2002 was 85 percent , a significant improvement from its baseline result of 51 percent in fiscal year 2001 .
va established its fiscal year 2002 national hepatitis c testing performance goal at 55 percent .
this initiative represents a major undertaking for va , which provided health care services to approximately 4.7 million veterans and identified over 180,000 veterans with hepatitis c infections in fiscal year 2002 .
as a result , you asked us to focus our work on testing performance and we ( 1 ) reviewed va's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results in testing veterans it identified as at risk for hepatitis c , ( 2 ) identified factors that impede va's efforts to test veterans for hepatitis c in one va health care network , and ( 3 ) identified actions taken by va networks and medical facilities intended to improve the testing rate of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis c. we reviewed va's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement process results in testing veterans it identified as at risk for hepatitis c , the most recently available data at the time we conducted our work .
to be included in the hepatitis c testing performance measure , the veteran does not have to have been tested in fiscal year 2002 ; testing may have occurred in a prior fiscal year .
as a result , va implemented a hepatitis c screening and testing process and , in fiscal year 2002 , included both screening and testing of veterans for hepatitis c in its performance measurement system .
specifically , to assess va's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results , we compared va's national and individual network performance results for testing veterans in fiscal year 2002 or earlier against va's national goal and analyzed va's method for calculating performance results .
for the veterans' medical records to be included in the performance measurement sample , veterans must have been enrolled to receive va health care for 2 continuous years and been seen at least once during the current fiscal year in one of va's primary care clinics .
hepatitis c is a chronic disease caused by a blood - borne virus that can lead to potentially fatal liver - related conditions .
we concluded and va agreed that for va to identify undiagnosed veterans , it would need to establish early detection as a standard of care and hold managers accountable for the testing of identified at - risk veterans who receive care in va's outpatient clinics .
in addition , we looked at one va health care network's testing rate for at - risk veterans visiting its clinics in fiscal year 2002 .
in june 2001 , we testified before your subcommittee that va was not conducting hepatitis c risk factor screening for about 80 percent of veterans making outpatient clinic visits to va facilities and not testing , on average , about half of the veterans it identified with at least one risk factor at four va facilities we visited .
va's hepatitis c screening and testing performance is measured by reviewing a sample of veterans' medical records to determine the percentage of veterans screened against a list of risk factors for the disease and the percentage of at - risk veterans who are subsequently tested .
