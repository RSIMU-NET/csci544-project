105-33 ) , almost $40 billion over the next 10 years to help states expand insurance coverage to more children , through either medicaid or other health plans .
in response to concerns about the millions of uninsured children , the congress has allotted , through the balanced budget act ( p.l .
now states are considering how much of their funding they will contribute to match this federal investment in children's health care and how they can best implement an expansion of coverage .
however , some question the extent to which children need coverage and whether an expansion of coverage would appreciably affect children's access to health care .
in light of these events , you asked us to determine what effect health insurance has on children's access to health care , whether expanding publicly funded insurance improves their access , and what barriers besides lack of insurance might deter children from getting health care .
many experts believe that the lack of health insurance discourages families from seeking preventive and other needed care for their children .
in addition , while insurance may influence children's access to care , a number of other factors , such as their family income or their ethnicity , also influence their health care use .
access is the ability to obtain preventive or acute care and cannot be measured directly .
the number of children who lack health insurance has increased since the late 1980s , so that , in 1996 , nearly 10.6 million children were uninsured .
therefore , most studies measure access in one of several ways â€” by how families adhere to a recommended schedule for preventive care , whether they can identify a source of care , their use of health care , or their self - reported access problems .
as we agreed with your office , we analyzed evaluations published during the past 10 years on the relationship between health insurance and health care access .
we focused on studies that attempted to control for such factors .
the evaluations and our analysis of them have several limitations .
therefore , some researchers have analyzed specific types of use by recommended schedules , such as children's making at least one visit to a physician every year .
looking at use cannot by itself distinguish appropriate from inappropriate use .
because we reviewed articles published over the past 10 years , generally based on analyses of large national surveys , most of the studies analyzed data collected in the late 1980s .
currently about 15.5 million ( 22 percent ) of children younger than 18 are covered through medicaid .
we did our work between june and october 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
public health insurance for children is generally provided through the medicaid program .
yet uninsured adolescents also have access problems .
however , the similarity of findings from analyses of surveys done at different times suggests that findings from earlier surveys still apply .
some children have health insurance whose deductibles and cost - sharing are unaffordable .
overcoming these kinds of barriers would require that children be more continuously covered by health insurance so that they could develop long - term relationships with primary care providers .
