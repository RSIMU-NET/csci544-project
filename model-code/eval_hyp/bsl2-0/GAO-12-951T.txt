dod concurred with our recommendations and has taken some actions to implement them .
to support its development , the united states has allocated $43 billion to train , equip , and sustain ansf from fiscal years 2002 to 2011 , appropriated $11.2 billion in fiscal year 2012 , and requested about $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2013 .
dod has also reported these ministries face challenges , such as lack of expertise in human capital and problems with corruption .
gao has made recommendations to address these challenges , including addressing shortages of trainers .
given the key role of advising teams in supporting the transition process , these areas will be important considerations for dod as it continues to refine its plans for forming , deploying , and using advisor personnel to mentor and develop the ansf .
we found that brigades in afghanistan sometimes faced challenges providing the necessary support to advisor teams such as transportation assets , force protection resources , and equipment because support requirements had not always been clearly identified , these items and capabilities were in limited supply and were , at times , also needed to support combat operations .
we made several recommendations to dod to enhance the department's ability to support the advising mission , including clearly defining the requirements for the number , ranks , and capabilities of advisors , the relative priority of the advising mission , and the support that advisor teams require .
the department of defense ( dod ) and the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) report progress developing capable afghan national security forces ( ansf ) , but tools used to assess the performance of ansf units have changed several times .
addressing such gaps is necessary to reduce ansf reliance on coalition support .
gao is not making new recommendations but has made numerous recommendations in prior reports aimed at improving efforts to develop ansf capabilities .
since gao made its recommendations , additional trainers have deployed to afghanistan .
dod and nato report progress in developing capable ansf .
to that end , earlier this year , the united states and coalition nations have begun providing specialized teams , referred to as security force assistance advisory teams ( sfaats ) , to provide leadership and expertise to ansf personnel and units .
according to nato , a successful security transition requires ansf capable of addressing security challenges in afghanistan .
second , shortfalls in leadership and logistics capabilities in ansf persist .
to support this effort , the united states allocated $43 billion to build , train , equip , and sustain ansf from fiscal year 2002 to 2011 , with an additional $11.2 billion appropriated in fiscal year 2012 and approximately $5.8 billion requested by the u.s. department of defense ( dod ) for fiscal year 2013 .
provision of support to advisor teams .
as part of the overall transition of lead security responsibility to the ansf by 2014 , nato's mission in afghanistan is shifting from a combat role to more of an advising and assist mission .
we found that units in afghanistan faced some challenges because commanders did not always set clear priorities between the advising mission and other operational requirements , such as counterinsurgency operations or performing missions such as conducting checkpoints .
