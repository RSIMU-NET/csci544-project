second , the administration and the congress should consider legislation to allow agencies more flexibility and give them new tools to attract , retain , and motivate employees â€” both overall and in critical occupations such as those in it .
this is especially true in the information technology ( it ) area , where widespread shortfalls in human capital have contributed to shortfalls in agency and program performance .
capital needs issued by the national academy of public administration ; and highlight some important challenges that must be addressed in moving it human capital reform from proposals to implementation .
third , all interested parties should work together to determine further , possibly more comprehensive human capital reforms .
first , in the near term , agencies can improve their human capital management by taking advantage of the authorities already available to them under current laws and regulations .
few management tasks facing federal agencies are more critical to their ability to serve the nation than attracting , retaining , and motivating people .
in previous testimony , we have presented our recommended three - stage approach to human capital reform .
because people create knowledge and put it to practical use , the success or failure of federal agencies , like that of other organizations , depends on having the right number of people with the right mix of knowledge and skills .

i appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you this afternoon the federal government's strategic management challenges in the area of human capital , particularly regarding the information technology workforce .
performance shortfalls .
implementing reforms in human capital management will present significant challenges .
overcoming such problems requires overcoming the barriers that result from an entrenched organizational culture .
cultural issues have also been linked to long - standing security problems at department of energy weapons laboratories , and to intractable waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement problems in the social security administration's high - risk supplemental security income program .
these elements are ( 1 ) a demonstrated leadership commitment and accountability for change ; ( 2 ) the integration of management improvement initiatives into programmatic decisionmaking ; ( 3 ) thoughtful and rigorous planning to guide decisions , particularly to address human capital and information technology issues ; ( 4 ) employee involvement to elicit ideas and build commitment and accountability ; ( 5 ) transforming organizational culture and aligning organizations to streamline operations and clarify accountability ; and ( 6 ) strong and continuing congressional involvement .
capital strategies are not appropriate to meet the needs of the nation's government and its citizens .
innovation and flexibility in human capital management , as well as continual efforts to capture data not only on employee performance , but also on the effectiveness of agencies' efforts at human capital management .
this substantial investment should provide opportunities for increasing productivity and decreasing costs .
another critical challenge for implementing any reform is addressing needed changes in prevailing organizational cultures .
congress has opportunities available through its confirmation , oversight and appropriations , and legislative roles to ensure that agencies recognize their responsibilities and have the needed tools to manage their people for results .
