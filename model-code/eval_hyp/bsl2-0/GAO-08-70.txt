however , dod has adopted its own framework for assessment and accountability .
to support students with dyslexia in dod schools through professional development of teachers and staff , the conference committee for defense appropriations designated $3.2 million in funding for fiscal years 2004-to - 2006 .
while dod has broad authority to use these funds for general operations and maintenance expenses , your committee expressed interest in whether and how dod provides support to students with dyslexia .
in response to these questions , we examined: ( 1 ) what professional development dod provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and how the fiscal years 2004-to - 2006 funds designated for this purpose were used , ( 2 ) what identification and instructional services dod provides to students who may have dyslexia , and ( 3 ) how dod assesses the academic achievement of students with disabilities , including dyslexia .
dod schools are subject to many of the same requirements that apply to public schools under the individuals with disabilities education improvement act of 2004 ( ideia ) , such as the requirement that they provide a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities , but are not subject to the requirements of the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ) .
we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and agency guidance and also obtained information on dod's obligation and disbursement of funds designated for professional development on dyslexia .
we obtained several agency reports including: a 2007 report to congress on dod's efforts to assist students with dyslexia and a 2005 survey of dod special education personnel .
through the department of defense education activity , dod serves about 90,000 students in 208 schools worldwide and provides a full range of educational services to its students , including supplemental reading programs for struggling readers and special education services for children with disabilities .
the children of many of our nation's military and civilian personnel overseas and on certain military bases in the united states depend on the department of defense ( dod ) schools to meet their educational needs — from prekindergarten through 12th grade .
to meet these objectives , we obtained documentation from dod , conducted a web - based survey of all 208 dod school principals , visited or interviewed by phone officials and parents in six school districts , and interviewed agency officials and representatives of education organizations .
some students who struggle to read may have a condition referred to as dyslexia , a brain - based learning disability that impedes a person's ability to read .
we selected 6 of dod's 12 school districts , 2 from each area , using the following criteria: ( 1 ) geographic dispersion , ( 2 ) representation of all military service branches , ( 3 ) variety of primary and secondary schools , and ( 4 ) range in the proportion of students receiving special education services .
we visited school officials and parents of struggling readers in two of the three areas ( the americas and europe ) overseen by the department of defense education activity .
for our web - based survey of all dod school principals , we received completed surveys from 175 — an 84 percent response rate .
