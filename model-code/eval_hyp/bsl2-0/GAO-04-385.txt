many changes have since been made to strengthen aviation security and reduce opportunities for terrorists to hijack or destroy commercial aircraft .
as agreed to with the house and senate committees on appropriations ; the senate committee on commerce , science and transportation ; the house committee on transportation and infrastructure ; and the house subcommittee on technology , information policy , intergovernmental relations and the census we assessed the development status and plans for capps ii , status of capps ii in addressing the program challenges identified in public law 108-90 , and additional challenges that pose major risks to the development and implementation of the system .
we were requested by the chairman , house committee on transportation and infrastructure ; the chairman , subcommittee on technology , information policy , intergovernmental relations and the census , house committee on government reform ; and mandated by public law 108-90 to assess aspects of the system's development , including safeguards put in place to protect the traveling public's privacy .
the security of our nation's commercial aviation system has been a long - standing concern , and for over 30 years , substantial efforts have been undertaken to strengthen it .
however , as recent flight cancellations and other events from december 2003 through february 2004 have shown , the threat of terrorist attempts to use commercial aircraft to inflict casualties and damage remains .
these higher - risk passengers and their baggage are subject to additional and more thorough screening .
in response to the events of september 11 , 2001 , and the requirement set forth in the aviation and transportation security act that a computer - assisted passenger prescreening system be used to evaluate all passengers , the transportation security administration's ( tsa ) office of national risk assessment is developing capps ii .
the development of capps ii raises a number of concerns , including whether individuals may be inappropriately targeted by the system for additional screening , and whether data accessed by the system may compromise the privacy of the traveling public .
unlike the current computer - assisted passenger prescreening system ( capps ) that operates on airlines' reservation systems , capps ii will be operated by tsa .
to address these objectives , we reviewed relevant capps ii program documentation on the status of the program's development as of january 1 , 2004 , and interviewed agency officials , air carrier personnel , commercial data providers , and privacy advocacy organizations to discuss the system's development , its anticipated operations , and challenges to its implementation .
one of the efforts underway to address this task and strengthen aviation security is the development of a new computer - assisted passenger prescreening system that is known as capps ii .
with thousands of daily flights carrying millions of passengers , ensuring that no passenger poses a threat to commercial aviation remains a daunting task .
however , the tragic events of september 11 , 2001 — which began with the hijacking of four commercial aircraft — showed that weaknesses in commercial aviation security continued to exist .
