within the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) , the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) and fra are the two federal agencies primarily responsible for improving and overseeing safety at public grade crossings .
as part of this evaluation , fhwa should determine whether statutory changes to the program are necessary to improve its effectiveness .
fra also awards safety discretionary grants to states , local governments , and other public entities to address rail planning , infrastructure , and safety issues .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
the persistence of crashes and deaths raises questions as to whether improvements could be made to increase the effectiveness of fra's rail - safety oversight activities and states' use of federal grade - crossing safety improvement funds .
fhwa has oversight responsibilities regarding the use of federal funds as part of its administration of federal - aid highway programs and funding , including hsip funds .
the administrator of fhwa , working with fra , should evaluate the section 130 program's requirements to determine whether they allow states sufficient flexibility to adequately address current and emerging grade - crossing safety issues .
fhwa's railway - highway crossings program ( commonly referred to as the section 130 program ) is the primary federal program for providing states , through a statutory formula , funding to address safety at grade crossings .
the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects , and the extent to which fhwa assesses the program's effectiveness .
however , fra expects future crashes to grow , in part , because of the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic .
while these grants are not specifically targeted for grade - crossing safety , they may include improvements to rail - highway crossing safety .
according to the federal railroad administration's ( fra ) data , since fra began measuring in 1975 , crashes at grade crossings have declined by over 80 percent and fatalities have dropped 70 percent .
fra oversees railroad safety , including the safety of rail operations at grade crossings .
federal investments in grade - crossing safety improvement have noticeably reduced the number of deaths and injuries at public grade crossings .
crashes have leveled off in recent years , and since 2009 , the number of grade - crossing crashes and fatalities has hovered at around 2,100 crashes and 250 fatalities per year .
we also reviewed federal laws and guidance related to implementing projects and measuring performance .
fra's new grade - crossing inspectors are meant to increase the effectiveness of fra's rail - safety oversight activities , and accordingly , these fra inspectors , along with fra researchers , may be well positioned to help fhwa evaluate potential changes to improve the effectiveness of the section 130 program .
we also reviewed fhwa's summary of fiscal year 2018 program funds provided to states and federal laws and guidance related to implementing projects and measuring performance .
how states select and implement grade - crossing projects , and what railroad - and state - reported data are available from fra to inform states' decisions .
fhwa uses a statutory formula to distribute to states section 130 program funds , which averaged $235 million per year during the last 10 years ( fiscal years 2009 through 2018 ) .
