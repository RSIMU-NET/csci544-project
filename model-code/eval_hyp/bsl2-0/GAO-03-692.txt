during fiscal year 2002 , bia's budget for operating , maintaining , constructing , and repairing its school facilities was nearly $348 million .
recognizing the need to address these concerns , bia is now in its third year of implementing a new facilities management information system ( fmis ) to replace its old information system .
as a result , bia did not have accurate and complete information to determine how much annual funding is needed at each school site for heating , lighting , and other operating expenses , as well as how much current and future funding is needed at each site for making repairs and capital improvements , such as patching a roof or upgrading a fire alarm system .
to maintain the integrity of these data over time , bia also introduced various quality control measures for helping ensure that facility management staff would accurately enter new data into fmis .
after discussions with cognizant congressional committees and several indian education organizations about the information that would be most helpful , we focused our efforts on ( 1 ) whether bia's new facilities management information system addresses the former system's shortcomings and meets bia's needs for managing school facilities ; ( 2 ) the status of bia's effort to validate the accuracy and completeness of the data being transferred from the old system into fmis ; and ( 3 ) how well bia's quality control measures are working to ensure that new data entered into fmis are accurate and complete .
tribal indian education organizations and bia have had longstanding concerns that the information system was inadequate for managing school facilities and did not accurately reflect how many buildings are in good condition or disrepair .
for many years , bia and tribal employees have been tracking the condition of their school facilities using an automated information system .
prior to implementing fmis , however , and to ensure that this new system met bia's management needs , bia hired a consulting firm to identify weaknesses with the old system and recommend improvements for designing a new one .
because of concerns about the quality of the data in the former system , the congress directed us to conduct a review in this area .
the bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) , which is responsible for ensuring that over 48,000 indian students have school facilities that provide them with a safe and quality place to learn , works with indian tribes to operate and maintain nearly 2,200 buildings at 171 elementary and secondary schools .
once the new system was designed and bia was prepared to implement it , bia hired an engineering firm to validate all of the data to be transferred from the old system into fmis to ensure that the data were accurate and complete .
to conduct our review of bia's new information system , we reviewed the studies that evaluated bia's old information system and determined the extent that bia's new system implements recommendations .
we also interviewed officials from bia's office of facilities management and construction , division of safety and risk management , and office of indian education programs , as well as officials from various indian education organizations .
