in fiscal year 2011 , va provided health care services to about 6.2 million veterans through its veterans health administration ( vha ) , which consists of 153 medical in fiscal year 2011 , vha centers across 21 health care networks.employed about 255,000 staff members at various levels including managers , clinicians , and administrative staff .
aib investigations are important tools , as their results ( evidence , findings , conclusions , and recommendations ) may be used to inform corrective actions , whether individual disciplinary actions for employee misconduct , or broader policy or procedural changes in cases of identified systemic deficiencies.identify potential areas for improvement .
aib investigations that do not adequately address critical issues , or that reach findings , conclusions , or recommendations not supported by the evidence , are an ineffective use of resources and may also adversely affect va's operations and systems , including the quality of care provided in its medical centers ; the morale of its employees ; and its public image .
aib investigations may be convened throughout va , including its medical centers , networks , and headquarters .
for matters of alleged employee misconduct or potential systemic deficiencies related to va policies or procedures , va may use an administrative investigation board ( aib ) as a tool to collect evidence and determine the facts surrounding the matter being investigated .
these investigations may focus on alleged individual employee misconduct by any va staff member , regardless of level .
in this report , we focused on aib investigations conducted in vha , and examined: ( 1 ) the process va uses to convene and conduct aib investigations , ( 2 ) the extent to which va collects data on aib investigations , and ( 3 ) how va has used the results of its aib investigations .
during fiscal years 2009 through 2011 , vha conducted more than 1,100 aib investigations , yet the lack of such information from aib investigations may result in missed opportunities for va to gauge the extent to which deficiencies occur throughout its medical centers and networks to prevent escalation of problems , and to take timely corrective action , when needed .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation .
because of the potential implications for va staff and systems , it is critical for aibs to be convened and conducted appropriately .
such missed opportunities come with a cost when information from these investigations is not used to improve the quality and efficiency of vha operations , including the delivery of care to veterans .
you expressed interest in va's aib investigations , including the number of investigations and their results .
for example , related to issues of apart from aib investigations , va uses other tools to patient safety , va uses root cause analysis â€” a methodology for identifying the basic or contributing factors that underlie variations in the performance of systems and processes .
however , va neither collects nor analyzes aggregate data on aib investigations nor does it routinely share information about systemic deficiencies identified or corrective actions taken to improve vha operations and services .
additionally , we reviewed va - wide policy and procedures for taking disciplinary actions , and specific va policy and procedures for taking corrective actions against staff involved in research misconduct .
