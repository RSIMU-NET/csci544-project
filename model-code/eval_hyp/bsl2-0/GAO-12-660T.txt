my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) how faa uses data to manage safety risks , ( 2 ) how faa ensures it has quality data to manage risk , and ( 3 ) the challenges faa faces in using data to better manage safety risks .
in 2010 , congress passed the airline safety and federal aviation administration extension act ( airline safety act ) , which , in part , called for faa to better manage safety risks .
as a result , faa developed a concerted strategy to implement new safety programs required by the airline safety act , including establishing better processes for managing safety risks and advancing safety management systems ( sms ) .
such as the status of our recommendations and programs or initiatives faa planned to implement â€” as necessary during march and april 2012 .
see gao , aviation safety: improved data quality and analysis capabilities are needed as faa plans a risk - based approach to safety oversight , gao - 10-414 ( washington , d.c.: may 6 , 2010 ) ; aviation safety: enhanced oversight and improved availability of risk - based data could further improve safety , gao - 12-24 ( washington , d.c.: oct. 5 , 2011 ) ; initial pilot training: better management controls are needed to improve faa oversight , gao - 12-117 ( washington , d.c.: nov. 4 , 2011 ) ; and aviation safety: faa has an opportunity to enhance safety and improve oversight of initial pilot training , gao - 12-537t ( washington , d.c.: mar .
in response to this accident , and national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) findings that pilot training and lack of qualifications were potentially contributing factors , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) began a call to action plan in june 2009 to , among other things , increase air carrier participation in voluntary safety programs .
this applies to both internal faa operations and external aviation industry organizations .
sms is becoming a worldwide standard throughout the aviation industry , and sms concepts have generated widespread support as an effective approach that can deliver safety benefits .
20 , 2012 ) .
sms is an integrated , data - driven approach to managing safety risk that involves establishing the necessary organizational structures , accountabilities , policies , and procedures to enhance safety .
the implementation of sms heightens the importance of obtaining and using high - quality aviation safety data .
the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) , of which the u.s. is a member state , requires sms for the management of safety risk in air operations , maintenance , air traffic services , and airports .
sms introduces an evolutionary structured process in system safety and safety management that obligates organizations to manage safety with the same level of priority that other core business processes are managed .
further , according to a 2008 independent review team chartered by the secretary of transportation,accidents have become increasingly rare , information that can be used to help identify accident and incident precursors has become more critical for accident prevention .
this statement is based on our previous work , including our may 2010 report on aviation data quality , our october 2011 report on terminal area safety , and our november 2011 report and march 2012 statement for the record on initial pilot training .
