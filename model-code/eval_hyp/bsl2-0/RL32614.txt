finally , a continuing resolution may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year .
alternatively , continuing resolutions may have a longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections , or through the beginning of the next congressional session .
continuing appropriations acts ( commonly known as continuing resolutions or crs ) , which provide interim funding in the event that regular appropriations have not been enacted , have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades .
this report provides information on congressional practices with respect to the duration of continuing resolutions , including the use of full - year measures , and focuses particularly on the period covering fy1998-fy2012 .
continuing resolutions may have a relatively short duration , based on the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks .
whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations acts for a fiscal year is incomplete , an issue that arises is the appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used .
while the average number of such measures enacted per year was about 6 ( 6.1 ) , the actual number enacted ranged from 2 measures ( for fy2009 and fy2010 ) to 21 ( for fy2001 ) .
no continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years , but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose funding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts .
continuing appropriations acts commonly are referred to as continuing resolutions ( or crs ) because usually they provide continuing appropriations in the form of a joint resolution rather than a bill .
over the past half century , the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts have varied considerably , but tardy enactment has been a recurring problem .
when action on the regular appropriations acts is delayed , congress may use one or more continuing appropriations acts to provide stop - gap funding .
occasionally , however , continuing appropriations are provided in bill form .
during these last 15 fiscal years , congress provided funding by means of a continuing resolution for an average of over four months ( 126.6 days ) each fiscal year .
continuing resolutions may be designated by their order ( e.g. , first continuing resolution , second continuing resolution ) or , after the initial continuing resolution has been enacted , designated merely as a further continuing resolution .
in an effort to reduce the reliance on continuing resolutions , the congressional budget act of 1974 ( p.l .
297 ) effectively lengthened the time available for congress to act on annual appropriations measures by moving the start of the fiscal year from july 1 to october 1 .
if a funding gap occurs , federal agencies are typically required to begin a "shutdown" of the affected projects and activities , which includes the prompt furlough of non - excepted personnel .
in most of the years in which continuing resolutions have been used , a series of two or more have been enacted into law .
in the absence of regular appropriations , the failure to enact continuing appropriations in a timely manner results in a funding gap .
