these injuries often require comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services to address complex cognitive and physical impairments .
in addition to their physical injuries , oef / oif servicemembers who have been injured in combat may also be at risk for developing mental health impairments , such as post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , which research has shown to be strongly associated with experiencing intense and prolonged combat .
on march 1 , 2007 , the department of defense ( dod ) reported that over 24,000 servicemembers have been wounded in action since the onset of the two conflicts .
our work has shown that servicemembers injured in combat face an array of significant medical and financial challenges as they begin their recovery process in the dod and va health care systems .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss health care and other services for u.s. military servicemembers wounded during operation enduring freedom ( oef ) or operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) .
specifically , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the transition of care for seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers — those with traumatic brain injuries or other complex trauma , such as missing limbs — who are transferred between dod and va medical facilities ; ( 2 ) dod's and va's efforts to provide early intervention for rehabilitation services as soon as possible after the onset of a disability for seriously injured servicemembers ; ( 3 ) dod's efforts to screen oef / oif servicemembers at risk for ptsd and whether va can meet the demand for ptsd services ; and ( 4 ) the impact of problems related to military pay on injured servicemembers and their families .
more recently , dod estimated in 2006 that as many as 28 percent of those injured by blasts and fragments have some degree of trauma to the brain .
in 2005 , dod reported that about 65 percent of the oef and oif servicemembers wounded in action were injured by blasts and fragments from improvised explosive devices , land mines , and other explosive devices .
for some , this has led to significant gaps in pay and health insurance , which has created financial hardships for these servicemembers and their families .
in light of these challenges and recent media reports that have highlighted unsanitary and decrepit living conditions at the walter reed army medical center , you asked us to discuss concerns we have identified regarding dod and va efforts to provide medical care and rehabilitative services for servicemembers who have been injured during oef and oif .
debt collection actions created additional hardships on servicemembers by preventing them from getting loans to buy houses or automobiles or pay off other debt , and sending several servicemembers into financial crisis .
while servicemembers are on active duty , dod decides where they receive their care — at a military treatment facility ( mtf ) , from a tricare civilian provider , or at a department of veterans affairs ( va ) medical facility .
in summary , dod and va have made various efforts to provide medical care and rehabilitative services for oef / oif servicemembers .
while many servicemembers who receive such rehabilitative services return to active duty after they are treated , others who are more seriously injured are likely to be discharged from their military obligations and return to civilian life with disabilities .
