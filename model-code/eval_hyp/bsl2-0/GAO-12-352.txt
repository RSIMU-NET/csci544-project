these projects involve navigation and flood control activities , environmental restoration , and emergency response — most recently including emergency response to missouri river flooding and rebuilding after hurricane katrina .
six of these centers are focused on the quality and effectiveness of water resources planning and are referred to as “planning centers of expertise.” through its civil works projects , the corps provides vital public engineering services in peace and war to strengthen the nation's security , energize the economy , and reduce risks from disasters .
such studies can span the full range of corps civil works projects , and can include those that are small and low impact and others that are large and complex , with potentially significant economic and environmental impacts .
these projects aim to provide safe and reliable waterways ; reduce risk to people , homes , and communities from flooding and coastal storms ; restore and protect the environment ; and address water resources challenges .
similar findings have been documented in reviews by the national academy of sciences ( nas ) and other organizations , which concluded that the corps' review processes needed to be strengthened .
technical errors in past studies of corps projects , however , had raised concerns about the effectiveness of the corps' internal review processes and the quality of the studies that the corps used as a basis for its civil works projects .
we also reported that these corps studies in the wake of these reports , congress passed section 2034 of the water resources development act ( wrda ) of 2007 , which requires that studies for certain corps projects undergo independent peer review .
this report examines ( 1 ) the number of corps project studies that have undergone independent external peer review in response to section 2034 , ( 2 ) the cost of these peer reviews , ( 3 ) the extent to which the corps' process for determining if a project study is subject to peer review is consistent with section 2034 , ( 4 ) the process the corps uses to ensure that the contractors it hires and the experts the contractors select to review project studies are independent and free from conflicts of interest , and ( 5 ) the extent to which peer review recommendations have been incorporated into project studies .
for example , in march 2006 , we reported that certain studies completed by the corps from 1992 through 2002 were fraught with errors , mistakes , and miscalculations and used invalid assumptions and outdated data.understated costs , overstated benefits , and did not provide a reasonable basis for decision making .
through its civil works program , the corps operates 50 centers of expertise and seven research laboratories that assist its eight divisions and 38 district offices in the planning , design , and technical review of civil works projects .
through its civil works program , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) constructs , operates , and maintains thousands of civil works projects related to water resources across the united states .
you asked us to review the efforts the corps has made to implement and comply with the independent peer review requirements in section 2034 of wrda 2007 .
