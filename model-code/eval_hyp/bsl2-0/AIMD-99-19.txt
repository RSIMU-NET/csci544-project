corrective actions are important because problem disbursements can increase the risks of ( 1 ) fraudulent or erroneous payments being made without detection , ( 2 ) cumulative amounts of disbursements exceeding appropriated amounts and other legal spending limits , and ( 3 ) inaccurate and unreliable financial reporting .
our reports also provided recommendations for needed actions to begin to address these problems .
our previous reports on dod's problem disbursements , listed at the end of this report , detailed long - standing concerns in this area , such as the failure to identify the root causes of dod's disbursing problems and therefore determine which of its numerous initiatives will improve the problem areas .
the defense finance and accounting service ( dfas ) reported that the navy's problem in - transit transactions totaled $3.6 billion as of october 1997 , accounting for 25 percent of the navy's problem disbursements as of that date .
in addition , our march 1996 report on the navy's fiscal year 1994 financial reports stated that errors in recording billions of dollars of navy disbursements resulted in the department of the treasury understating by at least $4 billion the federal government's overall budget deficit reported as of june 30 , 1995 .
problem disbursements result from the difficulties in properly recording transactions , including matching disbursements with related obligations , well after the transactions have occurred .
for example , we previously reportedthat the army's budget execution information could not be relied on to ensure that the army complied with disbursement limits established by the antideficiency act .
we performed this work under the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act as part of our broad - based review of issues affecting the accuracy and completeness of dod's financial information .
the ability to match disbursements with corresponding obligations is a basic funds control requirement .
as we have previously reported , the department of defense's ( dod ) continuing problems with its complex and inefficient payment processes generally do not permit a transaction to be properly recorded when it occurs , including the matching of a transaction with the related obligation — a critical funds control measure .
this report focuses on the effects of one type of problem disbursement — in - transits — on the navy's funds control and financial reporting .
the navy defines problem in - transits as disbursement transactions that accounting stations have matched to a navy appropriation , reducing the unexpended balance of that appropriation , but have not been able to match to an obligation recorded against that appropriation within 120 days from the date of the transaction .
the department of the navy's inability to accurately account for its disbursements and collections is a serious , long - standing financial management problem .
as stated in our report and testimony on the fiscal year 1997 governmentwide financial statements,the errors and omissions in dod's consolidated statements were a major factor in our inability to form an opinion on the financial statements of the u.s. government .
the issues raised in this report relate directly to weaknesses in the navy's funds control system that result in its inability to ensure that it has not incurred obligations in excess of available budget authority .
