the former chairman , subcommittee on oversight of government management , senate committee on governmental affairs , asked us to examine the coast guard's inventory management system to identify any wasteful or inefficient practices that should be changed .
as agreed with the former chairman's office , we focused our review on the coast guard's inventory management system for its fleet of 240 cutters ( vessels 65 to 399 feet in length ) and developed the following specific questions to guide our review .
second , if not , what initiatives does the coast guard have under way to improve its inventory management ? .
over the last 6 years , we have issued several reports that highlighted the growth in the amount and costs of inventories at the department of defense and its purchase of unneeded items .
first , does the coast guard have the systems needed to effectively manage its inventory of spare and repair parts and supplies ? .
yet delays of as much as 2 years for some early initiatives raise concerns that the coast guard will not meet its targeted completion date .
since the coast guard may take many years to improve its inventory management system , some actions now could help alleviate shortages and excesses and help the coast guard better utilize its inventories .
consequently , the agency cannot minimize the cost of its total inventory as required by federal property management regulations and dot's policy .
to establish and manage its inventories , the coast guard must comply with the criteria contained in federal property management regulations and with the department of transportation's ( dot ) policy .
the coast guard does not have the organizational structure or computer systems necessary to effectively manage its parts and supplies inventory for its cutters .
this action will allow the coast guard to better coordinate interim actions to improve management of its cutter inventories while the fleetwide logistics system is being developed .
federal property management regulations state that each agency shall establish and maintain control of inventories to ensure that total costs will be kept to a minimum consistent with the needs of the agency's programs .
in addition , the coast guard does not expect to complete its integrated system to enhance the use and distribution of its inventory until the year 2002 .
the policy also states that inventories must be managed in an effective manner to ensure that timely and adequate support is rendered and that optimum inventory levels are maintained .
although coast guard officials contend that the agency's lack of information on parts and supplies has not significantly affected the coast guard's mission , it has resulted in inefficient management of resources .
although we agree with the plan's direction , we found that some initiatives are already behind schedule , increasing the potential for delays in the coast guard's long - term efforts to centrally manage its inventories by fiscal year 2002 .
the coast guard's fragmented management structure also limits the agency's ability to determine whether cutters have a shortage or an excess of parts and whether the parts are readily available when needed .
despite these excesses , officials responsible for the individual cutters' inventories told us that they also had shortages of parts .
