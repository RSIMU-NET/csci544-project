my statement will focus on hud's problems and progress to date in addressing ( 1 ) its long - standing management deficiencies ; ( 2 ) its portfolio of multi - and single - family housing insured by the federal housing administration ( fha ) ; ( 3 ) budget and management problems plaguing the public housing program ; ( 4 ) the spiraling cost of assisted housing programs ; and ( 5 ) the need for consensus on hud reforms .
other vexing programmatic and budget problems face hud and the congress .
these problems include how to ( 1 ) reduce excessive housing subsidies and address the physical inadequacies of insured multifamily properties ; ( 2 ) maintain the improved financial health of the single - family insurance fund ; ( 3 ) address the social , management , and budget problems that exist in public housing ; and ( 4 ) deal with the spiraling costs of renewing housing subsidy contracts that assist lower - income families .
despite some progress , problems persist today .
today , despite the promise of reform , reinvention , and transformation initiatives aimed at solving hud's problems , much more remains to be done .
hud is very much an agency in limbo: few of the proposals in hud's reinvention blueprint have been adopted .
when we appeared before this subcommittee just over a year ago , we noted that current housing policies for which hud is responsible drive huge loan commitments and discretionary spending and that controlling that spending would mean reexamining these policies and hud's mission to carry out these policies .
my statement today is based on our ongoing work , our reports and testimonies over the past 4 years , and our observations on recent congressional and departmental initiatives to address hud's problems .
these deficiencies were weak internal controls , an ineffective organizational structure , an insufficient mix of staff with the proper skills , and inadequate information and financial management systems .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss management and budget problems facing the u.s. department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , efforts over the last year to address these problems , and the work that remains .
we believe that , for the foreseeable future , the agency will be high - risk in terms of its programs' being vulnerable to waste , fraud , and abuse .
four long - standing department - wide management deficiencies led to our designation of hud as a high - risk area in january 1994 .
overall , during the last 15 months , limited progress has been made .
as hud continues to downsize , that downsizing will likely affect its ability to limit financial exposure , carry out its mission , and correct department - wide management and information system problems .
the congress and hud have made a start at reexamining housing and community development policy , but reaching consensus on what the policy goals should be , how assistance should be provided , and how much the nation should spend on these activities will take some time .
finally , correcting management deficiencies at hud will take years to complete .
hud's serious management and budget problems have greatly hampered its ability to carry out its wide - ranging responsibilities .
