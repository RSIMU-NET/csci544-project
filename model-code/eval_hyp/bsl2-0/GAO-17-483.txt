since this change , questions have been raised about the impacts of the program's consolidation on funding recipients , and any effects it has had on transit services targeting low - income users .
the fixing america's surface transportation act ( fast act ) included a provision for us to analyze and evaluate possible impacts of changes made to public transportation activities under map - 21 on low - income riders .
however , activities previously funded through the jarc program are still eligible for funding through other programs administered by fta .
in 2012 , the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) made a number of changes to public transportation programs , including repealing and consolidating the jarc program .
this report examines ( 1 ) how fta communicated the 2012 statutory changes to jarc activities to transit providers and ( 2 ) whether and how selected states and transit providers have continued to fund and provide jarc activities since the 2012 statutory changes .
administered by the u.s. department of transportation's ( dot ) federal transit administration ( fta ) , the jarc program provided grants to states and localities to fill gaps in transportation services for low - income individuals needing access to jobs and related services , such as child care and training .
jarc funds could also be used for public transportation activities designed to transport residents in both urbanized and rural areas to suburban employment opportunities regardless of income .
to help provide this access , congress established the job access and reverse commute ( jarc ) program in 1998 .
to determine the current status of jarc program activities that started before the 2012 statutory changes , we reviewed fiscal year 2009 through 2012 funding information on program apportionments , and fta program information about ongoing jarc activities as of february 2017 .
we also interviewed fta officials and representatives of relevant stakeholder groups , such as the community transportation association of america , american association of state highway and transportation officials , and the national rural transit assistance program .
to determine how fta communicated the map - 21 changes to the jarc program we reviewed fta program guidance , including a federal register publication and applicable program circulars .
this population included officials from the 6 selected state transportation agencies , as well as 13 selected large - urban jarc program's designated recipients and 15 subrecipients , which consisted of local transit agencies and nonprofit organizations , among others .
access to transportation is critical for enabling low - income individuals to find and retain employment and attend to other life needs .
however , all seven selected recipients that have expended their dedicated funds and face such uncertainty indicated that they are seeking sustained , long - term funding sources to help them continue jarc activities in the future .
to answer both objectives , we interviewed a total of 34 entities from six states ( arizona , michigan , mississippi , oregon , texas , and virginia ) .
we selected states and jarc recipient agencies to interview to include a range of geographic locations , states that received large amounts of jarc program funds , as well as states that received smaller jarc funding amounts .
