these advances are transformational because they result in new technologies or significantly enhanced capabilities in existing technologies .
in 2007 , the america creating opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology , education , and science act ( competes 2007 ) established the advanced research projects agency - energy ( arpa - e ) in the department of energy ( doe ) to overcome long - term and high - risk technological barriers in the development of energy technologies .
