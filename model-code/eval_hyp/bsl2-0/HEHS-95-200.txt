we include recommendations to the congress that could result in a better match of federal program resources to needy communities , and eliminate funding where there is not a demonstrated need for federal assistance .
our report discusses how the department of health and human services' systems for identifying health care shortage areas are currently used to target resources to the underserved , and department proposals to combine these systems .
this report was prepared at our own initiative in response to the growing number of federal programs using health care shortage areas to determine who can apply for federal assistance .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) spends about $1 billion a year on programs for improving access to health care for areas with shortages of primary care physicians and health care services .
hhs has two such systems: the health professional shortage area ( hpsa ) system identifies underservice caused by a shortage of health professionals , and the medically underserved area ( mua ) system more broadly identifies areas and populations not receiving adequate health services for any reason , including provider shortages .
1.1 ) .
many of these programs depend heavily upon systems to identify and designate specific areas and populations that are underserved .
about 88 percent of all u.s. counties contain hpsas , muas , or both ( see fig .
together , the various programs that use the hpsa and mua systems accounted for more than $1 billion in funding and expenditures in fiscal year 1994 .
hhs has an effort under way to combine and revise the hpsa and mua systems .
while hhs officials told us that no changes would be made before 1996 , a draft working document says that hhs' goal is to replace the existing systems with one that is consistent for all primary care programs , has simpler data - gathering requirements , uses relevant indicators of need , and will not disrupt services in existing areas .
according to hhs officials , this action is being taken to reduce redundancies and differences in the application and administrative processes of the two systems .
table 1.1 summarizes the various programs and their funding levels .
other programs , using various designations of underservice , award scholarships or grants for obligated service or training .
programs under titles vii and viii of the public health service act give funding preference to schools that place graduates in medically underserved communities .
we also asked federal , state , and program participants how much the proposed changes would help them identify underserved populations and provide assistance appropriate to meet their needs .
a primary care hpsa is an area designated by hhs as having a critical shortage of primary health care providers .
the remainder of programs in this category are health professions education and training programs .
in fiscal year 1994 , hhs provided support for about 627 grantees providing services at more than 1,600 sites .
these include areas with no providers or areas with an insufficient number of providers to serve the population living there .
to determine whether proposed changes to the hpsa and mua systems would improve them , we discussed the purpose of the proposed changes with hhs representatives operating the hpsa and mua systems .
