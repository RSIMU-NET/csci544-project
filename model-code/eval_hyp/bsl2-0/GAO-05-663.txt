u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is charged with inspecting these international passengers to prevent terrorists and terrorists weapons from entering the country while fulfilling its mission to foster the nation's economic security through facilitation of lawful international trade and travel .
the amount of time international passengers wait in line to complete airport inspection was an area of concern for the former immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) and u.s. customs service ( customs ) .
shortly after its creation in march 2003 through the combination of the inspections functions from ins , u.s. department of agriculture ( agriculture ) , and customs , cbp began developing a new staff allocation model to help ensure that inspections facilities , such as those at airports , are adequately staffed to inspect international passengers .
about 75 percent of these passengers , or about 59 million , were inspected at 20 of these airports .
if the inspections process impedes the flow of individuals through the airport , then commerce and tourism could be adversely affected .
since september 11 , 2001 , the federal government has emphasized the need to thoroughly inspect all international passengers so that terrorists do not enter the country .
2 ) what steps have airports and airlines taken to minimize passenger wait times ? .
that year , approximately 78 million passengers wishing to enter the united states were inspected at 285 international airports .
3 ) how has cbp managed staffing to minimize wait times across airports ? .
every person entering the united states must be inspected to ensure he or she is entering the country lawfully , and in fiscal year 2004 , the federal government spent over $1 billion inspecting air travelers .
one way cbp fosters travel is by processing international passengers through airport inspections in a timely manner .
to assess cbp's efforts to minimize wait times for international air passengers while ensuring security , we answered the following questions: 1 ) what are the wait times at the 20 u.s. international airports that receive most of the international traffic and what factors affect wait times ? .
by not addressing these weaknesses , cbp is bypassing an opportunity to develop information that would further enhance management decision - making concerning staff allocation and staff needs and providing budget justifications .
cbp has two priority missions: ( 1 ) detecting and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the united states , and ( 2 ) facilitating the orderly and efficient flow of legitimate trade and travel .
cbp's supporting missions include interdicting illegal drugs and other contraband ; apprehending individuals who are attempting to enter the united states illegally ; inspecting inbound and outbound people , vehicles , and cargo ; enforcing all laws of the united states at the border ; protecting u.s. agricultural and economic interests from harmful pests and diseases ; regulating and facilitating international trade ; collecting import duties ; and enforcing u.s. trade laws .
finally , cbp has not fully addressed what factors will be included in its model currently under development or set milestones for completing and implementing the model .
we also reviewed documentation on cbp's activities for allocating staff to ports and spoke with agency officials responsible for planning and implementing a staffing model to be used to help manage staff .
