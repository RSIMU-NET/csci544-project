toward this end , cms developed and implemented an information technology system to help providers determine medicare beneficiaries' eligibility for health care services and supplies in response to requirements under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 , or hipaa .
our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) identify the operational status of hets , ( 2 ) identify any steps cms has taken to ensure users' satisfaction and plans to take to ensure the performance of the system supports future requirements , and ( 3 ) describe cms's policies , processes , and procedures for protecting the privacy of beneficiary eligibility data provided by the system .
five years after its implementation , however , problems with the performance of the system were noted by cms and its users .
cms officials stated that , in accordance with the act , on may 31 , 2005 , the agency began offering automated services for determining medicare eligibility for certain beneficiaries through the use of an information technology system called the hipaa eligibility transaction system , or hets .
to avoid risks that they may not be reimbursed for services , these health care providers take steps to determine whether patients and services are covered by entities that pay for health care expenses , such as medicare .
in 2011 , medicare covered about 48.4 million of these individuals with a total expenditure of approximately $565 billion .
the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers medicare , is responsible for ensuring that proper payments are made on behalf of its beneficiaries to the doctors , hospitals , visiting nurses , and others who provide health care services and treatment , along with entities that supply medical equipment such as wheelchairs , walkers , and hospital beds to their patients .
it is funded by general revenues ; payroll taxes paid by most employees ; employers and individuals who are self employed ; and beneficiary premiums .
because of the important role that hets plays in assuring that providers have timely and accurate data to determine medicare beneficiaries' eligibility , you requested that we undertake a review of the system .
we also collected and analyzed program planning documentation that described long - term plans for the system and assessed those plans against projections of future requirements and recommendations from independent studies of cms's implementation of the system .
medicare is a federal program that pays for health care services for individuals 65 years and older , certain individuals with disabilities , and those with end - stage renal disease .
finally , to describe the policies , processes , and procedures established by cms to protect the privacy of beneficiary eligibility data , we evaluated agency documentation such as agreements with users regarding the use of the system and requirements for handling data , and the system's privacy impact and risk assessments .
to identify the operational status of hets , we collected and analyzed documentation from program officials that described daily operations of the system , such as reports on incoming transaction volume , response time , and downtime , along with documents that describe outcomes of the system , including reported problems .
