to reduce data center duplication and costs , the office of management and budget's ( omb ) federal chief information officer ( cio ) launched two initiatives .
accordingly , our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) determine agencies' progress on data center closures and the related savings that have been achieved , and describe agencies' plans for future closures and savings ; ( 2 ) assess agencies' progress against omb's data center optimization targets ; and ( 3 ) identify effective agency practices for achieving data center closures , cost savings , and optimization .
omb to develop goals for the amount of planned cost savings and optimization improvements that agencies are to achieve through fdcci .
among the requirements related to federal data center consolidation , the law required: covered departments and agencies ( agencies ) to annually report to omb about federal data center inventories and strategies to achieve consolidation , including yearly calculations of investment and cost savings .
further , congress recognized the importance of reforming the government - wide management of it and , in december 2014 , enacted federal information technology acquisition reform provisions ( commonly referred to as fitara ) as a part of the carl levin and howard p. ‘buck' mckeon national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 .
it shifted the focus to optimizing agencies' remaining data centers by requiring , among other things , that agencies consolidate inefficient infrastructure , optimize existing facilities , and transition to more efficient infrastructure , such as cloud services .
the federal government's demand for information technology ( it ) is ever increasing .
in recent years , as federal agencies have modernized their operations , put more of their services online , and improved their information security profiles , their need for computing power and data storage resources has grown .
we compared information on these agencies' completed and planned data center closures to omb's fiscal year 2018 consolidation goals , as documented in its august 2016 memorandum ( m - 16-19 ) .
accordingly , this growing demand has led to a dramatic rise in the number of federal data centers and a corresponding increase in operational costs .
the first , launched in 2010 , was the federal data center consolidation initiative ( fdcci ) , which aimed to reduce the number of data centers that were outdated or duplicative .
omb is to make the goals publicly available and compare progress against the goals .
although many agencies have struggled to meet their individual dcoi targets , other agencies have successfully met omb's goals for data center closures , savings , and optimization .
in addition to these requirements , fitara included a provision for gao to annually review and verify the quality and completeness of federal data center inventories and strategies for consolidation submitted by the agencies covered by the law .
the second initiative — the data center optimization initiative ( dcoi ) — was launched in august 2016 and superseded fdcci .
we identified future closures by counting data centers that agencies reported as planned closures , as of august 2018 through fiscal year 2023 .
among other things , the guidance required agencies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure , optimize existing facilities , improve their security posture , and achieve cost savings .
