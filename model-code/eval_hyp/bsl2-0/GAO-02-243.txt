the health plans are administered by the united mine workers of america health and retirement funds ( umwaf ) .
although the congress has made special appropriations to keep the cbf solvent , these actions have not addressed the cbf's long - term financial challenges .
to ensure that these individuals would continue to receive the health benefits specified in previous collective bargaining agreements reached with coal companies , often gained in exchange for lower pensions , the congress enacted the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 ( coal act ) .
since 1997 , the cbf has incurred annual operating deficits .
from 1997 through 2002 , these premiums rose by 47 percent to keep pace with increases in per capita health care spending .
health care spending has risen faster than contributions to the cbf , and financial difficulties have been compounded by court decisions that have reduced the per beneficiary premium paid by the coal miners' former employers and relieved some companies of the responsibility for paying premiums for certain beneficiaries .
to help the congress consider long - term solutions to the funds' financial challenges , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) how the funds' health benefits compare to benefits offered by other retiree plans , ( 2 ) how the health care costs of the funds' beneficiaries compare to the costs of other retiree groups , and ( 3 ) the efforts of the funds' officials to control costs .
the coal act replaced the existing umwa retiree health benefit funds with the combined benefit fund ( cbf ) and the 1992 benefit plan — collectively referred to in this report as the funds .
the 1992 benefit plan has a different financing structure and premiums paid by coal companies are adjusted each year to meet the expected health care costs of covered beneficiaries .
in contrast to the cbf , the 1992 benefit plan has not incurred ongoing deficits .
consequently , actuarial projections indicate that annual revenue shortfalls are expected to continue .
the act specified how each fund would be financed by the coal miners' former employers and other sources to cover the health care costs not paid for by medicare .
because 89 percent of the funds' beneficiaries are eligible for medicare , we compared the health care costs for these individuals to the health care costs of other , demographically similar medicare beneficiaries covered by employer - sponsored insurance .
in 2001 , there were about 55,000 beneficiaries in the cbf and about 6,000 in the 1992 benefit plan .
some former employers had stopped mining coal or gone out of business , so they were no longer contributing to the united mine workers of america ( umwa ) retiree benefit funds .
in 1992 , certain retired coal miners and their spouses and dependents — more than 100,000 individuals in all — faced a potential decrease in their employment - related health insurance coverage or loss of such coverage altogether .
most of the funds' beneficiaries are eligible for medicare ( 89 percent ) and others are from 55 to 64 years of age and nearing eligibility ( 7 percent ) .
we also interviewed the funds' managers and their contractors , officials from the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) , and coal company representatives about the financing and operations of the funds .
