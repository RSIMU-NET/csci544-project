other nations and the european union ( eu ) are reportedly also considering removing sanctions or restrictions on burma depending on their assessments of the by - elections .
burma's parliamentary system consists of the bicameral union parliament ( pyidaungsu hluttaw ) plus separate local parliaments for each of the nation's seven states and seven regions .
the two chambers of the union parliament are the lower house people's assembly ( pyithu hluttaw ) with 440 seats , and the upper house national assembly ( amyotha hluttaw ) with 224 seats .
depending on the conduct of the election , the official election results , and the treatment of the newly elected members of parliament , u.s. policy toward burma may undergo a major shift , possibly including the waiver or removal of some of the current u.s. sanctions .
the april by - elections were to fill 40 vacant seats in people's assembly , 6 seats in the national assembly , 1 seat in ayeyarwady ( irrawaddy ) region , and 1 seat in the bago ( pegu ) region ( see figure 1 ) .
the exclusion of certain political parties and the campaign irregularities also raised doubts about how free and fair the by - elections were .
the republic of the union of myanmar ( burma ) held parliamentary by - elections on april 1 , 2012 .
this is more than enough votes to pass laws or amend the constitution without the support of any opposition party members .
all 48 seats were previously held by members of the pro - military union solidarity and development party ( usdp ) .
however , on march 23 , 2012 , the union election commission ( uec ) postponed voting for three people's assembly seats in the kachin state for security reasons .
the by - elections originally were to fill 48 vacant seats in burma's various parliaments .
however , a number of incidents during the campaign period revealed efforts by government officials to undermine the ability of the nld to carry out its campaign , as well as intimidate or coerce people to support the usdp .
less than 9% of the total seats in the people's assembly and under 3% in the national assembly were contested ( see table 1 ) .
in terms of the overall balance of power in the union parliament , the by - elections will have only a marginal impact .
the by - elections are largely considered significant because of the participation of the nld , and its chair aung san suu kyi , who is viewed both domestically and internationally as the leader of burma's democracy movement .
the election campaign unofficially began in march 2012 , after each party registered its slate of candidates with the union election commission ( uec ) .
on march 20 , 2012 , it was reported that the burmese government had notified the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) that it could send election observers to burma as of march 28 , 2012 .
president thein sein and the union government pledged to make the by - elections free and fair .
in contrast to election day in november 2010 , voting on april 1 went comparatively smoothly .
