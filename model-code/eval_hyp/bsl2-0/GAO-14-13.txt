dot's efforts related to these technologies are being led by nhtsa and the intelligent transportation systems ( its ) joint program office within dot's research and innovative technology administration ( rita ) .
we examined: ( 1 ) the state of development of v2v technologies and their anticipated benefits ; ( 2 ) the challenges , if any , that will affect the deployment of these technologies , and what actions , if any , dot is taking to address them ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the potential costs associated with these technologies for automobile manufacturers and consumers .
to address these issues , we reviewed documentation relevant to the v2v technology research efforts of dot and the automobile industry , such as dot's its strategic research plan , 2010 - 2014 progress update 2012 and documentation related to dot's efforts to estimate the potential benefits of v2v technologies .
for example , according to the department of transportation's ( dot ) national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) , 5.3 million police - reported vehicle crashes occurred in the united states in 2011 , resulting in about 32,000 fatalities and more than 2.2 million injuries .
in late 2013 , nhtsa is planning to announce further actions it will take regarding these technologies for passenger vehicles , including potentially announcing intent to pursue future regulatory action , such as a proposed rulemaking to mandate the installation of v2v technologies in newly manufactured passenger vehicles .
the inclusion of v2v technologies in newly manufactured vehicles could increase vehicle costs .
dot and the automobile industry have been conducting research on new types of technologies to prevent crashes — called vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) technologies — in recent years .
nhtsa aims to reduce injuries , deaths , and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes through a number of actions , such as establishing safety standards for motor vehicles and conducting research that supports vehicle safety .
recently , however , the automobile industry has begun to introduce technologies that are intended to prevent accidents .
you asked us to examine the development and possible future deployment of v2v technologies .
based on the data shared , v2v technologies are capable of warning drivers of imminent collisions , including some that sensor - based crash avoidance technologies would be unable to detect .
we interviewed nhtsa and rita officials about these efforts .
nhtsa's safety standards cover various aspects of vehicle safety , such as brakes , headlights , seat belts , air bags , and child restraints .
these technologies facilitate the sharing of data , such as vehicle speed and location , among vehicles to warn drivers of potential collisions .
according to nhtsa , if v2v technologies are widely deployed , they have the potential to address 76 percent of multi - vehicle crashes involving at least one light vehicle by providing warnings to drivers .
every year , motor vehicle crashes in the united states result in numerous injuries and deaths and high economic costs .
crash avoidance technologies , which use sensors such as cameras and radar , can observe a vehicle's visible surroundings and issue warnings to the driver when certain types of collisions with other vehicles or obstacles appear to be imminent .
