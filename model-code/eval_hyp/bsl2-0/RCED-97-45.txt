 ( 2 ) what effect would lower loan rates have on the relationship between u.s. and world prices ? .
for example , the peanut program has domestic marketing restrictions and the sugar program has a tariff - rate import quota .
 ( 3 ) how would a lower loan rate affect step 2 payments for cotton exports and what impact have recent changes in the timing of payments had on the program's effectiveness ? .
similarly , the peanut and sugar programs have price - support features .
concerned about how these remaining support provisions affect u.s. commodity prices in comparison with world prices , you asked the following questions: ( 1 ) do marketing loan provisions prevent loan rates from acting as price floors and do they allow u.s. prices to fall to levels that are closer to world prices ? .
 ( 4 ) what steps could be taken to make the peanut and sugar programs more market - oriented ? .
the 1990 and 1996 farm acts continued to build on these efforts and introduced additional changes .
however , the congress retained a number of income - and price - support provisions as a safety net for producers .
in addition , for cotton , peanuts , and sugar , other mechanisms are in place to help support producers and related industries .
the momentum for change in u.s. agricultural policy began with the passage of the 1985 farm act , when efforts were made to make federal farm programs more market - oriented and to reduce the amount of support that the government guarantees producers for their commodities .
the marketing loan provisions , which allow producers to repay their loans at alternative repayment rates that are lower than the loan rates , were added to nonrecourse loans , in part to prevent the loan rates from serving as price floors while protecting producers' income from the effects of low market prices .
under the cotton program , domestic mills and cotton exporters receive a payment — known as the step 2 payment — to help defray the higher cost of u.s. cotton and make it more competitive in world markets .
in particular , nonrecourse loans with marketing loan provisions continue to be available for a number of commodities , including upland cotton ( hereafter referred to as cotton ) ,rice , wheat , feedgrains , and oilseeds .
through nonrecourse loans , producers pledge their commodities as collateral and upon forfeiture receive guaranteed minimum returns based on prices known as loan rates .
the congress made a number of changes to both programs through the 1996 farm act to reduce u.s. prices and some of the economic inefficiencies in order to make the programs more market - oriented .
these changes would help lower u.s. prices and increase economic efficiency , but one tradeoff would be a potential reduction in producers' revenue .
as we recommended in the past , greater market orientation could be achieved through ( 1 ) further reductions in the support price for peanuts and ( 2 ) a reduction in the loan rate for sugar and an increase in the tariff - rate import quota .
as a result , these programs have cost users of peanuts and sugar and the government hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
