recognizing the severity of issues related to government - wide management of it , in december 2014 , the carl levin and howard p. “buck” mckeon national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 enacted provisions commonly referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act ( fitara ) .
this high - risk area highlights several critical it initiatives in need of additional progress , including the it dashboard , and also identified actions needed to make progress .
although there have been numerous initiatives undertaken to better manage the more than $80 billion that is annually invested in information technology ( it ) , federal it investments have too frequently failed or incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission - related outcomes .
specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe agencies' processes for determining the cio risk ratings for major it investments and ( 2 ) assess the risk of federal it investments and analyze any differences with the investments' cio risk ratings .
among other things , fitara states that the office of management and budget ( omb ) shall make available to the public a list of each major it investment including data on cost , schedule , and performance .
as such , we have recently placed improving the management of it acquisitions and operations on our high risk list .
to select the agencies and investments , we reviewed data reported to omb as part of the federal budget process to identify major investments which planned to spend at least 80 percent of their fiscal year 2015 funding on development , modernization , and enhancement activities .
launched in june 2009 , the dashboard is intended to provide transparency for these investments in order to facilitate public monitoring of government operations and accountability for investment performance by the federal chief information officers ( cio ) who oversee them .
accordingly , it is vital that omb provide timely and accurate data on the federal it dashboard — its public website that reports performance and supporting data for major it investments .
among other things , agencies are to submit ratings from their cios , which , according to omb's instructions , should reflect the level of risk facing an investment relative to that investment's ability to accomplish its goals .
the law was designed to improve agencies' acquisition of it and enable congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings .
recognizing the importance of government - wide management of it , in december 2014 , congress enacted it acquisition reform legislation , fitara .
this resulted in 95 investments at 15 agencies .
in december 2014 , fitara codified the requirement for cios to categorize their major it investment risks in accordance with omb guidance .
this produced a list of 17 agencies and 107 selected investments .
fitara contains specific requirements related to seven areas , including one titled “enhanced transparency and improved risk management in information technology investments.” among other things , that area requires omb and agencies to make publicly available detailed information on federal it investments , and agency cios to categorize their it investments by risk .
