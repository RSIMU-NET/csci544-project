this report describes the extent to which dot has ( 1 ) designed internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that federal employees do not use the transerve debit card to make non - transit - related purchases and ( 2 ) worked with irs to ensure its debit - card program met requirements for excludable qualified transportation fringe benefits in relevant statutes , treasury regulations , and irs administrative rules .
since transerve implemented its debit - card program , members of congress have raised questions about whether the debit cards could be used for consumer purchases or whether dot has sufficiently restricted the debit cards to prevent non - transit - related purchases .
in fiscal year 2014,106 federal entities entered into interagency agreements on a fee - for - service basis with the department of transportation's ( dot ) office of transportation services ( transerve ) to distribute about $210 million in transit benefits to their employees .
these members of congress also were interested in whether dot worked with the internal revenue service ( irs ) to ensure the transerve debit - card program was in compliance with relevant statutes , treasury regulations , and irs's administrative rules to provide for the exclusion from gross income of qualifying transportation fringe benefits .
the internal revenue code ( code ) allows eligible employees to exclude qualified transportation fringe benefits from gross income .
to identify transerve's internal - control processes and practices for identifying and denying non - transit - related purchases , we reviewed transerve program guidance and methods for reviewing debit card transactions ; reporting on potential misuse of the card ; and communicating with federal entity clients .
table 1 describes these five internal - control standards for designing and implementing internal control .
we also reviewed dot's agency financial reports for fiscal years 2011 through 2014 and an external management review of the transerve program's internal controls .
we also interviewed transerve officials about the control activities for the transit debit - card technology , their processes for monitoring federal employees' transit debit card purchases â€” including identifying ineligible purchases , and communicating such information with client agencies .
you asked us to review dot's administration of the transerve debit - card program and determine if dot worked with irs to ensure compliance with its rules and regulations governing the exclusion of qualifying transportation fringe benefits from gross income .
to identify any gaps between internal control standards and the design of transerve's internal control processes , we performed a comparative analysis of the federal internal control standards and transerve's processes and practices and determined whether there are any gaps .
we focused on aspects of the standards that were most relevant to identifying and denying non - transit - related purchases in the design of transerve's internal controls .
to evaluate the extent to which dot has designed internal controls for transerve debit cards , we used criteria from gao's standards for internal controls in the federal government .
in 2011 , transerve began introducing the transerve debit card with selected federal entities , allowing eligible federal employees to purchase transit passes , and completed implementation in selected locations in 2014 .
the federal government's transit benefit program was established in 1993 and was intended to expand federal employees' use of public transportation by providing transit vouchers and passes for public transit as a qualified transportation fringe benefit .
