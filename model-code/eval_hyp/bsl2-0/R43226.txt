however , this power is still subject to constitutional limitations , including substantive and procedural due process protections .
in deciding what degree of judicial review is appropriate in immigration matters , congress has sought to balance judicial review between fairness to desired immigrants ( workers , family , refugees / asylees ) and facilitation of the removal of detrimental aliens ( national security risks / terrorists , criminals , public charges ) .
concerns about the growing population of undocumented aliens , fraudulent asylum claims , terrorism threats , and crimes of drug , human , and arms trafficking , led to legislation in 1996 and 2005 that limited judicial review , including the availability of habeas corpus proceedings .
however , in the wake of u.s. supreme court decisions construing the administrative procedure act ( apa ) as applying to and providing an avenue for judicial review of immigration adjudications , congress amended the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) of 1952 by adding a judicial review provision in 1961 that provided for review of deportation orders by federal courts of appeals , but only for habeas corpus review of exclusion orders by federal district courts .
2278 would generally continue the trend of limiting judicial review ; s. 744 would more narrowly limit judicial review in certain instances of employer noncompliance with foreign worker visa programs .
in immigration cases , the degree of judicial review of administrative decisions and actions that may be constitutionally required depends on the relative interests involved .
on the other hand , s. 744 also provides for judicial review for legalization programs .
initially , a habeas corpus proceeding provided the primary avenue of judicial review of various immigration determinations .
the power of congress and the executive branch to legislate and implement the conditions for admitting aliens into the united states and permitting them to remain is so broad as to be virtually immune from judicial control .
in the 113 th congress , h.r .
the judicial review provisions and related litigation for the legalization program under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 ( irca ) remain relevant in light of the legalization provisions of s. 744 , the senate - passed bill known as the border security , economic opportunity , and immigration modernization act .
furthermore , federal courts have differed about whether the doctrine of nonreviewability extends to nonconsular officials , including officers of the former immigration and naturalization service and the u.s. department of homeland security ( dhs ) .
accordingly , consular officers within the u.s. department of state ( dos ) generally have nonreviewable authority to deny visas .
therefore , the dos regulations only provide for administrative , supervisory review of visa denials .
in contrast , s. 744 , as passed by the senate , provides for judicial review of the various legalization avenues that the bill would establish ; it does not include new restrictions on judicial review regarding removal / detention or visa denial or revocation , although it does include limits on judicial review in other contexts , such as penalties for employer noncompliance with various requirements for employing foreign workers .
during the senate judiciary mark - up of the bill , some amendments to limit judicial review of legalization denials were rejected , as well as one to limit judicial review of dhs visa denial or revocation for security purposes .
