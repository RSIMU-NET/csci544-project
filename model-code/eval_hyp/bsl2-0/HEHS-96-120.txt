specifically , we examined ( 1 ) expanded state use of the waiver program , ( 2 ) the growth in long - term care costs for individuals with developmental disabilities , ( 3 ) how costs are controlled , and ( 4 ) strengths and limitations in states' approaches to assuring quality in community settings .
the population with developmental disabilities receives more than $13 billion annually in public funding for long - term care , second only to the elderly .
more than 300,000 adults with developmental disabilities receive government long - term services financed primarily through medicaid and to a lesser extent through state and local programs .
recently , states have begun to significantly expand the use of the medicaid 1915 ( c ) home and community - based waiver , enacted by the congress in 1981 , to provide alternatives to institutional care for persons with developmental disabilities .
persons with developmental disabilities have traditionally received their long - term care in institutional settings .
adults with developmental disabilities are highly dependent on public programs for meeting their long - term care needs .
to conduct our work , we reviewed the literature , interviewed health care financing administration ( hcfa ) officials responsible for waiver programs and national experts , and analyzed national data on medicaid expenditures and recipients .
the waiver program has two advantages .
most persons with developmental disabilities have mental retardation , but others have severe , chronic disability resulting from cerebral palsy , epilepsy , or other life - long conditions , except mental illness , that began before they were 22 years old .
to understand changes in services , cost , and quality assurance , we reviewed national data and conducted three case studies on issues and choices states faced in using the waiver program .
long - term care services can include supervision and assistance with everyday activities such as help in dressing , going to the bathroom , managing money , and keeping out of danger .
in contrast , states must serve all eligible individuals in the regular medicaid program .
second , it permits states to meet the needs of many persons with developmental disabilities by offering them a broader range of services in less restrictive settings such as group or family home , rather than in a medicaid intermediate care facility for mental retardation ( icf / mr ) , the setting where most of the institutional care for this population is provided .
at your request , we examined states' experiences in utilizing the flexibility offered by the medicaid waiver program to provide care for adults with developmental disabilities in alternative settings .
first , it gives states a tool to control costs by allowing them to limit the number of recipients served .
we also reviewed data on costs and program participation for these states .
we chose these states because they have large waiver programs , provide a range in state size and geographic representation , and have different strategies for using the waiver program .
in visits to these states , we interviewed program officials , providers , recipients , families , and advocates .
medicaid funds most publicly supported long - term care services for persons with developmental disabilities .
