congress is currently considering several legislative proposals that address the protection of critical infrastructure , including mandating security measures at chemical facilities .
debate has focused on whether the federal government should impose security requirements on chemical facilities or whether voluntary industry actions are sufficient .
in this report , we ( 1 ) summarize available information on the threats and risks from terrorism that u.s. chemical facilities face ; ( 2 ) describe federal requirements for security preparedness and the safe management of chemicals at these facilities ; ( 3 ) describe actions federal agencies have taken to assess the vulnerability of the chemical industry or to address security preparedness ; and ( 4 ) describe the voluntary actions the chemical industry has taken to address security preparedness , and the challenges it faces in protecting its assets and operations .
the federal government's role in protecting facilities from terrorist attack has been much debated since september 11 , 2001 .
the events of september 11 , 2001 , brought heightened attention to chemical facility security and the possibility of an intentional terrorist - caused chemical release .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , under the clean air act , requires that about 15,000 facilities with more than threshold amounts of chemicals posing the greatest risk to human health and the environment take a number of steps to prevent and prepare for an accidental chemical release .
these facilities must develop a risk management program , which includes an assessment of the off - site consequences of an accidental chemical release and an accident prevention program , and an emergency response plan .
other industries , such as agricultural retailers , drinking water and wastewater treatment systems , food processors and distributors who have ammonia refrigeration systems , and petroleum refineries , also house these chemicals .
as agreed with your offices , we examined a number of issues surrounding the security of the chemical industry .
however , attention was focused largely on the risks of accidental , rather than intentional , chemical releases .
following these events , the president , in the national strategy for homeland security , identified 13 sectors as critical to the nation's infrastructure .
even before september 11 , 2001 , protecting chemical facilities was the shared responsibility of federal , state , and local governments in partnership with the private sector .
as the events of september 11 , 2001 , showed , terrorists can cause enormous damage to our country by attacking infrastructure essential to our economy and jeopardizing public health and safety .
in all , the federal government estimates that a total of 15,000 facilities in the united states produce , use , or store more than threshold amounts of these 140 hazardous chemicals .
to determine the threats and risks from terrorism faced by u.s. chemical facilities , we interviewed officials at the department of defense's army office of the surgeon general and the defense threat reduction agency .
to determine the federal requirements for security preparedness and the safe management of chemicals at these facilities , we interviewed officials from the department of labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) and epa on safety standards and legal authority .
we interviewed officials at epa headquarters , including those from the chemical emergency preparedness and prevention office , and we reviewed risk management plan ( rmp ) data .
