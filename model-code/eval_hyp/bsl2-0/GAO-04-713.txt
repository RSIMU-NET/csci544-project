congress is considering legislation that would require coverage of colorectal cancer screening tests among all private health insurance plans .
some previous surveys of the extent of colorectal cancer screening coverage among private health insurance plans have been limited to only certain health plans or market segments .
moreover , laws that may require coverage of the screening tests among health plans sold by insurers vary from state to state .
specifically , we determined 1. 	 the extent to which state laws require private health insurance plans to cover the four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes ; and 2. 	 the extent to which private health insurance plans cover the four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes , specifically health plans sold by insurers to small employers and individuals in states that do not offered by large employers across the united states , and offered through the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) .
private health insurance plans are offered through different market segments — such as the small employer , individual , or large employer segments , or the health plans offered to federal employees .
that is , insurers and large employers with more colorectal cancer screening benefits could have been more likely to participate in our survey than those with fewer colorectal cancer screening test benefits .
from these insurers we obtained information from plan representatives about their coverage policies for their health plan with the most members .
four key tests — fecal occult blood test ( fobt ) , flexible sigmoidoscopy , double - contrast barium enema ( dcbe ) , and colonoscopy — are commonly used to detect colorectal cancer or its symptoms .
private health insurance plans generally cover these four tests to diagnose suspected cases of cancer when symptoms are present ; however , the extent to which plans cover the tests for screening purposes is less clear .
to examine the extent to which health insurance plans sold to small employers and individuals by insurers in the states without laws requiring coverage of the tests actually covered the tests , we contacted the largest health insurers in 10 states without such laws .
to identify states that had laws that require private health insurance plans to cover colorectal cancer screening tests , we reviewed the laws in each state and the district of columbia as of may 2004 , and consulted with state officials to clarify the laws as necessary .
further , although we achieved relatively high response rates , we may nonetheless have encountered selection bias .
at your request we have examined the extent to which private health insurance plans cover colorectal cancer screening tests .
the mortality associated with colorectal cancer can be reduced through early diagnosis and treatment .
we received responses to our questions from 95 percent ( 18 of 19 ) of the small employer insurers we contacted and 82 percent ( 14 of 17 ) of the individual insurers we contacted .
over 146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed and almost 57,000 people will die from the disease in 2004 , according to the american cancer society ( acs ) .
in addition , we surveyed a small number of health plans , precluding our ability to generalize the findings beyond these plans .
