even before the war in afghanistan , the department of defense ( dod ) had begun looking for solutions to long - standing problems facing the close air support mission .
thus , our objectives were to assess efforts by dod and the military services to ( 1 ) provide adequate training for joint close air support missions and ( 2 ) enhance the capabilities of the equipment used to support this mission .
failure to respond to a call for air support can leave troops exposed to enemy fire ; however , mistakes in communications and targeting can result in fatalities among friendly forces .
timely , well - practiced procedures and communication are essential because close air support on the battlefield often has to happen fast to achieve its objective .
while most recent close air support operations have been successful , “friendly fire” incidents tragically illustrated the dangers of the mission .
the working groups have addressed a myriad of issues , but their primary focus has been on improving training and equipment interoperability across the services in both the active and reserve components .
in afghanistan , close air support became particularly critical because light forces were introduced into battle without artillery , leaving air power as their sole means of fire support .
you asked that we recommend any actions that dod and the services could take to improve close air support effectiveness while simultaneously reducing risk to friendly forces .
though we completed our work before hostilities began in iraq , this operation also showed the increased importance of integrating air power into the ground fight .
because joint close air support is — by its nature — a joint mission that transcends any single military service , dod has formed steering groups and other interservice task forces to examine the mission area .
such close air support requires painstaking coordination between air and ground elements .
because of concerns about such unfortunate “friendly fire” occurrences , you requested that we review close air support training and doctrine to ensure that the u.s. military is prepared for future conflicts .
this axiom is especially true when aircraft are needed to deliver bombs on targets close to troops on the ground .
the success or failure of our military forces in combat is directly linked to the realism and thoroughness of their training beforehand .
a detailed description of our scope and methodology is included in appendix i .
however , dod has acknowledged that joint close air support mission deficiencies have existed for many years .
while dod has acknowledged the need for more effective training in its 2001 joint close air support action plan , it has been unable to resolve most of the plan's action items because of the time and effort required to resolve the issues and disagreement among the services .
dod's efforts to improve close air support training have met with limited success .
recent operations in afghanistan have demonstrated that the military is placing an increased emphasis on joint close air support , but some serious challenges remain .
dod has had limited success in overcoming the barriers that prevent troops from receiving the realistic , standardized training that is needed to prepare them for joint operations .
