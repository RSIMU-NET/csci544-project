for example , adjustments to the estimates ( from such factors as changes in estimation methods and estimated number of respondents ) accounted for a decrease of about 156 million hours ( 1.9 percent ) , and agency burden reduction efforts led to a decrease of about 97 million hours ( 1.2 percent ) .
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other categories , primarily an increase of 119 million hours ( 1.5 percent ) arising from new statutes .
the estimated total burden was 7.971 billion hours — a decrease of 1.6 percent ( 128 million burden hours ) from the previous year's total of about 8.099 billion hours .
these agencies , whose missions involve numerous information collections , have devoted significant resources to targeted burden reduction efforts that involve extensive outreach to stakeholders .
in contrast , the internal revenue service ( irs ) and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) have set up processes outside the cio review process that are specifically focused on reducing burden .
the total paperwork burden imposed by federal information collections shrank slightly in fiscal year 2004 , according to estimates provided in omb's annual pra report to congress .
numerous factors have contributed to these problems , including a lack of management support and weaknesses in omb guidance .
a major aim of the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) is to minimize the burden that these collections impose on the public , while maximizing their public benefit .
different types of changes contributed to the overall change in these estimates , according to omb .
under the act , the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to approve all such collections and to report annually on the agencies' estimates of the associated burden .
however , because of limitations in the accuracy of burden estimates , the significance of small changes in these estimates is unclear .
for its testimony , gao was asked to comment on omb's burden report for 2004 and to discuss its recent study of pra implementation ( gao - 05-424 ) , concentrating on cio review and certification processes and describing alternative processes that two agencies have used to minimize burden .
to achieve these goals , the pra includes a range of provisions that establish standards and procedures for effective implementation and oversight .
according to the two agencies , these efforts led to significant reductions in burden on the public .
nonetheless , as the best indicators of paperwork burden available , these estimates can be useful as long as the limitations are clearly understood .
because these reviews were not rigorous , omb , the agency , and the public had reduced assurance that the standards in the act — such as minimizing burden — were consistently met .
further , although the law requires cios to provide support for certifications , agency files contained little evidence that cio reviewers had made efforts to improve the support offered by program offices .
in addition , agency chief information officers ( cio ) are to review information collections before they are submitted to omb for approval and certify that the collections meet certain standards set forth in the act .
among the pra provisions aimed at helping to achieve the goals of minimizing burden while maximizing utility is the requirement for cio review and certification of information collections .
