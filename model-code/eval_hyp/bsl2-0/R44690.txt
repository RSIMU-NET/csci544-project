111-148 , as amended ) establishes a transitional reinsurance program that is designed to provide payment to non - grandfathered , non - group market health plans ( also known as individual market health plans ) that enrolled high - risk enrollees for 2014 through 2016 .
the transitional reinsurance program's aim is to protect against the potential incentive to increase premiums by offsetting the expenditures associated with high - risk individuals .
under the program , the secretary of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) collected reinsurance contributions from health insurers and from third - party administrators on behalf of group health plans .
section 1341 of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
the third section discusses questions , including those raised by a 2016 government accountability office ( gao ) report , regarding the scope of hhs's authority to administer the transitional reinsurance program .
the secretary then used those contributions to make reinsurance payments to health insurers who enrolled high - cost enrollees ( statutes required the hhs secretary to determine how high - risk enrollees are identified , and the secretary in turn defined high - risk enrollees as high - cost enrollees ) in their non - group market plans both inside and outside of the exchanges ( also known as marketplaces , where individuals can shop for and purchase private health insurance coverage ) .
the second section describes the components of the transitional reinsurance program , as well as implementation of the program .
the first section of the report provides background information on reinsurance and the aca risk mitigation programs .
this report provides an overview of the aca's transitional reinsurance program .
finally , the report includes a table in the appendix that summarizes key aspects of the transitional reinsurance program .
the hhs secretary is implementing the transitional reinsurance program for all states , citing the authority under section 1321 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the aca .
arguably , cms's prioritization of reinsurance contributions for reinsurance payments over u.s. treasury contributions provides greater assistance to insurers by ensuring that more funding is available to make reinsurance payments to those insurers that enroll high - cost individuals .
in those states where the federal government is implementing the transitional reinsurance program , hhs ( through cms ) acts as the reinsurance entity for purposes of section 1341 of the aca , collecting contributions from covered insurers and third - party administrators ( i.e. , contributing entities ) , as well as making payments from those contributions to eligible insurers under the program .
although states are directed to establish their own transitional reinsurance programs , currently no state is doing so .
in its opinion , gao focused on the language of section 1341 , noting that when congress has enacted statutory language that speaks directly to an issue , such statutory language , viewed in the context of the overall statutory scheme , must control .
cms currently allocates all collections in a given year to reinsurance payments for insurers until the statutory collection targets for those purposes have been met .
once the statutory collection targets for a year are satisfied , any further collections in that year would be allocated to program administration expenses and to the u.s. treasury .
