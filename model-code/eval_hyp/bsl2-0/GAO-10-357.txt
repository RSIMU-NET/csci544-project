additionally , state and usaid have relied on grantees to support critical efforts such as infrastructure and economic development in iraq and afghanistan .
the department of defense ( dod ) , the department of state ( state ) , and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) have relied extensively on contractors in iraq and afghanistan to undertake reconstruction projects , provide security for u.s. government officials and facilities , and support u.s. forces .
during fiscal year 2008 and the first half of fiscal year 2009 , dod , state , and usaid reported obligating $38.6 billion on contracts in iraq and afghanistan .
specifically , we analyzed ( 1 ) the extent to which dod , state , and usaid rely on contractors to perform administration functions for other contracts and grants in iraq and afghanistan ; ( 2 ) the reasons behind decisions to use contractors to perform these functions and whether the decisions are guided by strategic workforce planning ; and ( 3 ) whether the agencies have considered and mitigated conflict of interest and oversight risks related to contractors performing contract or grant administration functions .
additionally , oversight of grantees is critical to creating and sustaining performance accountability .
in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , congress directed us to report annually on dod , state , and usaid contracts in iraq and afghanistan , including information on any specific contract or class of contracts that the comptroller general determines raises issues of significant concern .
pursuant to that mandate , this report addresses dod , state , and usaid's use of contractors , including personal services contractors , to perform administration functions for other contracts or grants with performance in iraq and afghanistan during fiscal year 2008 and the first half of fiscal year 2009 .
in addition , reliance on contractor support to meet agency missions can increase the risk of conflicts of interest among companies and individuals , particularly for cases in which contractors closely support inherently governmental functions .
in some cases , the government has turned to contractors to help support its performance of contract and grant administration functions .
using contractors to support these functions can provide benefits , such as flexibility to meet immediate needs , but it can also introduce risks the government needs to consider and manage .
we have previously reported on problems with the administration of these contracts and grants , including a shortage of government personnel to monitor performance .
contract and grant administration functions represent the government's primary mechanism for assessing whether it is getting the expected products or services from contractors or whether grantees are performing in accordance with grant programs .
examples of such functions include on - site monitoring of contractor activities , supporting contracting and program offices on contract - related matters , and awarding grants and monitoring grantee performance .
for example , contractors performing certain contract or grant administration functions may closely support the performance of inherently governmental functions , which increases the risk that government decisions will be inappropriately influenced by , rather than independent from , contractor actions .
to determine the extent to which dod , state , and usaid relied on contractors to perform functions within our scope , we requested data from the agencies on contracts and task orders with at least 1 day of performance in fiscal year 2008 or the first half of fiscal year 2009 for which duties included administration functions for other contracts or grants with performance in iraq or afghanistan .
