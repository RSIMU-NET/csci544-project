these agencies — the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , and the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) — expended nearly $1.7 billion and devoted nearly 15,000 staff in fiscal year 2003 , the most recent year for which the agencies could provide complete expenditure data , on activities that included ( 1 ) inspecting food manufacturers , processors and warehouses ; ( 2 ) researching and implementing methods to reduce the prevalence of foodborne pathogens ; ( 3 ) assessing risks posed by various food contaminants ; and ( 4 ) educating industry about new regulatory requirements and the public about food safety issues .
multiple federal agencies are involved in food safety activities , but four agencies play key roles and invest the largest share of resources to ensure the safety and quality of food .
as the comptroller general noted in testimony before the congress , redundant , unfocused , and uncoordinated programs waste scarce resources , confuse and frustrate program customers , and limit overall program effectiveness .
over the years , we have documented many problems resulting from the fragmented nature of the federal food safety system and have recommended streamlining food safety statutes and consolidating food safety functions into a single agency .
the food safety challenges are more pressing today as we face the potential threat of deliberate contamination of our food supply .
in addition , the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 ( the bioterrorism act ) gave fda the authority to commission other federal officials to inspect fda - regulated foods .
we are making seven recommendations designed to reduce or eliminate duplication and overlaps , leverage existing resources , and enhance coordination efforts among the principal federal food safety agencies .
as a result , federal agencies are spending resources on similar activities to ensure that the food supply is safe , wholesome , and appropriately labeled .
these agencies operate under 30 primary laws underpinning the legal framework for ensuring the safety and quality of the food supply .
epa and nmfs also have related food safety and quality responsibilities .
of the federal agencies involved in food safety activities , usda and fda have most of the regulatory responsibility for overseeing industry's compliance with federal regulations to ensure food safety and also account for most federal spending in this area .
usda and fda enforce their respective hazard analysis and critical control point ( haccp ) regulations .

technological and scientific advances have made some provisions of these agreements obsolete .
because of your continuing interest in the efficient and effective use of government resources , you asked us to ( 1 ) identify overlaps that may exist in federal food safety functions and activities , ( 2 ) examine the extent to which federal food safety agencies are using interagency agreements to leverage existing resources and reduce any such overlaps , and ( 3 ) obtain the views of regulated industry and other stakeholders regarding opportunities to reduce overlap by consolidating federal food safety functions .
the statutory framework underlying the u.s. federal food safety system gives responsibility for specific food commodities to different agencies and provides them with significantly different authorities and responsibilities .
