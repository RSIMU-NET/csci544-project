to facilitate improvements in program integrity , the cms administrator should propose legislation permitting the reassignment of benefits to staffing companies that retain contractor physicians to treat medicare beneficiaries and requiring that these companies seek enrollment in medicare .
in order to enhance medicare's program integrity , congress may wish to amend the social security act to ( 1 ) permit the reassignment of benefits to staffing companies that retain contractor physicians to treat medicare beneficiaries so that cms may enroll these companies if they meet appropriate criteria and ( 2 ) require these staffing companies to seek enrollment in medicare .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency responsible for administering the medicare program , determines , consistent with medicare law , when and under what arrangements physicians can enroll in , and therefore directly bill , the program for services .
although staffing companies that retain contractor physicians cannot directly bill medicare , they nonetheless indirectly receive medicare funds .
as a result , these staffing companies may have less incentive than enrolled providers to ensure that the program is billed properly .
some hospitals rely on medical groups , such as physician partnerships , to ensure this coverage , while others utilize staffing companies to provide physician services .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we examined emergency department billings and focused this report on ( 1 ) whether staffing companies' contractor physicians bill medicare similarly to emergency department physicians with other affiliations , such as those practicing in partnerships , medical groups , or employee - based staffing companies , and ( 2 ) how cms's ability to monitor medicare billings has been affected by the lack of information linking contractor physicians to their staffing companies .
although hospitals may employ individual physicians to provide care , they can rely on other staffing arrangements to ensure adequate physician coverage in their emergency departments .
finally , we reviewed applicable laws , regulations , and other guidance concerning medicare enrollment and claims processing .
in addition to our claims analysis , we interviewed cms officials to discuss medicare enrollment policies and procedures as well as the program integrity implications of enrolling staffing companies that retain contractor physicians in medicare .
the fiscal integrity of the medicare program is partially dependent on cms's ability to effectively identify and investigate aberrant billing patterns among providers to hold these providers accountable .
some staffing companies are small and serve local or regional markets , while others are large and provide physicians to hospitals nationwide .
among other things , it specifically directed us to assess the program integrity implications of enrolling staffing companies that retain contractor physicians .
however , the staffing companies have typically made arrangements with these physicians to transfer their payments for these medicare claims to the staffing companies .
staffing companies are businesses that recruit physicians , verify medical credentials , and provide physicians to staff hospital departments , including emergency departments .
in 2000 , medicare — the federal health insurance program that serves the nation's elderly and disabled — paid for about 16 million visits to hospital emergency departments .
recent legislation required that we study the medicare provider enrollment process as it relates to contractor physicians with a particular emphasis on hospital - based physicians , such as those retained by emergency department staffing companies .
