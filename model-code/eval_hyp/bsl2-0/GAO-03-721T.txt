my remarks today will focus on sba's ( 1 ) response to the september 11 terrorist attacks ; ( 2 ) performance plans and measures for its disaster loan program ; and ( 3 ) loan asset sales program , which involves selling disaster and other loans .
in reviewing sba's loan sales program , which includes disaster loans , we identified three areas needing improvement: tracking borrower inquiries and complaints ; sales budgeting and accounting , which affect the reliability of sba financial statements and budget information ; and reporting on the operational benefits of the loan sales .
notwithstanding sba's extraordinary performance in responding to the september 11 attacks , our work showed that the disaster loan program's performance measures do not fully or adequately reflect sba's actual performance .
the unique nature of the attacks and the government's response required sba to make unprecedented efforts to expand its disaster lending coverage and to be flexible in its efforts to serve those needing assistance .
my comments are based on our recent reports on sba's disaster loan program ( small business administration: response to september 11 victims and performance measure for disaster lending , gao - 03-385 , jan. 29 , 2003 ) and loan asset sales program ( small business administration: accounting anomalies and limited operational data make results of loan sales uncertain , gao - 03-87 , jan. 3 , 2003 ) .
i am pleased to be with you today at this roundtable to discuss the role of the small business administration's ( sba ) disaster loan program in responding to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , general performance measures for the program , and the effects of sba's program to sell loans to private investors on disaster loans and their borrowers .
as you know , the effects of the september 11 attacks were felt not only in new york but also around our country , with the economic damage occurring in states as far west as california .

second , we recommended that sba revise and expand its current research to improve its measures and evaluate program impact .
we identified several problems with these measures .
we made two recommendations designed to help sba improve its performance measures for disaster lending .
first , we recommended that sba revise the performance measures to include more outcome measures ; assess more significant outputs , such as service to applicants or loan underwriting ; report achievements that can be compared over several years , such as percentages ; and include performance targets that encourage process improvement rather than maintaining past levels of performance .
like other federal programs , sba's disaster loan program follows performance measurement guidelines under the government performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993 .
