first , i will address the problems we are having in obtaining access to department of defense ( dod ) information that we need regarding these competitions to meet our reporting responsibilities under the 1998 defense authorization act .
in relation to those responsibilities , i will also discuss the recent competition for c - 5 aircraft workload and our assessment of it ; the adequacy of dod's support for its determination that competing combined , rather than individual workloads of each maintenance depot is more logical and economical ; and concerns participants have raised about the upcoming competitions for the workloads at the air logistics centers in sacramento , california , and san antonio , texas .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to the public - private competitions for workloads at two maintenance depots identified for closure during the 1995 base realignment and closure process .
before i discuss specifics , i will summarize the key points in my testimony .
further , we discussed competition issues with potential public and private sector participants .
privatization - in - place was one initiative for retaining these employment goals .
mr. chairman , we are working diligently to meet the committee's mandates and to safeguard sensitive air force information that is necessary to accomplish this work .
during 1997 , congress continued to oversee dod's strategy for allocating workloads currently performed at the closing depots .
for example , total estimated direct and indirect cost and savings to dod must be considered in any evaluation .
our lack of access to information is seriously impairing our ability to carry out our reporting responsibilities under this act .
to mitigate the impact of the closures on the local communities and center employees , in 1995 the administration announced its decision to maintain certain employment levels at these locations .
the 1998 defense authorization act required that we and dod analyze various issues related to the competitions at the closing depots and report to congress concerning several areas .
we have had problems in gaining access to information required to respond to reporting requirements under the 1998 national defense authorization act .
first , within 60 days of its enactment , the defense authorization act requires us to review the c - 5 aircraft workload competition and subsequent award to the warner robins air logistics center and report to congress on whether ( 1 ) the procedures used provided an equal opportunity for offerors without regard to performance location ; ( 2 ) are in compliance with applicable law and the far ; and ( 3 ) whether the award results in the lowest total cost to dod .
dod issued these reports on february 3 , 1998 .
as required by the 1998 act , we will evaluate the solicitations once issued , in the context of the views of the relevant parties to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations .
as noted , the solicitations are still in draft form .
other questions concern whether multiple workloads should be packaged in a single solicitation and whether the inclusion of multiple workloads could prevent some otherwise qualified sources from competing .
these participants raised several concerns that they believe may affect the competitions .
