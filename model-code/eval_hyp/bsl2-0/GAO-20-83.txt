however , va has identified racial and ethnic disparities in its health care outcomes , mirroring trends seen across the united states .
as its veterans' population is becoming increasingly more diverse , va has acknowledged the importance of ensuring health equity — the ability for all veterans to attain their highest possible levels of health .
we make the following two recommendations to va: the under secretary for health should ensure that any action plan for achieving health equity includes key elements for successful implementation by consistently applying criteria identified in gao's past work on effectively managing performance , including developing performance measures to assess progress and creating clear lines of accountability by designating specific offices or officials with responsibility for coordinating efforts to implement actions and committing resources necessary for achieving its goals and objectives .
 ( recommendation 2 ) .
we also reviewed the commission on care report , a 2016 report that included recommendations for improving va's health care system , including its efforts to address health equity and disparities .
we reviewed va - funded research related to identifying and reducing disparities in health care outcomes .
we also assessed the efforts of ohe to implement the health equity action plan , va's action plan to address health equity across the agency .
additionally , minority veterans' use of va's health care services increased about 9 percent from 2005 to 2014 , according to the most recent va data available .
 ( recommendation 1 ) to ensure the availability of information on health care outcomes by race and ethnicity throughout the va health care system , the secretary of veterans affairs should conduct an assessment to determine the completeness and accuracy of race and ethnicity data captured in va's electronic health record , and implement corrective actions as necessary to resolve any identified deficiencies .
despite these efforts , however , without including performance measures or lines of accountability , va lacks the means to ensure any action plan will be fully implemented to achieve its goals .
a report accompanying the military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations bill , 2018 , included a provision for us to review whether va provides quality , equitable health care for minority veterans , among other things .
more recently , in 2019 , va reported evidence of disparities in health care outcomes within va medical centers in the form of lower survival rates for african american veterans with cancer and cardiovascular - related illnesses compared with other minority veterans and white veterans .
va has taken several steps in recent years to reduce health care disparities for minority veterans and advance health equity , but lacks mechanisms to ensure accountability for advancing health equity using these or other actions .
in 2016 , racial and ethnic minority veterans — hereafter referred to as minority veterans — comprised about 22 percent of the total veteran population of 18.6 million ; va projects minority veterans will make up 36 percent of its total veteran population by 2040 .
for example , in 2011 , va found outcomes for controlling blood pressure , blood glucose , and cholesterol levels were significantly worse for black or african american veterans than they were for white veterans .
