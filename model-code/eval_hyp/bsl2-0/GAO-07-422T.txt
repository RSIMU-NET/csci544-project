from 2000 to 2005 , the program has grown from $15 billion in benefits provided to 17 million individuals to $29 billion in benefits to nearly 26 million individuals .
however , in recent years , the food stamp program has grown tremendously .
fns has taken advantage of electronic benefit transfer ( ebt ) and other new technology to improve its ability to detect trafficking and disqualify retailers who traffic , while law enforcement agencies have investigated and referred for prosecution a decreasing number of traffickers , instead focusing their efforts on fewer high - impact investigations .
usda's food and nutrition service ( fns ) and the states jointly implement the food stamp program , which is to be reauthorized after it expires in fiscal year 2007 .
to reduce program vulnerabilities and ensure limited compliance - monitoring resources are used efficiently , gao recommended in its october 2006 trafficking report that fns take additional steps to target and provide early oversight of stores most likely to traffic ; develop a strategy to increase penalties for trafficking , working with the inspector general as needed ; and promote state efforts to pursue recipients suspected of trafficking .
if the 1999 error rate had been in effect in 2005 , the program would have made payment errors totaling over $2.8 billion rather than the $1.7 billion it experienced .
studies suggest that economic growth in the late 1990s played a major role in this decrease .
fns and the states we reviewed have taken many approaches to improving food stamp payment accuracy , most of which are similar to internal control practices known to reduce improper payments .
in summary , both payment errors and trafficking of benefits have declined in a time of rising participation , and although progress has been made , ensuring program integrity remains a fundamental challenge facing the food stamp program .
the information i am presenting today is based primarily on findings from our past work on two issues related to ensuring integrity of the program: ( 1 ) improper payments to food stamp participants , and ( 2 ) trafficking in food stamp benefits .
participation in the program has been cyclical , with a decrease in the number of recipients for a few years beginning in 1996 .
despite the progress fns has made in combating retailer trafficking , the food stamp program remains vulnerable because retailers can enter the program intending to traffic and do so , often without fear of severe criminal penalties , as the declining number of investigations referred for prosecution suggests .
as you know , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food stamp program is intended to help low - income individuals and families obtain a better diet by supplementing their income with benefits to purchase food .
in addition to declining payment error , fns estimates suggest that the national rate of food stamp trafficking declined from about 3.8 cents per dollar of benefits redeemed in 1993 to about 1.0 cent per dollar during the years 2002 to 2005 and that trafficking occurs more frequently in smaller stores .
these efforts were conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
the national payment error rate for the program combines states' overpayments and underpayments to program participants and has declined by about 40 percent between 1999 and 2005 , from 9.86 percent to a record low of 5.84 percent .
