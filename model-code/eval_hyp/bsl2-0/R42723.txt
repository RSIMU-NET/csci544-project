on january 6 , 2011 , after spending approximately $3 billion in developmental funding , the marine corps — with "encouragement" from dod — cancelled the expeditionary fighting vehicle ( efv ) program .
the amphibious combat vehicle ( acv ) is intended to replace the aav , incorporating some efv capabilities but in a more practical and cost - efficient manner .
congress is responsible for authorizing and appropriating funds for all weapon systems programs , including the acv .
the acv and mpc were considered integral systems by the department of defense ( dod ) and marine corps to meet this legal requirement , as well as providing critical capabilities to execute the nation's military strategy .
the marine corps cancelled the efv due to excessive cost growth and poor performance in operational testing .
cost is another issue of interest to congress .
another possible congressional concern is to what extent a robust amphibious assault capability is a necessary component of u.s. national security .
the need to maintain an amphibious assault capability is viewed by marine corps leadership as establishing the requirement for the acv and mpc ( as discussed in greater detail below ) .
with the marines involved in decades - long land conflicts in iraq and afghanistan and proliferating anti - access technologies such as guided missiles , some analysts questioned whether the marines would ever again be called on to conduct a large - scale amphibious assault operation .
recognizing the need to replace the aav , the pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a "more affordable and sustainable" vehicle to take the place of the efv .
in its oversight role , congress could be concerned about how the acv enables the marines to conduct not only amphibious operations but also operations ashore .
although some have questioned why the marines cannot simply "adopt" a u.s. army personnel carrier , marine requirements for a personnel carrier reflect the need for this vehicle to be compatible with amphibious assault craft , as well as to have an enhanced amphibious capability , which is not necessarily an army requirement .
the mpc was not intended to be amphibious like an aav , efv , or the acv but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers , lakes , and other water obstacles such as shore - to - shore operations in the littorals .
the efv was intended to replace the 40-year - old amphibious assault vehicle ( aav ) , which currently transports marines from ships to shore under hostile conditions .
in this regard , the marines are required by law to have the necessary equipment to conduct amphibious operations and land operations .
in june 2013 , citing budgetary pressures , the marines reportedly put the mpc program "on ice" and suggested that it might not be resurrected for about 10 years .
in response to these questions and the perceived need to examine the post - iraq and afghanistan marine corps , the department of the navy and dod studied the requirement to conduct large - scale amphibious operations and in early 2012 released a strategic vision for how amphibious operations will be conducted in the future .
