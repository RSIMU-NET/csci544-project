in view of the increasing threat of unauthorized intrusions into department of defense computer systems , you asked us to report on the extent to which defense computer systems are being attacked , the actual and potential damage to its information and systems , and the challenges defense is facing in securing sensitive information .
copies will also be made available to others upon request .
if you have any questions about this report , please call me at ( 202 ) 512-6240 .
other major contributors to this report are listed in appendix i .
this network environment offers defense tremendous opportunities for streamlining operations and improving efficiency , but also greatly increases the risks of unauthorized access to information .
these steps include strengthening ( 1 ) computer security policies and procedures , ( 2 ) security training and staffing , and ( 3 ) detection and reaction programs .
federal law enforcement agencies are likewise initiating more investigations of computer systems intrusions , based on the rising level of internet - related security breaches and crimes .
similarly , security technologies and products are being developed and used to enhance internet security .
as depicted in figure 1.1 , the department of defense has a vast information infrastructure of computers and networks to protect including over 2.1 million computers , 10,000 local networks , 100 long - distance networks , 200 command centers , and 16 central computer processing facilities or megacenters .
though clearly beneficial , the internet also poses serious computer security concerns for defense and other government and commercial organizations .
there are over 2 million defense computer users and an additional two million non - defense users that do business with the department .
these systems have also become increasingly interconnected worldwide to form virtual communities in cyberspace .
the department calls its portion of this global community the defense information infrastructure .
the systems are attractive targets for individuals and organizations seeking monetary gain , or dedicated to damaging defense and its operations .
many defense and information technology experts predict that defense will increase its reliance on internet in the future .
as a result of the rapid growth in computer technology , the department of defense , like the rest of government and the private sector , has become extremely dependent on automated information systems .
however , as new security tools are developed , hackers quickly learn how to defeat them or exploit other vulnerabilities .
as discussed in chapter 2 , defense systems contain very valuable and sensitive information including commercial transactions , payrolls , sensitive research data , intelligence , operational plans , procurement sensitive source selection data , health records , personnel records , and weapons systems maintenance records .
