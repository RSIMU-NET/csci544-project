in fiscal year 2000 , these corporations administered funds amounting to $174 million , or about 15 percent of va's total medical research dollars .
since va's nonprofit corporations were first established , there has been limited oversight of their operations and contributions to va research .
for example , the va inspector general's last major review of the program occurred in 1994 , when va was cited for failing to provide adequate policies and guidance relating to budgeting , accounting , and oversight of these corporations .
the authority to establish private nonprofit research corporations , contained in the veterans' benefits and services act of 1988 , provides a flexible funding mechanism for , among other things , hiring and contracting for goods and services for certain medical center research .
my testimony today will focus on ( 1 ) the benefits nonprofit research corporations provide to va , ( 2 ) processes to detect individual and institutional conflicts of interest within nonprofit research corporations , and ( 3 ) nonprofit research corporations' financial activities and how they are monitored by va. to conduct our work , we visited 5 of the 88 nonprofit corporations based on their dollar revenues for 2000 .
on may 16 , 2002 , this subcommittee , along with the subcommittee on health , conducted a hearing on va's nonprofit research corporations .
we also interviewed officials from federal agencies that provide funds to va nonprofit research corporations , including the national institutes of health ( nih ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of defense ( dod ) .
we also reviewed va's annual reports on nonprofit research corporations' activities for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 , and relevant legislation and regulations .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) nonprofit research corporations , which receive funds primarily from non - va sources to conduct medical research at va facilities .
we compared and analyzed data from each of the five nonprofit research corporations' audited financial statements to their internal revenue service ( irs ) tax forms for 2000 and 2001 , along with general ledger account balances and supporting documentation for revenues and expenses .
to detect conflicts of interest , investigators on research projects administered by va nonprofit corporations are subject to federal statutes and regulations applicable to federal employees concerning conduct and conflicts of interest and may be required to disclose their financial interests .
they design and control research projects and frequently have dual appointments with the va medical centers' affiliated universities .
va has delegated responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the activities of nonprofit corporations to the directors of va medical centers , however , va headquarters does not oversee and monitor corporations' financial activities and ensure that identified deficiencies are corrected .
institutional conflicts of interest are unlikely to occur in va's nonprofit research corporations because they cannot own stock , have an equity interest in private companies , or obtain intellectual property rights .
in summary , we found the following: nonprofit corporations support va's research environment by funding a portion of the department's research needs , such as laboratory equipment and improvements to infrastructure , and by providing flexible personnel and contracting arrangements to respond to investigators' needs .
