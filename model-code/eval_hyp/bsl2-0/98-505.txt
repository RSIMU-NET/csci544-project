congress may modify , rescind , or render dormant such delegated emergency authority .
in 1976 , congress curtailed this practice with the passage of the national emergencies act .
these activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the vietnam war .
others — statutory delegations from congress — exist on a standby basis and remain dormant until the president formally declares a national emergency .
they are not limited to military or war situations .
sometimes such proclamations confined the matter of crisis to a specific policy sphere , and sometimes they placed no limitation whatsoever on the pronouncement .
until the crisis of world war i , presidents utilized emergency powers at their own discretion .
some of these authorities , deriving from the constitution or statutory law , are continuously available to the president with little or no qualification .
proclamations announced the exercise of exigency authority .
f ederal law provides a variety of powers for the president to use in response to crisis , exigency , or emergency circumstances threatening the nation .
during world war i and thereafter , chief executives had available to them a growing body of standby emergency authority that became operative upon the issuance of a proclamation declaring a condition of national emergency .
since its enactment the national emergencies act has not been revisited by congressional overseers .
during congressional committee hearings on emergency powers in 1973 , a political scientist described an emergency in the following terms: "it denotes the existence of conditions of varying nature , intensity and duration , which are perceived to threaten life or well - being beyond tolerable limits. .
the first is its temporal character: an emergency is sudden , unforeseen , and of unknown duration .
it may be argued , however , that the granting of emergency powers by congress is implicit in its article i , section 8 , authority to "provide for the common defense and general welfare ; " the commerce clause ; its war , armed forces , and militia powers ; and the "necessary and proper" clause empowering it to make such laws as are required to fulfill the executions of "the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states , or in any department or officer thereof. .
at the constitutional convention of 1787 , emergency powers , as such , failed to attract much attention during the course of debate over the charter for the new government .
relying upon constitutional authority or congressional delegations made at various times over the past 230 years , the president of the united states may exercise certain powers in the event that the continued existence of the nation is threatened by crisis , exigency , or emergency circumstances .
the second is its potential gravity: an emergency is dangerous and threatening to life and well - being .
there are at least four aspects of an emergency condition .
corwin also indicated it "connotes the existence of conditions suddenly intensifying the degree of existing danger to life or well - being beyond that which is accepted as normal. .
from these simple factors arise the dynamics of national emergency powers .
