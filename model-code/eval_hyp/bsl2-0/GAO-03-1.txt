gao recommends that the national invasive species council ( 1 ) incorporate data on the economic impacts of invasive species in developing the federal government's budget ; ( 2 ) add performance - oriented goals and objectives to its updated plan ; ( 3 ) give high priority to an oversight strategy for measuring progress against results - oriented goals ; and ( 4 ) examine whether the council is being hampered in its implementation of the plan by the lack of specific legislation .
while the national invasive species management plan calls for many actions that are likely to contribute to preventing and controlling invasive species in the united states , it does not clearly articulate specific long - term goals toward which the government should strive .
new initiatives may prompt more comprehensive analysis that could help decision makers make better resource allocations .
the continued introduction of invasive species could have high economic and ecological costs for the great lakes .
the united states and canada are working on strengthening the existing control system , but developing stronger regulations and the technology needed to meet them will take many years .
conservation biologists rank invasive species as the second most serious threat to endangered species after habitat destruction .
existing literature on the economic impacts of invasive species is of limited usefulness to decision makers , although it indicates that the effects of invasive species are significant .
in addition , the federal government has made little progress in implementing the actions called for by the plan .
this report discusses the economic impacts of invasive species , implementation of the management plan , and coordination of u.s. and canadian efforts to control invasive species , including those introduced to the great lakes via the ballast water of ships .
agencies generally agreed with gao's recommendations .
in 2001 , the federal government issued a national invasive species management plan to focus attention on invasive species and coordinate a national control effort involving the 20 or so federal agencies that are responsible for managing them .
most economic estimates do not consider all of the relevant effects of nonnative species or the future risks that they pose .
even with high levels of compliance , u.s. regulations have not eliminated the introduction of invasive species into the great lakes via the ballast water of ships .
some have termed invasive species “biological pollutants.” unlike some chemical pollutants that can degrade over time , biological pollutants have the potential to persist , multiply , and spread .
in addition to their economic costs , invasive species can have a devastating effect on natural areas , where they have strangled native plants , taken over wetland habitats , crowded out native species , and deprived waterfowl and other species of food sources .
overall , scientists , academicians , and industry leaders are recognizing invasive species as one of the most serious environmental threats of the twenty - first century .
the order directs federal agencies to take actions that will prevent the introduction of invasive species ; provide for their control ; and minimize their impact on the economy , the environment , and human health .
harmful invasive species — nonnative plants and animals that are spreading throughout the united states — have caused billions of dollars in damage to natural areas , businesses , and consumers .
