under that mandate , this review examines the extent to which: ( 1 ) dod manages and oversees the full scope and cost of the isr enterprise ; ( 2 ) dod identified and minimized the potential for any unnecessary duplication in program , planning , and operations for isr ; and ( 3 ) dod's isr integration roadmap addresses key management elements required by law or directed by congressional committees .
as demand for isr has increased and dod has moved quickly to develop and acquire new isr capabilities , integrating and managing dod's isr enterprise has become more complex and challenging .
in fiscal year 2010 , intelligence spending across the national and military intelligence communities — which includes isr — exceeded $80 billion .
in january 2011 , congress expressed the need to continue with oversight over certain isr efforts given the growth and demand of isr .
the success of isr systems in collecting , processing , and disseminating useful intelligence information has fueled growing demand for more isr support , and the department of defense ( dod ) has increased its investments in isr capabilities significantly since 2002 .
to determine the full scope and cost of dod's isr enterprise we assessed dod's isr funding and budget elements reported in the military intelligence program , analyzed dod's isr spending plans in the future years defense program , and conducted discussions with dod , military service , and intelligence agency officials regarding isr funding and capabilities .
since 2004 , congress and we have reported on the need for greater integration and efficiencies across dod's isr enterprise .
a new statutory requirement mandates that gao identify federal programs , agencies , offices , and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities within departments and governmentwide .
in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 , congress required dod to develop a fully integrated isr roadmap and coordinate activities across the military services , defense agencies , and combatant commands .
expand the scope of current efficiency efforts to include isr collection activities .
we have also reported that isr activities are not integrated and efficient ; effectiveness may be compromised by lack of full visibility into operational use of isr assets ; and agencies could better collaborate in the acquisition of new capabilities .
we evaluated the extent to which dod took actions to resolve instances of fragmentation and duplication they identified by reviewing isr capability assessments and recent isr efficiency initiatives .
in september 2010 , the deputy secretary of defense acknowledged that the growth of intelligence organizations within dod has not been centrally directed or managed and there is a high probability that inefficiencies exist .
although dod has designated the under secretary of defense for intelligence ( usd ) to manage isr investments as a departmentwide portfolio , the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics has been designated to lead the task force responsible for oversight of issues related to the management and acquisition of unmanned aircraft systems that collect isr data .
we also reviewed guidance related to dod's recent efficiency initiatives including memorandums and directives .
we evaluated dod's guidance to determine to what extent it incorporated best practices we previously identified , such as developing performance metrics , timelines , and goals for implementation of efficiency efforts .
