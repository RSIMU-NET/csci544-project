billions of dollars in federal grant funds are also allotted to states and localities based on their relative share of the nation's poor population .
finally , recent house and senate legislative proposals to create a new "modern" poverty measure , and more recent developments initiated by the office of management and budget ( omb ) proposing a new supplemental poverty measure , are reviewed in the context of the current "official" measure and the nas panel recommendations .
more recently , the department of commerce economic and statistics administration , under an omb sponsored initiative , announced that the census bureau , in coordination with the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , will develop a supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) , using nas panel recommendations and subsequent research as a framework .
it has served as a yardstick by which the economic progress of the most economically disadvantaged members of society has been gauged , and the effects of social programs assessed .
many experts consider the measure of poverty currently being used as the "official measure" as flawed and outmoded .
a congressionally commissioned study conducted by the national academy of sciences ( nas ) national research council ( nrc ) panel provided a wide range of specific recommendations to revamp the statistical measure of poverty used in the united states in its 1995 report , measuring poverty: a new approach .
a second definition of poverty , closely related to the statistical definition and issued as "federal poverty guidelines" by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is used for administrative purposes , such as determining income eligibility of individuals , families , and households for federal and state programs .
subsequently , alternative estimates to the current poverty measure using variants of the nas panel's recommendations are presented .
the proposed measure will supplement , rather than replace , the current poverty measure , which will continue to be deemed the "official" statistical measure of poverty in the united states .
it will then present the nas panel's major recommendations to address perceived flaws in the "official" measure and to develop a new u.s. measure of poverty .
some of the conceptual , technical , and methodological issues relating to the implementation of a nas - based poverty measure are then discussed .
census bureau estimates of the number of people with incomes below poverty are also used to distribute federal funds to states under various programs' grant formulas .
legislation introduced in the 110 th and 111 th congress , if adopted , would instruct the census bureau to implement many of the nas panel's recommendations in a new "modern" poverty measure .
since then , an extensive amount of research has been undertaken by statistical agencies , academics , and other researchers to devise and test methods , and evaluate the results of implementing the nas panel's recommendations .
the existing u.s. poverty measure evolved well over 40 years ago , in tandem with the advent of the "great society" and "war on poverty" programs .
this report will provide a brief history of precursor events and studies that led to a rediscovery of poverty in the united states and the development and adoption of an "official" statistical measure to measure the phenomenon and to weigh progress toward its eradication .
