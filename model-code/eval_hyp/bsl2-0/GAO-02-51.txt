early emphasis by the department on research and initiatives to cope with the global energy crisis quickly shifted to accelerated nuclear weapons production .
concerned about the progress that doe has made to strengthen its management in recent years , you asked us to describe actions taken by doe to improve its performance in the early to assess doe progress since then in addressing management weaknesses and improving performance , and identify any underlying impediments to more effective management and improved performance at doe .
doe also has a role in helping to ensure the security of the nation's energy infrastructure .
these diverse missions are largely implemented by contractors to carry out doe's program and project activities at government - owned facilities and sites across the country .
however , by the late 1980s , doe funding priorities again shifted to cleaning up the legacy of waste generated by the weapons complex , and this work remains doe's largest budget category .
the department contracts out about 94 percent of its budget and has established an extensive network of field offices to directly oversee the work of these contractors and address other departmental responsibilities .
to address these objectives , among other steps , we examined more than 200 audits and reviews conducted since 1995 on various aspects of doe's activities .
since then , doe has placed increased emphasis on basic scientific research .
the relative emphasis given to these missions has changed over time .
responding to calls for restructuring , by 1995 doe initiated “unprecedented” reforms that it said would “fundamentally improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the department.” created in 1977 from diverse agencies , doe manages the nation's nuclear weapons production complex , cleans up the environmental legacy from the production of nuclear weapons , and conducts research and development on both energy and basic science .
recurring problems in managing its programs and projects plagued the department of energy ( doe ) to such a degree in the late 1980s and early 1990s that some observers , including gao , called for a rethinking of the department's missions and structure .
the result is a department with complex and diverse missions .
 ( see app .
these reviews , which are listed in appendix ii , were conducted by doe's inspector general , internal and external ad - hoc bodies and consultants , and us .
while many of doe's reforms have achieved their immediate objectives , weaknesses persist and have been linked to wide - ranging performance problems , including major cost overruns and schedule delays in a variety of noteworthy projects .
we supplemented our analysis by visiting and holding discussions with officials in the doe headquarters and field offices responsible for each of the department's major mission areas .
since its inception , funding priorities for the department's varied mission responsibilities have shifted and new challenges have been added .

national nuclear security follows , with 25 percent of the budget ( about $5 billion ) .
in fiscal year 2000 , the environmental quality business line was the department's largest budget category , accounting for approximately 34 percent ( about $6.7 billion ) of its $19.7 billion budget .
