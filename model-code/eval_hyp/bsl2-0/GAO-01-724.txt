federal invasive species activities include prevention ( efforts to keep invasive species from entering the country ) , detection ( surveillance for invasive species ) , and control ( measures to eradicate or limit the spread of invasive species ) .
over 20 federal agencies — including the u.s .
departments of agriculture ( usda ) , commerce , defense , and the interior — have responsibility for some aspect of invasive species management .
increased travel and global trade have resulted in growing numbers of invasive species gaining entry into the united states .
usda , and primarily its animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) , has the largest federal role .
in fiscal year 2000 , usda spent about $556 million on a wide range of invasive species - related activities — almost 90 percent of the total federal funding directed toward these activities .
among other things , the plan was to ( 1 ) recommend performance - oriented goals and objectives , ( 2 ) recommend measures to minimize the risk of new introductions of invasive species , and ( 3 ) review existing and prospective authorities for preventing the introduction and spread of invasive species .
species from countries such as china and russia with habitats similar to our own are especially likely to gain a foothold in the united states .
states also have a significant management role , but the extent of their involvement varies considerably .
in other instances , invasive species are brought in deliberately as ornamental plants , as pets , or for purposes such as erosion control .
the plan , issued january 18 , 2001 , contained 57 recommendations , including 3 aimed at improving the nation's ability to respond rapidly to invasive species .
expanded trade within north america has also increased the risk of spreading established invaders from one country to another .
invasive species can be new to the united states or to an ecosystem ( a community of organisms and their environment ) within the united states .
our first report — invasive species: federal and selected state funding to address harmful , nonnative species ( gao / rced - 00-219 , aug. 24 , 2000 ) — addressed federal and selected state funding for eight activities relating to invasive species .
scientists , academicians , and industry leaders are recognizing invasive species to be one of the most serious environmental threats of the 21st century .
invasive species have also had a devastating effect on natural areas , where they have strangled native flora , taken over wetland habitats , and deprived waterfowl and other species of food sources .
interior and defense accounted for another 5 percent and 2 percent , respectively .
specifically , we examined the extent to which the federal government rapidly responds to new invasive species , the obstacles that impede rapid response , and how rapid response can be improved .
since many agency officials were uncertain about what activities should be considered rapid response and their agencies did not routinely track rapid response funding , their estimates of rapid response funding may be somewhat over - or understated .
because invasive species do not respect jurisdictional boundaries , rapid response often requires cooperation among federal , state , and local government agencies , private land managers / owners , and tribal governments .
