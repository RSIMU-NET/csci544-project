official travel may involve , for example , presenting information ; giving direction ; and explaining , and securing public support for , administration policies .
it appears likely that subsequent administrations have used the reagan administration guidelines as a foundation for their own travel policies .
the travel policies of specific administrations concerning the reimbursement of expenses for unofficial travel generally are not publicly available .
the guidelines evolved in response to general legal principles that federal funds are to be used only for the purposes for which they are appropriated , opinions from the office of legal counsel in the department of justice , rules of the federal election commission ( fec ) , and occasional audits by the general accounting office ( gao ) .
attending party functions , participating in fundraising , and campaigning for candidates are examples of political activities .
political travel normally involves the president and vice president in their positions as leaders of their political party .
the guidelines , which also cover the first lady and the vice president's spouse , apply only to trips in the united states and its territories , since all foreign travel is considered official .
however , the reagan administration established written guidelines in 1982 to determine when the president , vice president , and any assistants accompanying them on military aircraft travel at government expense and when they , or the political organizations on whose behalf they travel , are to reimburse the government with the equivalent of the airfare that they would have had to pay had they traveled on commercial airlines .
the terms are rather general , and the white house determines whether a trip is for official or political purposes , or for a combination of the two .
official , or nonpolitical , travel is normally defined as anything having to do with the carrying out of presidential duties and responsibilities .
trips by the president , vice president , and first lady are almost always classified as official travel or political travel , or a combination of the two .
these estimates involved operational costs ; they did not include per diem and other travel - related expenses .
most of the costs involve operational costs of the aircraft , and include fuel , maintenance , engineering support , and per diem expenses for the crew .
when white house personnel are on official travel , certain personal expenses , which include per diem ( food and lodging ) , car rentals , and other incidentals , are paid by the government .
in 1999 , gao estimated the incremental costs , including per diem and related expenses , of presidential trips in 1998 to africa , chile , and china to be at least $42.8 million , $10.5 million , and $18.8 million respectively .
these expenses are paid by the white house for domestic travel , and by the state department for foreign travel .
among the aircraft in the 89 aw are two boeing 747s ( also known as vc - 25as ) that have been specially configured for the president's needs , and that are exclusively for his use .
airfare and related travel expenses associated with the trips taken by the president , vice president , and first lady are only a fraction of the total cost of such trips .
