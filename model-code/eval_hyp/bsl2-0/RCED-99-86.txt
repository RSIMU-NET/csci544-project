reflecting congressional interest in brownfields , you asked us to ( 1 ) compare federal agencies' planned financial assistance to brownfields , as stated in the partnership agenda , to their actual spending for brownfields in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 ; ( 2 ) describe the purposes of these obligations ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which agencies met the partnership's goals and objectives .
these actions and this investment were to result in three specific economic outcomes — leveraging an additional $5 billion to $28 billion in private investments in brownfields , creating up to 196,000 new jobs , and protecting up to 34,000 acres of greenfields .
under the partnership initiative , more than 20 federal agencies were to better coordinate their brownfield resources and activities , specifically carrying out more than 100 action items involving brownfields that would , among other things , generate $469 million in federal financial assistance — $304 million predominantly in grants to local communities , and $165 million in loan guarantees .
we collected financial data and documentation of brownfield activities and met with the senior managers involved with brownfields from 10 partnership agencies that are involved in these activities: the departments of agriculture , defense's u.s. army corps of engineers , energy , health and human services , housing and urban development , and transportation , the economic development , the national oceanic and atmospheric , and the general services administrations , and the environmental protection agency .
in response to communities' requests for federal assistance to address brownfields , in may 1997 the administration announced the brownfield national partnership action agenda , a 2-year initiative to bring federal , state , and local agencies together to clean up and redevelop these sites .
eight of these 10 agencies were responsible for 100 percent of the planned financial assistance outlined in the partnership agenda .
however , this trend contributes to urban blight , “suburban sprawl,” and a reduced tax and employment base in traditional urban centers .
in some cases , rather than face the potentially high costs to clean up the contamination at brownfields and any future liability for it , businesses have looked to greenfields — undeveloped sites in rural and suburban areas — for expansion and new development .
since the early 1990s , federal , state , and local governments have focused much attention on the cleanup and economic redevelopment of “brownfields” — abandoned , idle , or underused industrial and commercial facilities where real or perceived environmental contamination is a barrier to redevelopment .
appendix i includes a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology .
the administration reported that the agencies would provide a total of $469 million in financial assistance by implementing more than 100 brownfield action items and that this assistance was expected to result in the ( 1 ) leveraging of additional private investments in brownfields , ( 2 ) creation of new jobs , and ( 3 ) protection of greenfields .
the 10 federal agencies in our review have improved both their internal and external coordination of brownfield activities and have accomplished most of their respective partnership actions , thereby increasing the federal government's role in brownfield redevelopment .
