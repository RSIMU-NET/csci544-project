the program is authorized by title v of the older americans act ( oaa ) , and it received an appropriation of $396 million for fiscal year 1995 .
our objectives for this report were to examine labor's process for making scsep grant awards ; the extent to which labor's allocation of scsep funds equitably distributes the subsidized job positions ; and other administrative issues , including administrative expenses , for the program .
the 104th congress is considering proposals to consolidate and transfer to block grants many of these programs , including scsep .
in an earlier report on training programs , we identified scsep as 1 of 163 federal programs and funding sources constituting the federal effort to support employment training assistance .
earlier , you expressed concern to us about labor's process for awarding noncompetitive grants .
each year , the department of labor's senior community service employment program ( scsep ) provides grants to finance part - time , minimum - wage community service jobs for about 100,000 economically disadvantaged older americans .
to develop this information , we reviewed grant documents , the relevant oaa provisions , labor's regulations and procedures , states' reports documenting the distribution of positions within states , and labor's internal documents reporting the distribution of funds and positions to states and national sponsors .
to examine the appropriateness of expenses allocated to specific budget categories , we relied on budget data in the grant applications .
labor awards the bulk of the scsep grant funds to 10 nonprofit national sponsors and the remainder to the state governments that administer the program for the department .
our first report to you on the subject covered labor's 134 smaller grants , and this , our final planned report on the subject , covers the larger scsep program .
during our review , we also interviewed officials of labor , 28 state offices responsible for scsep activities , and each of the 10 national sponsors .
although this report does not address such proposals , its information on scsep may be useful to those considering them .
we did so because labor staff use these data in their award and approval process and because actual cost data were not available .
for further details on the scope and methodology of our work , see appendix i .
we conducted our review between april 1994 and april 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
we did not independently verify the data reported to us .
of the 1994 program year appropriation , labor allocated the national sponsors $320.2 million ( 78 percent ) and the states and territories $90.3 million ( 22 percent ) .
labor administers scsep through its employment and training administration ( eta ) .
every year since 1978 , appropriations acts have overridden the 55 / 45 provision .
the congress is reviewing proposals for reauthorization .
territories has .
of the current 10 national sponsors , 5 were added because of oaa amendments and other congressional guidance to labor , which directed that labor add sponsors oriented toward certain ethnic groups with high concentrations of the elderly poor .
during the next 13 years ( 1965-1978 ) , legislative and administrative actions instituted most of the basic aspects of today's scsep: responsibility for the program was moved to the department of labor ; the program was made part of the oaa and given the goal of providing subsidized employment in community service organizations to economically disadvantaged older americans ; all grantees were asked to attempt to place at least 10 percent of their program enrollees in unsubsidized jobs ( the goal has been 20 percent since 1985 ) ; and 8 of the eventual 10 national sponsors , as well as most state governments , were made grantees for the program .
