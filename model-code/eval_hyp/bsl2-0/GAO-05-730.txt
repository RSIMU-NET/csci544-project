in recent testimony on dod's transformation efforts , we indicated that dod is challenged in its efforts to affect fundamental business management reform , such as nsps , and indicated that our ongoing work continues to raise questions about dod's chances of success .
these practices are to ( 1 ) ensure top leadership drives the transformation , ( 2 ) establish a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide the transformation , ( 3 ) focus on a key set of principles and priorities at the outset of the transformation , ( 4 ) set implementation goals and a timeline to build momentum and show progress from day one , ( 5 ) dedicate an implementation team to manage the transformation process , ( 6 ) use the performance management system to define responsibility and assure accountability for change , ( 7 ) establish a communication strategy to create shared expectations and report related progress , ( 8 ) involve employees to obtain their ideas and gain their ownership for the transformation , and ( 9 ) build a world - class organization .
specifically , this report ( 1 ) describes dod's process to design its personnel management system , ( 2 ) analyzes the extent to which dod's process reflects key practices for successful transformations , and ( 3 ) identifies the most significant challenges dod faces in implementing nsps .
in recent years , we have examined various aspects of dod's human capital management of its civilian workforce .
these challenges include providing the sustained leadership essential to completing multiyear transformations , developing effective strategic workforce plans , creating effective hiring processes and using flexibilities and incentives to retain critical talent and reshape workforces , and reforming performance management systems so that pay and awards are linked to performance and organizational results .
implementing large - scale change management initiatives , such as organizational transformations , can be a complex endeavor .
for example , we have reported on gaps in the defense components' civilian human capital plans , including the absence of results - oriented performance measures and the need for comprehensive strategic workforce plans and for data on the skills and competencies needed to successfully accomplish future missions .
this report addresses dod's efforts to design its new civilian personnel management system .
significant changes in how the federal workforce is managed are under way , but strategic human capital management remains high risk because federal human capital strategies are still not appropriately constituted to meet current and emerging challenges .
to address challenges inherent in business transformation reforms , such as nsps , we recently recommended installing a chief management official at dod .
in addition , dod's new personnel management system will have far - reaching implications , not just for dod , but for civil service reform across the federal government .
our recently released report on the fiscal challenges the federal government faces in the 21st century identifies several issues regarding dod's civilian workforce that are ripe for reexamination , including whether dod is pursuing the design and implementation of nsps in a manner that maximizes the chance of success .
prior to the enactment of nsps legislation in november 2003 , we raised a number of critical issues about the proposed system in a series of testimonies before three congressional committees .
