my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) u.s. efforts to develop capable anp forces ; ( 2 ) challenges that affect the development of capable anp forces ; and ( 3 ) our analysis of u.s. efforts to develop a coordinated , detailed plan for completing and sustaining the ansf , including the anp .
u.s. support for the anp began in 2002 and increased significantly in 2005 in response to deteriorating security in afghanistan and concerns that anp development was proceeding too slowly .
u.s. activities currently include manning , training , and equipping of police forces as well as efforts to reform the afghan ministry of interior , which oversees the anp .
according to defense , an improved police force is vital to stabilizing and maintaining security throughout afghanistan .
my testimony is based on our concurrently issued report regarding u.s. efforts to develop the afghan national security forces ( ansf ) , which consist of the afghan national army ( ana ) and the anp .
state also expressed concerns about conditioning future appropriations on the completion of a detailed plan .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss u.s. efforts to assist in the development of afghan national police ( anp ) forces and the establishment of rule of law in afghanistan .
this plan should include , among other things , clearly defined objectives and performance measures , clearly defined roles and responsibilities , milestones for achieving these objectives , future funding requirements , and a strategy for sustaining the results achieved , including plans for transitioning responsibilities to afghanistan .
we believe a coordinated , detailed plan that outlines agency roles and responsibilities , lists clear milestones for achieving stated objectives , and includes a sustainment strategy may improve coordination and would enable assessment of progress and estimation of costs .
we continue to believe that a coordinated , detailed plan that outlines agency roles and responsibilities and includes clear milestones is essential to ensuring accountability of u.s. efforts and facilitating assessment of progress .
the united states has invested more than $6 billion since 2002 to develop the anp , but no police forces are assessed as fully capable of conducting their primary mission .
as such , interagency coordination , assessment of progress , and estimation of long - term costs are particularly important given that defense has begun a new initiative that is expected to last at least 4 to 5 years and military officials estimate that u.s. involvement in developing the anp could exceed a decade .
establishing capable afghan police is critical to improving security in afghanistan .
in response to our concurrently issued report , defense disagreed that congress should consider conditioning a portion of future appropriations on completion of a detailed plan to develop the ansf , stating that current guidance provided by state and defense to the field is sufficient to implement a successful program to train and equip the ansf .
over the course of our work , we reviewed and analyzed defense reporting and planning documents .
in 2008 , congress mandated that the president , acting through the secretary of defense , submit reports to congress on progress toward security and stability in afghanistan , including a comprehensive and long - term strategy and budget for strengthening the ansf .
