the risks and challenges the reviews identified included concerns over supply limitations for some isotopes , the need for long - term infrastructure investments to maintain the capacity for isotope production , and difficulties with accurately forecasting isotope demand .
since 2008 , the isotope program has been addressing programmatic risks and challenges as identified by external stakeholders as part of a series of program reviews .
in fiscal year 2011 , appropriations totaled almost $20 million , and revenues from sales of isotopes alone totaled almost $27 million , according to data provided by agency officials .
in fiscal year 2009 , doe transferred the isotope program from its office of nuclear energy to its office of science and revised the program's mission to three purposes: ( 1 ) produce or distribute isotopes in short supply , their associated by - products and surplus materials , and deliver isotope - related services ; ( 2 ) maintain the infrastructure required to produce and supply isotopes and related services ; and ( 3 ) investigate and develop new or improved isotope production and processing techniques that can make new isotopes available for research and other applications .
as demand for helium - 3 increased beginning in 2001 , sales quickly outpaced production levels , resulting in a critical shortage in 2008 .
as a result , the federal government was forced to quickly begin developing alternatives to helium - 3 in order to continue deploying radiation detection monitors .
through its office of nuclear materials integration , nnsa makes these isotopes available to other federal entities , including doe's isotope program , which then coordinates their sale and distribution to researchers and commercial entities .
these reports highlighted short - term and long - term risks and challenges facing the isotope program , such as the program's reliance on doe laboratories to produce certain isotopes .
in addition to doe's isotope program , nnsa generates or provides some additional isotopes as by - products of the weapons program and research activities .
at this workshop , more than 20 federal government entities , including the department of defense's defense threat reduction agency , department of homeland security's domestic nuclear detection office , national aeronautics and space administration , national institutes of health , and federal bureau of investigation identified more than 100 different isotopes that are key to achieving their missions , according to program officials .
doe is the only domestic supplier of helium - 3 , producing about 8,000 liters per year .
specifically , in august 2008 , doe organized a workshop bringing together a wide range of stakeholders to discuss the nation's current and future isotope needs and to consider options for improving the availability of needed isotopes .
the subcommittee produced two reports in response: one identifying and setting priorities for compelling research opportunities using isotopes and another report presenting opportunities and priorities for ensuring a robust national isotope program .
to meet this three - pronged mission , the isotope program operates from an annual budget consisting of yearly appropriations and revenues from isotope sales .
also in 2008 , doe requested that the nuclear science advisory committee form an isotope subcommittee to advise the program on specific isotope risks .
