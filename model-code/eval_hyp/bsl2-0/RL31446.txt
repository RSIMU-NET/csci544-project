laws may be passed toachieve policy or enforcement objectives and indirectly reorganize internal department and agencystructure in the process .
the landmark commissionapproach clearly emphasizes institutional issues and will concentrate on structural changes resultingfrom the commissions' recommendations and subsequent implementation .
it is recognized , however,that the term "reorganization" covers much more than structural changes .
this broad definition of the term reorganization , however , will be largely avoided to facilitateattention to the successive landmark commissions as guideposts through this century ofadministrative management .
this was certainly the case when congress passed the inspectors generalact of 1978 , an act that altered the internal structure of agencies and the behavior of agency officials .
successive commission reports and recommendations provideevidence of the recurring nature of these and other related value issues .
in its effort to develop such statements ofgenerality this report will study the work and results of a number of commissions and other similarbodies that have had executive organization and reorganization as part of their mandate .
senator fred thompson , then chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee,introduced the "government for the 21st century act" ( s. 2306 ) .
viewing landmark commissions sequentially and exploring the philosophical norms andvalues guiding their work is only one of several possible approaches to the extensive subject ofexecutive branch organization in the recently completed century .
shouldcommission recommendations seek to give a greater or lesser role for government in the social andeconomic life of the nation ? .
the legislation , whichdid not receive congressional action , sought to establish a nine - member commission on governmentrestructuring and reform appointed jointly by the president and congressional leadership .
in nearly every congress , legislation is introduced to establish a commission with a broadmandate .
the commission was tosubmit its recommendations on restructuring by december 1 , 2002 .
should commission recommendations serve to encourage administrativeintegration and centralization or the values of agency particularity and decentralization ? .
forpurposes of this report , these reorganization exercises are referred to collectively as "landmarkcommissions. .
or , is there a continuing need for periodic reviews andrealignments of the basic organizational structure of government ? .
context for discussion of landmark commissions in the 20th century is provided by a reviewand analysis of six crucial periods in the evolution of the organization of the executive branch ofgovernment: the founders and the political theory that informed their organizationaldecisions in 1789 ; the interplay of the president and congress in executive organizationalmanagement during the 19th century ; the progressive movement of the 20th century's first decades and its continuinglegacy ; the rise and decline of "orthodoxy" in organizational management of theexecutive branch ; the interregnum period ( 1972-1992 ) with its doctrinal heterodoxy ; and the emergence of a new public management paradigm and itscritics .
the 106th congress , the last congress of the 20st century , proved to be no exception in thisrespect .
this very richness of subject matter , however , calls for somegeneralizations to help explain the events and trends that occupied the attention of successivecongresses , scholars , and generations of practitioners .
 ( 1 ) in tracing the history of thesecommissions , the interplay of conflicting values appear with regularity .
