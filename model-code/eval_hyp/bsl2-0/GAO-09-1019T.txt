as the department of defense ( dod ) has expanded its involvement in overseas military operations , it has grown increasingly reliant on its federal civilian workforce to provide support .
lack of such information may hamper these agencies' ability to intervene quickly to address any future health issues that may result from deployments in support of contingency operations .
congress has also enacted laws that allow agency heads to waive premium pay caps for deployed civilians .
according to dod and state estimates , the federal government has deployed , since 2001 , over 10,000 civilians in support of the stabilization and reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan .
dod acknowledged its growing reliance on civilian personnel in its 2006 quadrennial defense review , and since fiscal year 2004 the department has converted thousands of military positions to civilian positions and is planning to convert more .
we therefore recommended that ( 1 ) dod establish mechanisms to ensure that its policies to identify and track deployed civilians are implemented and ( 2 ) the five other executive agencies included in our review develop policies and procedures to accurately identify and track standardized information on deployed civilians .
as we previously reported , dod's use of civilian personnel to support military operations has long raised questions about its policies on compensation and medical benefits for such civilians .
as a result , congress has enacted a number of laws aimed at leveling compensation for deployed civilians across agencies and pay systems .
the department of state ( state ) and other federal agencies also play an important role in the stabilization and reconstruction of at - risk countries and regions , consistent with a collaborative , “whole of government” approach .
for example , in 2006 dod did not have quality assurance procedures in place to ensure that deployed civilians completed ( 1 ) pre - deployment health assessments to make certain they were medically fit to deploy and ( 2 ) post - deployment health assessments to document their health status following deployment , environmental exposures , and health concerns related to their work while deployed .
the civilian workforce performs , among other things , combat support functions that traditionally have been performed by the uniformed military , such as logistics support and maintenance .
in 2008 and 2009 , dod reiterated its policy requirements and again called for dod components to comply .
these efforts include maintaining sufficient data to enable agencies to inform deployed civilians about any emerging health issues that might affect them .
moreover , ongoing efforts within dod and state to establish a cadre of deployable civilians further emphasizes that the federal government realizes the important role these federal civilians play in supporting ongoing and future contingency operations and stabilization and reconstruction efforts throughout the world .
this civilian workforce consists of employees who are compensated under several different pay systems in use at the time of our review , including the general schedule ( gs ) , foreign service ( fs ) , and the recently implemented national security personnel system ( nsps ) for dod civilian employees .
monetary compensation includes payments such as salary and danger pay and nonmonetary compensation includes benefits such as leave and retirement contributions .
