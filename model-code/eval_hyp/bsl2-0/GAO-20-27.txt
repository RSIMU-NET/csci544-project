as appropriate , we assessed fcc's efforts implementing the reforms against federal internal - control standards and fcc's strategic plan .
to evaluate the extent to which fcc has implemented reforms intended to improve the accountability of rate - of - return carriers' funding , we reviewed fcc orders and policies , prior gao and fcc oig reports , and other relevant documents related to high - cost support reforms .
fcc has adopted reforms in recent years intended to improve the accountability of rate - of - return carriers' funding .
we reviewed four fcc orders that fcc confirmed contained the significant rate - of - return reforms related to funding accountability and compliance .
this report examines the extent to which fcc has implemented reforms intended to improve the accountability of rate - of - return carriers' funding , and is managing fraud risks for the usf high - cost program in accordance with leading practices .
we categorized the reforms based on their purpose and determined whether the reforms had been implemented .
these cases came to fcc's attention only after the carriers had already been improperly receiving high - cost support for years , and fcc's oig staff said that skilled bad actors may remain undetected .
to help ensure that consumers in rural , insular , and high - cost areas have access to modern communications networks capable of providing broadband service , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has a program that provides approximately $4.5 billion annually to eligible telecommunications carriers that offer services in these areas .
you asked us to review fcc's oversight of rate - of - return carriers participating in the high - cost program .
those expenses included family travel , gifts , donations , tuition reimbursement , and special events ; costs that were not necessary for maintaining and extending telecommunications services .
there have been cases involving rate - of - return carriers receiving millions of dollars in improper payments from the high - cost program .
the framework contains four components: ( 1 ) commit , ( 2 ) assess , ( 3 ) design and implement , and ( 4 ) evaluate and adapt .
in addition , we interviewed fcc officials responsible for setting overall policy and the regulations that govern the usf program .
 ( recommendation 5 ) .
additionally , in august 2018 , fcc's office of inspector general ( oig ) reported that a rate - of - return carrier had reported approximately $80,000 in ineligible expenses from 2012 to 2015 for reimbursement , even though according to fcc , the expenses were defined as unnecessary and , thus , prohibited .
for example , from 2002 to 2015 , one such carrier received reimbursement for deploying infrastructure to areas where no consumers existed and , at the same time , received at least $27 million in reimbursement f or ineligible costs , including a $1.3 million personal residence and a $43,000 sport utility vehicle .
this program is referred to as the universal service fund ( usf ) high - cost program , and the program funding that the carriers receive is referred to as “support.” one type of carrier that receives support for providing broadband in high - cost areas is a “rate - of - return carrier” — small , rural carriers that serve 5 percent or less of u.s. households .
