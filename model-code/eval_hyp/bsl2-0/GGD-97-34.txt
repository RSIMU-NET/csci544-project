accordingly , this report discusses ( 1 ) the potential universe of taxpayers that may be eligible for innocent spouse relief , ( 2 ) the internal revenue service's ( irs ) practices and procedures for handling requests for innocent spouse relief , ( 3 ) whether the innocent spouse provisions provide the same treatment for all taxpayers , ( 4 ) the potential effects of replacing the joint and several liability standard with a proportionate liability standard , ( 5 ) the potential effects on irs of requiring it to abide by the terms of divorce decrees when those decrees allocate tax liabilities , and ( 6 ) the potential effects on irs of changing the law so that community income of one spouse cannot be seized to satisfy tax liabilities incurred by the other spouse before their marriage .
because of concerns about the effectiveness of the current innocent spouse provisions and other perceived inequities caused by the joint and several liability standard , section 401 of the taxpayer bill of rights 2 directed us to study and report on several issues related to the joint and several liability standard that applies to jointly filed federal income tax returns .
however , when one spouse , independently and without the knowledge of the other spouse , incurs the additional taxes , the other potentially “innocent spouse” may obtain relief from the additional tax liability if certain conditions are met .
because of this joint and several liability standard , one spouse can be held liable for tax deficiencies assessed after a joint return was filed that were solely attributable to the actions of the other spouse .
when a married couple files a joint federal income tax return , each spouse becomes individually responsible for paying the entire amount of the tax associated with that return .
in 1971 , congress enacted the innocent spouse provisions in the internal revenue code ( section 6013 ( e ) ) to recognize the inequity of holding spouses liable for additional tax assessments in certain cases .
more taxpayers might qualify for relief if congress eliminated or modified the dollar thresholds to allow irs to consider relief for taxpayers with liabilities less than $500 .
some couples would also probably have been assessed additional taxes as a result of overstated deductions , credits , or basis , which have other dollar thresholds in addition to the $500 threshold .
replacing the joint and several liability standard with a proportionate liability standard may also provide additional relief to taxpayers , but this alternative could create a significant administrative burden for taxpayers and irs .
for married couples with substantially disproportionate incomes , such income - splitting may lower their overall taxes because some of the higher earner's income could fall into a lower tax bracket and be taxed at a lower rate than if it had all been taxed as the income of one person .
from irs' data on tax year 1992 audit and underreporter programs , we estimated that 1.25 million couples filing joint returns were assessed additional taxes under these programs — 250,000 were audit assessments and 1 million were underreporter assessments .
congress subsequently determined that in some instances , it was inequitable to hold taxpayers liable for additional taxes resulting from their spouses' unreported income .
