to assist congress as it continues to debate tax reform options , this report provides a review of recent legislative proposals introduced since the 113 th congress .
what are the objectives regarding federal deficits and the debt ? .
recent tax reform proposals seek to lower tax rates , broaden the tax base , and provide a simpler and fairer tax system overall .
which tax provisions should be modified or eliminated ? .
tax reform has been a subject of debate in the past several congress and many policymakers agree that the u.s. tax system is in need of reform .
if comprehensive tax reform is not deemed feasible , congress could choose to consider reforms to certain parts of the code as an alternative .
the difficulty with tax reform , however , is agreeing on the crucial details needed to refresh the tax system .
policymakers often speak of the goal to achieve comprehensive reform of the entire tax code .
should the reformed tax system be income - based or consumption - based ? .
how far should rates be lowered ? .
similarly , congress could choose to reform only portions of the corporate system , such as just the international aspects of the corporate system .
for example , the corporate tax system could be reformed first and the individual tax system , and perhaps payroll tax system , at a later date .
tradeoffs may exist between these three objectives .
before reviewing recent reform proposals , it may be helpful to review the three criteria by which economists often evaluate tax policy — equity , efficiency , and simplicity .
alternatively , congress could choose to evaluate business - only options , which would involve changes to the corporate system and portions of the individual system under which "pass - through" business income generated by sole proprietors , partnerships , limited liability companies , and s corporations is taxed .
s implicity considers the amount of resources that must be committed to administering , enforcing , and complying with the tax system .
horizontal equity holds that taxpayers with similar incomes should face similar tax burdens .
low marginal tax rates applied to a broad tax base , with few exclusions or exemptions , tend be more economically efficient .
equity concerns the fairness of a particular tax system .
the 114 th congress did not enact comprehensive tax reform or legislation to replace the income tax system .
several major tax reform proposals were put forward by members in the 113 th congress , but not enacted .
economists rely on two concepts of equity — horizontal equity and vertical equity .
the proposal also would reduce taxes on active pass - through business income , dividends , and capital gains ; increase the standard deduction ; repeal the affordable care act ( aca ) - related tax provisions ; and repeal the alternative minimum tax ( amt ) .
efficiency relates to the degree to which the tax system distorts economic decision making .
tax reform continues to be actively debated in the 115 th congress .
vertical equity examines the distribution of tax burdens across different income groups .
under an ability - to - pay standard , vertical equity suggests that taxpayers in higher income groups should pay more .
