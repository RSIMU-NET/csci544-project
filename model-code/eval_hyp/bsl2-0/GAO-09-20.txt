more recent flooding in the midwest and from the 2008 hurricane season are likely to reignite persistent questions about the program's long - term financial solvency and the impact of subsidized premiums on its long - term financial health .
to address these questions , as agreed with your staff , this study ( 1 ) provides information on nfip's inventory of subsidized properties and their financial impact on the program and ( 2 ) examines nfip's current approach to managing its inventory of subsidized properties and the advantages and disadvantages of options for reducing or eliminating the financial impact of properties insured at subsidized rates .
to address these objectives , we analyzed nfip data on flood insurance policies , including both subsidized and full - risk premiums and claims .
in march 2006 , we designated nfip as high - risk , in part because of the program's financial condition and inability to repay funds borrowed from the u.s. treasury to cover the catastrophic flood losses resulting from the 2005 hurricanes .
but critics of the subsidies have argued that subsidized rates should be discontinued for several reasons .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , which is the department of homeland security agency that administers nfip , estimates that properties covered by policies with subsidized rates experience as much as five times more flood damage than compliant new structures experience that are charged rates that aim to reflect the actual risk of flooding ( full - risk rates ) .
critics argue , for example , that some of the individuals receiving subsidies may be able to afford full - risk premiums and that the availability of subsidized rates may actually create a disincentive for property owners to mitigate their properties to reduce the risk of flood damage .
specifically , the act authorizes subsidized rates for many existing properties in high - risk locations known as special flood hazard areas ( sfha ) that otherwise would have been charged higher premiums , with the justification that these properties were built before flood insurance rate maps ( firm ) became available and the level of risk was clearly understood .
the national flood insurance act of 1968 authorized subsidized rates to encourage participation in nfip .
largely as a result of claims associated with the 2005 hurricane season , the program's outstanding debt stands at $17.4 billion as of june 2008 .
therefore , implementing any or a combination of these options could significantly reduce the adverse financial impact of subsidies on nfip .
the honorable richard c. shelby ranking member committee on banking , housing , and urban affairs united states senate in 2007 , about 1.2 million — or almost one out of four — residential flood insurance policies covered by the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) continued to be sold at highly discounted rates that did not fully reflect the actual risk of flood damage ( known as subsidized rates ) .
we also analyzed nfip's legislative history and examined fema's implementation of legislative requirements authorizing subsidized rates for certain properties in high risk locations .
given that subsidized rates average 35 to 40 percent of what full - risk rates would be on the same properties , these policies represent a financial drain on the program .
