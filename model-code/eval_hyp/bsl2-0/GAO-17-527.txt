this report assesses the extent to which ( 1 ) enlistees have been unable to complete their initial terms of commitment due to medical reasons for fiscal years 2005 through 2015 ; ( 2 ) usmepcom obtains , analyzes , and uses information about enlistee early attrition due to medical reasons ; and ( 3 ) dod has implemented its new electronic health record system at the meps to obtain and document applicants' medical information .
from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2015 , the military services enlisted over 1.7 million servicemembers at an estimated cost of approximately $75,000 per enlistee , according to the department of defense ( dod ) .
in january 1997 , we reported that dod could save millions of dollars by employing better screening procedures of enlistees .
to further address several of the recommendations we made in our 1997 report , congress enacted changes in november 1997 to title 10 , the law governing the armed forces , aimed at improving recruit quality and reducing recruit attrition .
specifically , we reported that dod did not have consistent and complete data to allow it to assess attrition trends and the factors behind changes in the trends .
house report 114-537 , which accompanied a proposed bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 , included a provision for us to conduct a review of applicant medical screening issues at the meps .
in the1997 report , we made seven recommendations to dod to help reduce the attrition of enlistees during the first 180 days of their initial terms of commitment .
of these seven recommendations , dod concurred with and implemented changes that addressed all but one â€” moving the review of the medical early separation records away from the u.s. military entrance processing command ( usmepcom ) , which still requests and analyzes those records .
its mission is to evaluate applicants by applying established dod standards during applicant processing for the military service at 65 military entrance processing station ( meps ) locations across the united states .
when early separation occurs , the military services lose their investment in the enlistees and must recruit additional applicants to replace them .
additionally , we reported that applicants often conceal their medical histories and that the military services were waiving medical conditions that , according to dod directives , were disqualifying .
fiscal year 2015 is the most recent year for which an entire year's worth of attrition data are available and , for relevancy purposes , we obtained data not more than 10 years old , beginning in fiscal year 2005 .
however , incomplete medical information or inadequate medical screening of these enlistees may result in them not fulfilling their initial terms of commitment , which often ranges from 4 and 6 years of active duty .
usmepcom operates under the direction of the deputy assistant secretary of defense for military personnel policy - accession policy within the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness .
for the first objective , we analyzed data from the defense manpower data center ( dmdc ) on accessions and the early attrition of active - duty enlistees from the four military services during their first terms of commitment , often between four and six years of active duty service , for fiscal years 2005 through 2015 .
