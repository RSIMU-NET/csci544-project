despite this annual influx of billions of federal dollars to the farm sector , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) reports that the number of farms has been declining about 1 percent per year .
payments to farmers under federal farm programs have reached an historic high — over $20 billion in fiscal year 2000 .
nearly one - half of u.s. farms are receiving payments for income or price support purposes and / or for engaging in activities such as land conservation .
these payments , in total , made up almost one - half of net farm income in fiscal year 2000 .
although the payments averaged about $17,000 for the farms receiving them in 1999 , the level of assistance can range from a few dollars up to tens of thousands of dollars .
this decline , which has occurred partly as a result of consolidation , is most pronounced among small family farms .
concerned that farm payments are not being effectively targeted to aid the survival of small farms and the entry of young people into agriculture , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the distribution of farm payments over the past decade by farm size , operators' age , state , and crop and ( 2 ) identify the major barriers that make it difficult for young people to enter farming .
for example , the share of farmers under age 35 decreased from 15 percent in 1954 to 8 percent in 1997 , while the share of farmers age 55 or older increased from 37 percent to 61 percent .
according to the census of agriculture , which is conducted every 5 years , the nation had about 1.9 million farms in 1997 , down from 2.1 million farms in 1987 .
these surveys — called the agricultural resource management study — include information on crop and livestock production practices and the financial and operating characteristics of farms .
the information on payments by crop and state is from usda's program payments reporting system , a national database of payments made under the department's farm programs .
 ( see app .
moreover , the average age of farm operators continues to increase .
the following information on the distribution of farm payments by farm size and operators' age is from our analysis of usda's annual surveys of u.s. farm operations .

the most recent farm bill — the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 ( the 1996 farm bill ) — substantially revised some farm payment provisions while retaining others .
other farm states have established similar programs .
because farm payments have generally been based on the production of major crops or commodities , larger farming operations generally have received larger payments than smaller ones .
smaller farms have consistently received smaller payments than have larger ones , and this gap has widened .
moreover , usda maintains that the nonagricultural economy in rural communities has grown steadily and agriculture's' relative importance as a source for jobs and income in rural communities is declining .
despite these policies and programs , usda anticipates that the imbalance between retiring and beginning farmers may continue over the next decade .
