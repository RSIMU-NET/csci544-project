examples of interrelationships between water and energysource: u.s. department of energy , energy demands on water resources , report to congress on the interdependency of energy and water , december 2006 , p. 13 .
there is growing recognition that "saving energy saves water," and the report describes options and impediments for energy efficiency by these facilities .
it also identifies several areas of research and information needs concerning energy for water uses .
meeting energy needs depends upon the availability of water , often in large quantities , for mineral extraction and mining , fuel production , hydropower , and thermoelectric power plant cooling .
this report first discusses water - related energy use broadly and then energy for facilities that treat and deliver water to end users and also dispose of and discharge wastewater .
likewise , energy is required for the pumping , conveyance , treatment and conditioning , and distribution of water and for collection , treatment , and discharge of wastewater .
w ater and energy are critical resources that are reciprocally and mutually linked .
figure 1 .
this interdependence , which is often described as the water - energy nexus , or energy - water nexus , is illustrated in the following graphic from a u.s. department of energy report .
analysis is needed of incentives , disincentives , and lack of incentives to investing in cost - effective energy or water efficiency measures .
epri's analysis covered public water supply agencies and publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities ( accounting for 1.6% of u.s. electricity consumption in 2000 ) and self - generated private water and wastewater treatment ( i.e. , for industry and mining , agriculture , and commercial supply and treatment , accounting for 2.1% of u.s. electricity consumption in 2000 ) .
energy efficiency initiatives offer opportunities for delivering significant water savings , and likewise , water efficiency initiatives offer opportunities for delivering significant energy savings .
epri projected that electricity consumption by these sectors would increase by 23% in 2020 from 2000 levels and by 63% in 2050 .
policies and approaches are needed to encourage the water and energy sectors to move toward integrated resource management .
interest has been growing in better understanding of the energy - related needs of providing water to diverse sectors of the economy .
in the united states , more than 400 billion gallons of water are withdrawn daily from surface and ground water sources of freshwater and saline - water to supply domestic uses , agriculture including irrigation , industry , mining , and thermoelectric power .
in particular , as described further below , energy needs for self - supplied domestic , industrial , and energy water are largely unknown , but are likely to be large .
this is apparent across sectors and also within individual sectors .
several areas of research and information needs concerning energy for water uses have been identified by a range of researchers and stakeholders .
better understanding is needed of linkages between energy , water , land , and agriculture and risks of climate change and extreme weather events on water availability and energy supply .
one area of interest is regulatory barriers to co - implementation of efficiency programs in the water and energy sectors .
