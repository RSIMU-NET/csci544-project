tradoc's lessons learned program has two primary weaknesses that hamper its effectiveness .
as requested , we determined whether the army has an effective program for using these lessons learned to correct the problems identified at the training centers .
however , as discussed below , we believe an effective assessment in such critical areas — as well as whether more can or should be done to modify training and doctrine — requires a more disciplined process .
these officials may be correct in their view that recurring problems are less severe , as indicated in fratricide data .
the army assesses the performance of units during their rotations at the combat training centers , identifies the lessons learned from their battlefield experience , and disseminates this information so that training and doctrine can be modified to avoid repeating the same mistakes during training exercises .
in spite of the plan , these problems were not completely resolved .
we believe that effective implementation of these initiatives should significantly improve the lessons learned program .
these problems are in such areas as battlefield planning ; development and use of intelligence data , reconnaissance , and communications ; performance under chemical threats ; and integration of effective fire support into unit mission planning .
furthermore , officials said that some deficiencies will never be eliminated entirely because ( 1 ) the army is continuously training new soldiers and it is reasonable to expect them to make mistakes as they learn their profession and ( 2 ) some tasks are particularly complex and difficult to master .
the combined arms command , believing that these problems increased the risk that units could not conduct successful defensive operations , issued a corrective action plan in 1988 .
we believe that another contributing factor may have been the combined arms command's failure to adequately monitor the plan's implementation .
according to combined arms command officials , the lack of progress in resolving these deficiencies was caused by the tasks' complexity and competing demands that limited training at home stations .
other examples of recurring deficiencies involve battlefield supply procedures and the construction of fortifications .
we found that the army has more aggressively implemented the 1990 plan , and recent data shows improvements in fratricide - related problems since that time .
the schools thus choose the problems they will address , with no direction from tradoc leadership on which ones merit greatest attention .
second , tradoc lacks formal follow - up procedures for tracking the use of lessons learned and holding the schools accountable for correcting deficiencies .
the combined arms command reported in 1988 that combat units at the combat training centers were bogged down waiting for engineering construction support materials to reach them and had weaknesses in their basic fortification skills .
tradoc officials told us that even though the center for army lessons learned had continued to identify recurring deficiencies in exercises conducted at the training centers , the deficiencies were not as severe as they were in the past .
army officials raised concerns about the possibility of fratricide , and the combined arms command issued a new plan in december 1990 for correcting fratricide - related deficiencies in unit training .
more specifically , it said that the guidance would direct tradoc to establish ( 1 ) a system to assign priorities to the problems identified at the combat training centers and ( 2 ) procedures for tracking lessons learned and assigning accountability for problem resolution .
