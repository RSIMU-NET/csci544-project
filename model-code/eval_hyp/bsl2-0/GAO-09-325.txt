specifically , we assessed progress in ( 1 ) acquiring gps satellites , ( 2 ) acquiring the ground control and user equipment necessary to leverage gps satellite capabilities , and ( 3 ) coordinating among federal agencies and other organizations to ensure broader gps missions can be accomplished .
in light of the global economic and national security importance of gps , the ongoing gps modernization effort , and the international efforts to develop new systems , you asked us to undertake a broad review of the program and efforts to replenish and upgrade capability .
dod also provides most of the funding for gps .
the modernization effort includes gps iif and iiia , two satellite acquisition programs currently underway that are to provide new space - based capabilities and replenish the satellite constellation ; the ground control segment hardware and software ; and user equipment for processing modernized gps capabilities .
the u.s. government , which plans to invest more than $5.8 billion from 2009 through 2013 in the gps space and ground control segments currently under development , provides gps service free of charge .
the department of defense ( dod ) develops and operates gps , and an interdepartmental committee — co - chaired by dod and the department of transportation — manages the u.s. space - based positioning , navigation , and timing infrastructure , which includes gps .
to assess the acquisition of satellite , ground control , and user equipment , we interviewed office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) and dod officials from offices that manage and oversee the gps program .
the air force , which is responsible for gps acquisition , is in the process of modernizing gps to enhance its performance , accuracy , and integrity .
we also reviewed and analyzed program plans and documentation related to cost , schedule , requirements , program direction , and satellite constellation sustainment , and compared programmatic data to gao's criteria compiled over the last 12 years for best practices in system development .
other countries are now developing their own independent global navigation satellite systems that could offer capabilities that are comparable , if not superior to gps .
the global positioning system ( gps ) — a space - based satellite system that provides positioning , navigation , and timing data to users worldwide — has become essential to u.s. national security and a key component in economic growth , transportation safety , homeland security , and critical national infrastructure in the united states and abroad .
gps is integrated into nearly every facet of u.s. military operations , and the number of civil users is increasing .
dod has restructured several programs in the face of delays and cost growth .
to assess coordination among federal agencies and the broader gps community , we interviewed osd and dod officials from offices that manage and oversee the gps program , officials from the military services , officials from the department of transportation and other civil departments and agencies , and officials at the u.s. department of state and at various european space organizations .
we also analyzed how civil departments and agencies coordinate with dod on gps civil requirements , and how the u.s. government coordinates with foreign countries .
