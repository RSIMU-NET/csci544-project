under the medicare and medicaid programs , nursing homes were expected to receive $58 billion in 2001 , with a federal share of approximately $38 billion .
such resident assessment data are known as the minimum data set ( mds ) .
nursing homes that participate in these programs are required to periodically assess the care needs of residents in order to develop an appropriate plan of care .
the federal government contracts with states to periodically inspect or survey nursing homes , and state surveyors use mds data to help assess the quality of resident care.medicare and some state medicaid programs also use mds data to adjust nursing home payments to account for variation in resident care needs .
concerns exist , however , that state surveyors already have too many tasks and that , as a result , the survey process may not adequately address mds accuracy .
in response to your request , we assessed ( 1 ) how states monitor the accuracy of mds data compiled by nursing homes through review programs separate from their standard nursing home survey process , ( 2 ) how states attempt to improve the data's accuracy where there are indications of problems , and ( 3 ) how the federal government ensures the accuracy of mds data .
we also interviewed staff from the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that manages the medicare and medicaid programs , who were responsible for developing the agency's mds review program .
such facilities provide skilled nursing , therapy , or supportive care to older individuals who do not need the intensive medical care provided by hospitals , but for whom receiving care at home is not feasible .
thus , the accuracy of mds data has implications for the identification of quality problems and the level of nursing home payments .
federal guidance for state surveyors regarding the accuracy of mds assessments focuses on whether appropriate personnel completed or coordinated the assessments and whether there are any indications that the assessments were falsified .
in addition , our prior work on nursing home quality issues has identified weaknesses in the survey process that raise questions about the thoroughness and consistency of state surveys .
mds accuracy is one of many areas that state surveyors are expected to examine during periodic nursing home surveys .
nursing homes play an important role in the health care system of the united states .
more than 40 percent of elderly americans will use a nursing home at some time in their lives .
we surveyed the 50 states and the district of columbia to determine whether states had a separate mds review program â€” distinct from any mds oversight that might occur during the periodic nursing home surveys performed by all states .
the remaining 33 states have no plans to implement separate mds review programs and currently rely on their periodic nursing home surveys for mds oversight .
this guidance also instructs surveyors to conduct a check of specific mds items to ensure that the resident's condition is appropriately characterized .
all 18 of these states either currently use an mds - based medicaid payment system or plan to implement such a system .
