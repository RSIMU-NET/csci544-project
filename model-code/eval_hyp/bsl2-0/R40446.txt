irca coupled legalization programs for certain segments of the unauthorized population with provisions to deter future unauthorized immigration by reducing the magnet of employment .
the irca provisions did not have the effect of curtailing future illegal immigration .
many years of debate about unauthorized immigration to the united states culminated in the enactment of the immigration reform and control act ( irca ) of 1986 .
ten years after the enactment of irca , congress attempted to strengthen the employment verification process as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) .
after falling to an estimated 1.9 million in 1988 as eligible unauthorized aliens legalized their status , the unauthorized population began to grow .
to reduce the job magnet , irca amended the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) to add a new section 274a , which makes it unlawful to knowingly hire , recruit , or refer for a fee , or continue to employ , an unauthorized alien , and requires all employers to examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work authorization and to complete and retain employment eligibility verification ( i - 9 ) forms .
that year , there were an estimated 3.2 million unauthorized aliens in the country .
by the early 1990s , it had surpassed pre - irca levels .
these latter provisions reflected a belief , widely held then and now , that most unauthorized aliens enter and remain in the united states in order to work .
the former immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) within the u.s. department of justice had initial responsibility for administering the employment eligibility confirmation pilot programs .
citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) .
the i - 9 process was effectively undermined by the ready availability of genuine - looking fraudulent documents .
iirira directed the attorney general to conduct three largely voluntary pilot programs for electronic employment eligibility confirmation .
in weighing proposals that may emerge on electronic employment eligibility verification , policymakers may want to consider potential impacts on the key issues of unauthorized employment ; verification system accuracy , efficiency , and capacity ; discrimination ; employer compliance ; privacy ; and verification system usability and employer burden .
in 2003 , dhs assumed this responsibility .
iirira tasked the attorney general with establishing a confirmation system to respond to inquiries made by participants in these pilot programs "at any time through a toll - free telephone line or other toll - free electronic media concerning an individual's identity and whether the individual is authorized to be employed. .
after examining documents and completing i - 9 forms as required under ina section 274a , employers participating in a pilot program would seek to confirm the identity and employment eligibility of their new hires .
the policy issues discussed here may be especially important to consider in the context of proposals to require all employers to conduct electronic employment eligibility verification .
a mandatory system could arguably make it possible to identify many more unauthorized workers .
employer compliance under a mandatory system would seem to be a salient issue , especially since it has direct implications for other issues , notably discrimination .
at the same time , under such a system , any inaccuracies , inefficiencies , or privacy breaches that occurred could affect much larger numbers of employees and employers .
