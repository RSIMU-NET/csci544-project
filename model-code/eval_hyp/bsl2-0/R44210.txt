this report analyzes the appellate body decisions in two disputes: u.s. – certain country of origin labeling requirements ( u.s. – cool ) and u.s. – measures concerning the importation , marketing and sale of tuna and tuna products ( u.s. – tuna ii ) .
cool program , as currently implemented , impairs trade by approximately $3 billion per year .
to date , relatively few wto disputes have been raised challenging member compliance with the tbt agreement's provisions .
in 2008 , canada and mexico , through wto dispute settlement procedures , requested consultations with the united states regarding u.s. country of origin labeling ( cool ) requirements for certain beef and pork products .
however , in recent years , the united states has faced claims alleging its failure to abide by the terms of the tbt agreement .
in two of these cases , which are still ongoing , the wto found that certain u.s. labeling requirements for food products violated the tbt agreement's nondiscrimination obligations — that is , the measures at issue treated foreign products less favorably than domestic products .
the appellate body reports from these two disputes provide insight into how the wto applies these nondiscrimination provisions , and can provide guidance for congress to consider when enacting future programs that regulate product characteristics .
the wto dispute settlement understanding ( dsu ) allows wto members to retaliate against an offending party by raising tariffs or suspending other concessions made under wto agreements in an amount equal to the impairment of trade caused by the offending measure .
the world trade organization's ( wto ) agreement on technical barriers to trade ( tbt agreement ) establishes obligations that wto members must adhere to when they impose requirements on a product's characteristics .
in the wto dispute u.s. – cool , canada and mexico claimed that the labeling program , inter alia , violated u.s. obligations under the tbt agreement , arguing that the cool program impermissibly treated foreign livestock less favorably than domestic livestock .
after the wto reached its final decision on the merits in may 2015 , canada and mexico requested permission from the wto to retaliate against the united states through the suspension of concessions .
in their request for retaliation , canada and mexico have claimed that the u.s .
in another recent wto case involving the united states , u.s. – tuna ii , mexico claimed that the united states' "dolphin - safe" labeling program for tuna products , established by the dolphin protection consumer information act ( dpcia ) , also violated the tbt agreement .
after the parties exhausted the available dispute settlement procedures , including appeals , the wto appellate body ruled in favor of canada and mexico , finding that the cool program impermissibly discriminated against the foreign livestock .
in that case , mexico argued that the dolphin - safe label program impermissibly treated tuna from mexico less favorably than domestic tuna and tuna from other foreign nations .
the united states has challenged the amounts that canada and mexico have claimed — that appeal is currently being heard by arbitrators at the wto , with a decision on the amount of impairment due in the coming months .
