these revenue shortfalls reflect both the devastating effects of catastrophic hurricanes and structural weaknesses in the way the program is funded .
we have also previously identified management issues , particularly with respect to fema's oversight of write - your - own ( wyo ) insurers .
my testimony today will revisit and update the challenges we identified in previous reports , specifically ( 1 ) nfip's financial challenges , ( 2 ) fema's operational and management challenges relating to nfip , and ( 3 ) actions needed to address these challenges .
our previous reports identified many of these weaknesses , including subsidized premium rates , rate - setting methods that do not reflect the actual risk of losses due to flooding , and claims arising from a small number of repetitive loss properties .
we are currently conducting a comprehensive review of nfip management and other ongoing challenges that fema faces in administering the program .
gao placed nfip on its high - risk list in march 2006 , not only because of the program's potential to incur billions of dollars in losses and the many financial challenges it faces , but also because of operational and management challenges within fema , many of which we have identified in previous reports to congress .
as of april 2010 , nfip owed approximately $18.8 billion to the u.s. treasury , primarily as a result of loans the program received to pay claims from the 2005 hurricane season .
nfip borrowed additional funds from treasury to make interest payments on this debt and is unlikely ever to be able to repay the entire amount .
as you know , nfip is a key component of the federal government's efforts to minimize the damage and financial impact of floods and is the only source of insurance against flood damage for most residents in flood - prone areas .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) and the challenges that the federal emergency management administration ( fema ) faces in administering it .
my statement is based largely on completed work on the oversight of the wyo program , the financial impact of subsidized premium rates , and the rate - setting process for flood insurance premiums .
in addition , addressing nfip's current challenges will require the cooperation and participation of many stakeholders .
in addressing these financial challenges , fema will also need to address a number of operational and management challenges before nfip can be eligible for removal from the list .
our previous work has identified many of the necessary actions that fema should take , and preliminary observations from our ongoing work have revealed additional operational and management issues .
as we noted when placing nfip on the high - risk list in 2006 , comprehensive reform will likely be needed to address the financial challenges facing the program .
by addressing both the financial challenges as well as the operational and management issues , nfip will be in a much stronger position to achieve its goals and ultimately to reduce its burden on the taxpayer .
we performed our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
while these are all encouraging developments , fema is still unlikely to ever pay off its current $18.8 billion debt .
