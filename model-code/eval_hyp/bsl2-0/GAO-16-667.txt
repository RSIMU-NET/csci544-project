the department of justice ( justice ) reported that , in fiscal year 2015 , federal agencies received 713,168 foia requests .
the department further reported that 483 foia - related lawsuits were filed against federal agencies during calendar year 2015 .
our specific objective was to determine the foia litigation - related costs incurred by federal agencies for lawsuits in which the plaintiff substantially prevailed .
nevertheless , even as agencies respond to hundreds of thousands of foia requests each year , many requests ( or portions thereof ) may be denied or not responded to in a timely manner .
in addition , the act states that the court may assess against the government reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs incurred in a foia lawsuit if the requester has obtained relief through either a judicial order , or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree ; or a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency , if the plaintiff's claim is not insubstantial .
the freedom of information act ( foia ) requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to government information on the basis of the principles of openness and accountability in government .
accordingly , federal agencies release information to requesters that contribute to the understanding of government actions , including the disclosure of waste , fraud , and abuse .
to address the objective , we obtained and reviewed justice's litigation and compliance reports , covering the time period from january 2009 through december 2014 , to identify foia lawsuits where decisions were rendered .
this report responds to your request that we conduct an audit of the amount of money spent by the federal government as a result of foia lawsuits .
for this reason , the act allows requesters to challenge an agency's final decision in federal court through a lawsuit if the agency does not respond to a request for information within the statutory time frames or if the requesters believe they are entitled to information that is being withheld by the agency .
to provide greater transparency in the reporting of foia litigation costs , congress could consider requiring justice to provide a cost estimate for collecting and reporting information on costs incurred when defending lawsuits in which the plaintiffs prevailed .
further , congress could consider amending the act to require justice to reflect in its litigation and compliance reports , changes in the award of attorneys' fees and costs resulting from the appeals process and settlement agreements between agencies and plaintiffs , if deemed to be cost - effective .
we also compared the amounts of attorneys' fees and costs reported by agencies to the amounts of attorneys' fees and costs assessed by courts , as reported by justice , in order to identify any discrepancies between these amounts .
 ( for this study , we established that if a plaintiff was awarded attorneys' fees and costs , then the plaintiff had substantially prevailed in the lawsuit ) .this resulted in our identification of 112 lawsuits across 28 federal agencies where the courts had awarded attorneys' fees and costs .
of this total number of lawsuits , we identified those lawsuits in which information indicated that the courts or a stipulation had awarded attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs .
