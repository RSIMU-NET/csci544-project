according to the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , an attack on a surface transportation system in the united states could potentially lead to significant casualties and economic damage and disruption worth billions of dollars .
to collectively address these objectives , we reviewed relevant statutes , regulations , and strategic documents , such as provisions in the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( 9 / 11 commission act ) , tsa surface security and related regulations , and tsa's national strategy for transportation security 2016 , among others .
this report examines ( 1 ) how tsa surface inspectors implement the agency's surface transportation security mission and ( 2 ) the extent to which tsa has used a risk - based approach to prioritize and implement surface inspector activities .
we recommended that tsa conduct a risk assessment that included all elements of risk , and tsa took actions to implement the recommendation , including developing the transportation sector security risk assessment ( tssra ) in 2010 , which examines and assesses the terrorism risk for all transportation modes for which tsa is responsible .
tsa also provides guidance and encourages voluntary implementation of security best practices to surface transportation entities , and relies on cooperation from system operators , and local , state , and federal security partners .
dhs and tsa officials have stated that they use risk - based security to deliver the most effective security in the most efficient manner .
tsa , within the u.s. department of homeland security ( dhs ) , is the primary u.s. federal agency responsible for securing all four general modes of land - based transportation – mass transit and passenger rail , freight rail , highway and motor carrier , and pipeline – and supports maritime security efforts by deploying 222 surface transportation security inspectors , known as surface inspectors , in 49 locations throughout the country .
we have previously reviewed tsa surface transportation initiatives , and in march 2009 reported that tsa had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for securing mass transit and passenger rail .
tsa's role in surface transportation security varies by mode .
tsa has an annual surface security operating budget of around $111 million , which represents approximately 3 percent of tsa's total budget , while the remainder of the budget is dedicated primarily to aviation operations , according to tsa .
according to the mineta institute for transportation , terrorist attacks against surface transportation are becoming more frequent and the overall risk for a surface transportation attack has increased over the past 40 years .
for example , tsa plays a regulatory role in freight rail , passenger rail , and maritime facility security .
surface transportation systems generally rely on an open infrastructure that is difficult to monitor and secure due to its multiple access points , hubs serving multiple carriers , and in some cases , lack of access barriers .
you asked us to review the activities that tsa surface inspectors perform in support of tsa's surface security mission .
therefore , this report omits sensitive information regarding the specific risks facing particular surface transportation modes as determined by tsa .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the administrator of tsa should identify and prioritize high - risk entities and locations for tsa's risk mitigation activities for surface transportation ( rmasts ) .
