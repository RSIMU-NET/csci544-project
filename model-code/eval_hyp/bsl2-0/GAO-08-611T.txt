the general services administration ( gsa ) is responsible for developing regulations and guidance regarding the establishment of advisory committees under faca .
in addition to oge and gsa regulations and guidance , federal agencies have their own policies and procedures to establish and manage advisory committees .
the office of government ethics ( oge ) is responsible for developing regulations and guidance for federal advisory committee members serving as special government employees who must meet certain federal requirements pertaining to freedom from conflicts of interest .
as requested , my testimony today addresses ( 1 ) key findings and conclusions in our 2004 report , federal advisory committees: additional guidance could help agencies better ensure independence and balance , ( 2 ) the recommendations we made in that report to gsa and oge to address deficiencies we identified and their responses to the recommendations , and ( 3 ) potential changes to faca that could better ensure the independence and balance of advisory committees as the subcommittee considers amendments to the act .
in fiscal year 2007 , 52 agencies sponsored 915 active federal advisory committees with a total of about 65,000 members .
federal advisory committees have been called the “fifth arm of government” because of the significant role they play in advising federal agencies , the congress , and the president on important national issues .
for our 2004 work , we reviewed relevant policies and procedures issued by gsa , oge , and nine federal agencies that sponsor many advisory committees .
as we reported in 2004 , controversies regarding the federal advisory committee system have included concerns that some appointments have been based on ideology rather than expertise or were weighted to favor one group of stakeholders over others .
to be effective , advisory committees must be — and , just as importantly , be perceived as being — independent and balanced as a whole .
members appointed to federal advisory committees to provide advice on behalf of the government on the basis of their best judgment are appointed as “special government employees.” members may also be appointed to federal advisory committees as “representatives” to provide stakeholder advice — that is , advice reflecting the views of the entity or interest group they are representing , such as industry , labor , or consumers .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our 2004 report on the independence and balance of federal advisory committees in the context of possible amendments to the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) .
several recommendations remained open as of march 2008 , and we followed up with gsa and oge to identify their responses to these recommendations .
for this testimony , we supplemented our 2004 report with information we obtained from gsa and oge on actions the agencies have taken to implement our recommendations .
using the gsa faca database , we updated some advisory committee information about selected agencies and reviewed governmentwide data on appointments to advisory committees .
finally , in light of the gsa and oge responses to our recommendations and the actions taken by some agencies sponsoring advisory committees regarding appointments , we identified potential changes to faca that the congress may wish to consider to help gsa and oge better ensure independence and balance .
