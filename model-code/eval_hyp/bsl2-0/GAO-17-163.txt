in 2009 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) developed an integration center , the national cybersecurity and communications integration center ( nccic ) , to provide a central place for the various federal and private - sector organizations to coordinate efforts to address and respond to cyber threats .
the national cybersecurity protection act of 2014 requires nccic to perform several cybersecurity functions , including being a federal civilian interface for sharing information on cybersecurity - related information and facilitating cross - sector coordination to address cybersecurity risks and incidents .
cyber - based intrusions and attacks on federal systems and systems supporting our nation's critical infrastructure , such as communications and financial services , have become not only more numerous and diverse but also more damaging and disruptive .
since 1997 , we have designated federal information security as a government - wide high - risk area and , in 2003 , expanded this area to include computerized systems supporting the nation's critical infrastructure .
protecting the information and control systems on which federal operations and national critical infrastructures depend and effectively responding to cyber incidents is critical because the unauthorized disclosure , alteration , and destruction of the information on those systems can result in great harm to those involved .
more recently , in the february 2015 update to our high - risk list , we further expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information that is collected , maintained , and shared by both federal and nonfederal entities .
one principle , for example , is ensuring that timely , actionable , and relevant information related to cybersecurity risks , incidents , and analysis is shared .
in addition , the two acts included provisions for us to review nccic's efforts in carrying out its cybersecurity mission .
the cybersecurity act of 2015 subsequently established additional functions for the center , among other things .
this is illustrated by the data breach at the office of personnel management , reported in july 2015 , which impacted at least 21.5 million individuals and demonstrated the effect that such an incident can have on an agency's mission and national security .
the recipients included representatives from federal agencies and nonfederal entities , such as private - sector companies and organizations ; state , local , tribal , and territorial governments ; international partners ; and individual citizens .
the act also required the center to adhere to nine principles , to the extent practicable , in carrying out these functions .
for this review , our specific objective was to determine the extent to which nccic was performing its statutorily defined cybersecurity - related functions .
these acts together identified 11 cybersecurity functions that the center is to perform .
to do so , we reviewed the national cybersecurity protection act of 2014 and the cybersecurity act of 2015 to identify the center's statutorily defined functions and the principles for carrying out the functions .
we examined how these products and services are used in support of nccic's mandated cybersecurity functions .
critical operations , such as those supporting critical infrastructure , national defense , and emergency services , could be disrupted .
for each of the 11 functions identified in the acts , we analyzed relevant program documentation , including concepts of operations , program descriptions , analysis products , resource allocations , and performance measures .
