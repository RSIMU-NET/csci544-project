recent legislation has increased many oef / oif veterans' priority for accessing va's health care .
we have previously reported that va has experienced an increased demand for its mental health care — including care for conditions such as post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , depression , and substance abuse .
in this report , we provide information on ( 1 ) how many veterans received mental health care from va from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 , ( 2 ) key barriers that may hinder veterans from accessing mental health care from va , and ( 3 ) efforts va has implemented to increase veterans' access to va mental health care .
given the increased focus on oef / oif veterans , concerns have been raised by some , including veterans service organizations ( vso ) , about the extent to which va is providing mental health care to eligible veterans of all eras .
additionally , there are concerns that barriers — such as distance from a va treatment facility or stigma associated with mental health care — may hinder some veterans from accessing needed mental health care .
for example , mental health conditions can lead to increased risks of unemployment , homelessness , and suicide .
va provides care to eligible veterans from all eras of service , including world war ii , korea , vietnam , gulf war , and most recently , military operations in afghanistan and iraq — operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , respectively .
when veterans do not receive the mental health care they need , wide - ranging and negative implications for their physical , work , family , and social functioning can result .
in fiscal year 2010 , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , which operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation , provided health care to about 5.2 million veterans .
in addition , we did not assess the extent to which va has fully implemented these efforts or their effectiveness , including the extent to which the efforts eliminate or diminish barriers that may hinder veterans from accessing mental health care .
you expressed interest in obtaining information on veterans who receive mental health care from va .
to perform our work , we obtained data from va's northeast program evaluation center ( nepec ) on the number of veterans who received mental health care from va from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 .
to corroborate the barriers we identified in the literature , we interviewed officials from ( 1 ) several va offices — the office of mental health services , the office of mental health operations , the office of rural health , the office of research and development , and readjustment counseling services ; ( 2 ) several mental health – focused va research centers — the mental illness research , education and clinical center , the serious mental illness treatment resource and evaluation center , the center for chronic disease outcomes research , and the national center for ptsd ; ( 3 ) several va mental health and primary care providers ; and ( 4 ) a judgmental sample of vsos .
