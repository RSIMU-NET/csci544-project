 ( 2 ) what effect has bbce had on program costs ? .
from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2012 , the number of states with bbce policies increased from 7 to 43 .
although usda has encouraged states to adopt bbce to improve snap access and simplify administration , little is known about the impact of bbce on snap .
however , since 1999 , usda has allowed states to expand categorical eligibility to households authorized to receive tanf - funded non - cash services by adopting broad - based categorical eligibility ( bbce ) policies .
 ( 3 ) what are the program integrity implications , if any , of bbce ? .
as a result , we were asked to assess: ( 1 ) to what extent are households that would otherwise be ineligible for snap deemed eligible for the program under bbce ? .
while some of the recent increases in snap participation and costs are due to the recession and benefit increases included in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) , state policy changes intended to improve program access and simplify the administration of snap may also have had an effect .
while snap eligibility limits therefore differ among states that have adopted bbce policies , the amount of assistance eligible households receive is determined using the same process for all snap applicants .
as a result , for years , fns has encouraged states to undertake outreach efforts and adopt various modifications to program policy to increase participation among the eligible population and increase program efficiency .
over the last 10 years , snap participation has more than doubled and costs have quadrupled .
under bbce policies , states align the snap household income and asset limits in federal law with the income and asset limits for the relevant tanf - funded non - cash service .
in addition , low - income households are categorically eligible for snap if they receive benefits from certain other federal programs , such as temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) .
as criteria for our review , we examined federal laws affecting snap , as well as usda regulations and guidance related to snap and specifically to bbce .
because households must be low - income to receive snap benefits , participation and costs typically increase during economic downturns as more people become eligible and apply .
originally , categorical eligibility was designed as a method by which households receiving cash assistance benefits were deemed snap - eligible .
as shown in figures 1 and 2 , snap participation and costs generally increased between fiscal years 2001 and 2011 , though the most significant increases began in fiscal year 2008 .
during fiscal year 2011 , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , previously known as the food stamp program , provided food and nutrition assistance to almost 45 million individuals each month for a total of $71.8 billion in benefits for the year .
according to fns , the growth in snap participation in recent years is likely attributable to the economic recession , outreach efforts , and modifications to program policy .
under federal law , eligibility for snap is based primarily on whether a household's income and assets fall below certain thresholds .
