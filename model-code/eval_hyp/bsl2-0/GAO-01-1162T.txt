faa's efforts to address these problems have been slow .
our testimony is based on our prior work and includes assessments of security concerns with ( 1 ) aviation - related computer systems , ( 2 ) airport access controls , and ( 3 ) passenger and carry - on baggage screening , including how the united states and selected other countries differ in their screening practices .
we recommended that faa develop an integrated plan to focus its efforts , set priorities , and measure progress in improving screening .
billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system .
as we reported last year , our reviews of the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) oversight of air traffic control ( atc ) computer systems showed that faa had not followed some critical aspects of its own security requirements .
our testimony will also offer some observations about improving aviation security in these various areas .
faa is addressing these recommendations , but progress on one key effort — the certification of screening companies — is still not complete because the implementing regulation has not been issued .
although it is not fully known at this time what actually occurred or what all the weaknesses in the nation's aviation security apparatus are that contributed to the horrendous events of last week , it is clear that serious weaknesses exist in our aviation security system and that their impact can be far more devastating than previously imagined .
faa is making some progress in addressing the 22 recommendations we made to improve computer security , but most have yet to be completed .
it is now nearly 2 ½ years since faa originally planned to implement the regulation .
a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation .
we are here today to discuss the vulnerabilities that we have identified throughout the nation's aviation system .
controls for limiting access to secure areas , including aircraft , have not always worked as intended .
additional considerations for the immediate future could include prioritizing outstanding recommendations that address security , developing a strategic plan to address the recommendations , assigning specific executive responsibility for carrying out this plan , and identifying the sources and amounts of funding needed .
yet , to further minimize the vulnerabilities in our aviation security system , more needs to be done .
additionally , too little attention has been given to factors such as the sufficiency of the training given to screeners .
as a result , the atc system was susceptible to intrusion and malicious attacks .
their screening operations require more extensive qualifications and training for screeners , include higher pay and better benefits , and often include different screening techniques , such as “pat - downs” of some passengers .
specifically , faa had not ensured that atc buildings and facilities were secure , that the systems themselves were protected , and that the contractors who access these systems had undergone background checks .
faa is acting on the weaknesses we identified and is implementing improvements to more closely check the credentials of law enforcement officers .
