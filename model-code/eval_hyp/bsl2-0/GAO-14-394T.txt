accordingly , this testimony addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which interior continues to face challenges hiring and retaining key oil and gas staff and the causes of these challenges , ( 2 ) interior's efforts to address its hiring and retention challenges , and ( 3 ) the effects of hiring and retention challenges on interior's oversight of oil and gas activities .
the bureau of land management ( blm ) oversees onshore federal oil and gas activities , the bureau of ocean energy management ( boem ) oversees offshore oil and gas leasing , and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement ( bsee ) reviews applications for drilling and inspects offshore oil and gas activities .
increasing oil prices , along with advances in technologies , such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale plays onshore , and deepwater drilling offshore , have made it possible to develop substantially more oil and gas resources .
such technological advances make it imperative that interior hire and retain sufficient staff to oversee oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters .
interior's management of oil and gas activities on federal leases has been the focus of a large body of our work over the past several years , and we have reported on the weaknesses and challenges to interior's oversight of federal oil and gas and recommended specific actions to address them .
in 2012 , onshore federal leases produced 13 percent of domestic natural gas and 5 percent of domestic oil , while in 2011 — the most recent year for which data are available — offshore federal leases produced almost 24 percent of domestic natural gas and over 6 percent of domestic oil .
in july 2012 , we reported , among other things , that boem and bsee continued to face challenges hiring and retaining staff for oversight of oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico , and did not have strategic workforce plans in place to outline strategies to address their human capital challenges .
in february 2011 , we added interior's management of federal oil and gas resources to gao's list of programs at high risk of fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement in part because of interior's long - standing and continued human capital challenges .
within interior , three bureaus are responsible for regulating the processes that oil and gas companies must follow when leasing , drilling , and producing oil and gas from federal leases .
in this context , my testimony today discusses the findings from our recent january 2014 report on interior's challenges in hiring and retaining sufficient staff to manage oil and gas activities on federal leases , as well as the status of recommendations from our prior work relating to interior's human capital challenges .
in recent years , federal leases onshore and in offshore federal waters produced a substantial portion of the natural gas and oil produced in the united states .
interior plays an important role in permitting the development of new oil and gas wells on federal lands and waters and inspecting those wells to ensure compliance with environmental , safety , and other regulations .
our january report included the results of a survey of management officials representing all 44 interior offices responsible for oil and gas oversight operations — 3 boem regional offices , 5 bsee district offices and 3 bsee regional offices , and 33 blm field offices and 1 blm state office .
