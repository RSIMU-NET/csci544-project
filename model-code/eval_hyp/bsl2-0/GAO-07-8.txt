in fiscal year 2005 , the social security administration ( ssa ) paid about $126 billion to approximately 12.8 million beneficiaries under the disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs .
ssa is required to conduct periodic continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) to ensure that only eligible people continue to receive benefits .
in response , congress passed the social security disability benefits reform act of 1984 ( the act ) , which among other things established a medical improvement standard ( the standard ) .
in recent years , both programs have grown and are poised to grow even faster as the baby boom generation enters its disability - prone years .
these reviews assess whether individuals are still eligible for benefits based on their current medical condition and ability to work , among other criteria .
given this observation and the continued growth in the di and ssi programs , the senate committee on finance asked us to ( 1 ) examine the proportion of beneficiaries who are removed from the disability programs because they have improved medically and ( 2 ) determine if factors associated with the standard pose challenges when determining whether beneficiaries continue to be eligible for benefits .
these disability programs provide income support and in most cases , access to medical care for people unable to work due to physical or mental impairments , or both .
to address these questions , we reviewed the act , regulations , and ssa guidance and processes for evaluating whether beneficiaries continue to be eligible for benefits .
since the standard has been implemented , some observers have suggested that certain factors associated with the standard may lead ssa to continue benefits for some individuals who might otherwise be able to work .
for example , ssa expects that by 2010 the number of di beneficiaries and their eligible family members will increase by more than one - third over 2001 levels .
when ssa was conducting these reviews in the early 1980s , there were concerns that some beneficiaries were being arbitrarily removed from the programs .
if ssa determines that the standard has been met in the course of conducting a cdr , the beneficiary may continue to receive benefits until the individual receives another cdr ( which potentially could result in a discontinuation of benefits ) , dies , or transitions into social security retirement benefits .
we examined ssa data on cdr outcomes for a 7- year period ( fiscal years 1999 to 2005 ) .
under this standard , unless certain exceptions apply , ssa must find improvement in a beneficiary's medical condition and that the individual is able to work in order to discontinue benefits .
furthermore , we conducted a national survey of all 55 disability determination services ( dds ) directors and received 54 completed responses to achieve a response rate of 98 percent .
however , ssa is taking actions intended to address some of these problems .
the social security administration ( ssa ) administers two programs under the social security act that provide benefits to people with disabilities: ( 1 ) disability insurance ( di ) and ( 2 ) supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
we looked only at di and ssi adult beneficiaries .
