specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the status of hud's current efforts to promote energy efficiency and the performance measures the agency uses to assess these efforts ; ( 2 ) the potential costs and long - term benefits of incorporating green building practices into hud's affordable housing programs ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned elsewhere that hud could apply to promoting green building practices in its programs .
energy efficiency and other forms of resource conservation are relevant to most hud housing programs , which incur energy costs as well as other resource expenses ( such as water expenses and building materials for new or existing housing units ) .
according to hud officials , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) spends an estimated $5 billion — more than 10 percent of its budget — on energy costs , either directly in the form of public housing operating subsidies or indirectly through utility allowances and contracts for assisted multifamily housing .
in 2001 , hud established an energy task force , which adopted an energy action plan aimed at promoting energy efficiency in public and assisted housing and in housing financed through its competitive and formula grant programs .
as part of this plan , hud has disseminated information and provided training on energy efficiency , offered incentives for green building practices in some programs , and tracked energy performance measures for some of its programs .
for example , hud administers federal aid to local public housing authorities ( pha ) that manage public housing developments for about 1.2 million low - income households .
many of these expenditures are for older properties , which often have higher energy - related operating costs than newer ones .
in 2006 , hud outlined its energy strategy , which updated the energy action plan in compliance with a provision in the energy policy act of 2005 that directed the agency to develop a department wide strategy for reducing energy costs in assisted and public housing .
we also examined hud's legal authority to incorporate mandatory green building requirements into its affordable housing programs ( see app .
residents of some hud - assisted housing who are responsible for their own utilities are also affected by high energy prices .
the costs associated with this energy usage are particularly significant for low - income individuals .
in light of the opportunities associated with green building for hud and residents of hud - sponsored housing and interest in hud's efforts to promote green building practices , you asked us to review the actions that hud has taken to promote green building and issues related to those efforts .
hud also administers billions of dollars in grant programs to local jurisdictions that support a range of activities , including the development of housing and rental assistance , and federally regulates all new manufactured homes under a national building code .
residential buildings in the united states accounted for an estimated 22 percent of the nation's total energy consumption and an estimated 18 percent of the country's total carbon emissions in 2005 , a fact that could contribute to long - term global climate change .
in addition , hud assists privately owned and operated properties to help provide affordable housing for over 3 million households .
