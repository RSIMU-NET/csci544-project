congress has been closely involved in formulating u.s. policy on surplus plutonium disposition , as well as funding the necessary facilities , operations , and russian assistance to implement the program .
because of sharply rising cost estimates for plutonium disposition facilities under construction in south carolina , the obama administration proposed in its fy2017 budget request to end construction and pursue a "dilute and dispose" ( d&d ) option .
particular u.s. concern focused on plutonium from soviet nuclear warheads , which it was feared posed a major nuclear weap ons proliferation risk .
the united states initially intended to pursue both immobilization and mox fuel for conventional reactors .
the united states supported a successful effort to consolidate the storage of soviet nuclear weapons and materials in russia , and then began negotiating reductions in weapons material stockpiles .
however , after reviewing u.s. nonproliferation policies in 2001 , the bush administration concluded that the dual approach would be too costly .
the trump administration proposed the same strategy in its fy2018 budget request .
the plutonium disposition program , including u.s. assistance for the russian program , is administered by the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a semiautonomous agency of the department of energy ( doe ) .
113-29 ) and the fy2015 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( p.l .
the agreement was designed to ease concerns about the possible theft or diversion of weapons - grade plutonium by nations or others seeking to develop their own nuclear weapons .
the united states pledged to pay $400 million to support the russian plutonium disposition .
full - year fy2018 appropriations for the federal government have not been enacted .
in september 1998 , the united states and russia each agreed to convert 34 metric tons of surplus weapons - grade plutonium to a form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons under the plutonium management and disposition agreement ( pmda ) .
nnsa estimated in 2002 that mfff would cost about $1 billion to design and build .
the russian government was to fund the remainder of the approximately $2.5 billion in estimated costs .
the fy2015 national defense authorization act ( p.l .
instead , it outlined a plan for the united states to convert almost all its surplus plutonium to mox fuel .
however , russia had expressed little interest in the permanent immobilization and disposal of plutonium , or burning it in conventional reactors , preferring to use the material as fuel for its civilian fast reactor program .
an omnibus fy2018 appropriations bill passed by the house ( h.r .
doe's fy2015 budget justification said the total lifecycle cost of the mox fuel program for plutonium disposition — including construction , operations , waste management , and facility decommissioning — had risen to $30 billion .
according to the agreement , the parties could use two methods for disposing of the plutonium — they could either convert it to mixed oxide ( mox ) fuel for nuclear power reactors or immobilize it and dispose of it in a way that would preclude its use in nuclear weapons .
the senate appropriations committee's fy2018 energy and water development appropriations bill ( s. 1609 ) accepted the administration's request for $270 million to terminate mfff construction and included $9 million for alternative plutonium disposal planning .
