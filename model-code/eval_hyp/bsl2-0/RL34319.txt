a sharp reduction in those inflows likely would complicate domestic efforts at making and conducting economic policies .
these foreign capital inflows allow the nation to support expenditures exceeding its current output level and finance its trade deficit .
to date , the world economy has benefitted from the stimulus provided by the nation's combination of fiscal and monetary policies and a trade deficit .
concerns are also growing that over the long run u.s. economic policies and the accompanying large deficit in its international trade accounts could have a negative impact on global economic developments , especially for the economically less developed countries .
the large foreign accumulation of u.s. securities has spurred some observers to argue that this foreign presence in u.s. financial markets increases the risk of a financial crisis , whether as a result of the uncoordinated actions of market participants or by a coordinated withdrawal from u.s. financial markets by foreign investors for economic or political reasons .
foreign investors now hold slightly less than 55% of the publicly held and publicly traded u.s. treasury securities , 26% of corporate bonds , and about 12% of u.s. corporate stocks .
similarly , capital inflows allow federal , state , and local governments to finance their budget deficits at rates that are lower than they would be otherwise .
congress likely would find itself embroiled in any such economic or financial crisis through its direct role in conducting fiscal policy and in its indirect role in the conduct of monetary policy through its supervisory responsibility over the federal reserve .
some observers are also concerned that the financial crisis has damaged the international financial system and raise concerns about the u.s. leadership role .
these observers argue that the vast sums of dollars held and managed by some foreign governments , termed sovereign wealth funds , raise the prospects of such a coordinated withdrawal , because the funds potentially increase the ability of foreign governments to instigate a rapid withdrawal .
also , concerns over the ability of the federal government to service its foreign debt and a loss of confidence in the ability of national u.s. policy makers to conduct economic policies that are perceived abroad as prudent and stabilizing could spur some foreign investors to reassess their estimates of the risks involved in holding dollar - denominated assets .
however , should a large group of foreign investors make a permanent shift in their strategies to limit or to reduce their purchases of u.s. securities , such actions likely would complicate efforts to finance budget deficits .
such inflows bridge the gap between u.s. supplies and demands for credit , thereby allowing consumers and businesses to finance purchases at interest rates that are lower than they would be without overseas capital inflows .
the rapid expansion of market activity through the consolidation of equity exchanges and the development of complex financial instruments and hybrid securities that are traded across national borders has raised additional concerns that financial innovations have outpaced the efforts of regulators .
although unlikely , a coordinated withdrawal from u.s. financial markets potentially could be staged by foreign investors for economic or political reasons or it could arise as a result of an uncoordinated correction in market prices .
some observers are concerned that a foreign investor with significant holdings in the united states or a group of foreign investors could engage in an abrupt and large - scale liquidation of dollar - denominated securities , particularly a sell - off of u.s. treasury securities .
