tsa , within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , has primary oversight responsibility for the physical security and cybersecurity of transmission and distribution pipeline systems .
tsa's security policy and industry engagement's pipeline security branch is charged with managing its pipeline security program .
the pipeline security branch is responsible for conducting voluntary security reviews — corporate security reviews ( csr ) and critical facility security reviews ( cfsr ) — which assess the extent to which the 100 most critical pipeline systems are following the intent of tsa's pipeline security guidelines .
in march 2018 , the federal bureau of investigation and the national cybersecurity and communications integration center ( nccic ) reported that a nation - state had targeted organizations within multiple u.s. critical infrastructure sectors , including the energy sector , and collected information pertaining to industrial control systems .
new threats to the nation's pipeline systems have evolved to include sabotage by environmental activists and cyber - attack or intrusion by nations .
a disruption of any magnitude may affect other domestic critical infrastructure and industries that are dependent on pipeline system commodities .
a minor pipeline system disruption could result in commodity price increases , while prolonged pipeline disruptions could lead to widespread energy shortages .
for example , in october 2016 environmental activists forced the shutdown of five crude oil pipelines in four states .
the pipeline security branch first issued its voluntary pipeline security guidelines in 2011 and released revised guidelines in march 2018 .
given that many pipelines transport volatile , flammable , or toxic oil and liquids , and given the potential consequences of a successful physical or cyber - attack , pipeline systems are attractive targets for terrorists , hackers , foreign nations , criminal groups , and others with malicious intent .
however , we also identified weaknesses in several areas of tsa's pipeline security program management , including: ( 1 ) updating and clarifying pipeline security guidelines ; ( 2 ) planning for workforce needs ; ( 3 ) assessing pipeline risks ; and ( 4 ) monitoring program performance .
in addition , pipelines increasingly rely on sophisticated networked computerized systems and electronic data , which are vulnerable to cyber - attack or intrusion .
the interstate pipeline system runs through both remote and highly populated urban areas , and it is vulnerable to accidents , operating errors , and malicious attacks .
cfsrs are voluntary on - site inspections of critical pipeline facilities , as well as other select pipeline facilities , throughout the nation .
for this report , we reviewed and analyzed relevant documents from tsa and other federal entities , evaluated tsa pipeline risk assessment efforts , and interviewed tsa officials , including officials within tsa's pipeline security branch .
tsa officials stated that the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of the agency's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks was through conducting pipeline security reviews — csrs and cfsrs .
csrs are voluntary on - site reviews of a pipeline owner's corporate policies and procedures .
however , while tsa does track cfsr recommendations , we found that tsa had not tracked the status of csr recommendations for security improvements in over 5 years — information necessary for tsa to effectively monitor pipeline operators' progress in improving their security posture .
