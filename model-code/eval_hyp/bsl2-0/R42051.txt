it also reauthorized appropriations for many existing grant programs .
the costs of expanding public and private health insurance coverage and other spending are offset by revenues from new taxes and fees , and by savings from payment and health care delivery system reforms designed to slow the growth in spending on medicare and other federal health care programs .
implementing aca also is affecting discretionary spending , which is provided in and controlled by annual appropriations acts .
aca also includes numerous mandatory appropriations to fund temporary programs to increase access and funding for targeted groups , provide funding to states to plan and establish exchanges , and support many other research and demonstration programs and activities .
medicaid law allows the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) to withhold existing federal medicaid matching funds if states refuse to comply with the expansion .
aca is projected to have a significant impact on federal direct spending and revenues .
the law includes direct spending to subsidize the purchase of health insurance coverage through the exchanges , as well as increased outlays for the expansion of state medicaid programs .
aca also amends the medicare program in an effort to reduce the rate of its projected growth ; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans found to have high premiums ; and makes many other changes to the tax code , medicare , medicaid , the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and other federal programs .
this report examines how automatic spending reductions triggered by the bca might affect health reform implementation under aca .
the law established numerous new grant programs and provided for each an authorization of appropriations .
the sequestration also requires reductions of 5.0% to nonexempt nondefense discretionary spending , 2% to medicare , and 5.1% to other nonexempt nondefense mandatory programs .
in addition to expanding private health insurance coverage , aca , as enacted , requires state medicaid programs to expand coverage to all eligible nonelderly , non - pregnant individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level ( fpl ) .
these annual spending reductions were triggered by the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to propose , and congress and the president to enact , legislation to reduce the deficit by an amount greater than $1.2 trillion over the period fy2012-fy2021 .
there is considerable interest among policymakers in whether the automatic spending reductions triggered by the bca will impact implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) .
the fy2013 sequestration order was issued pursuant to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act ( bbedca ) , as amended by the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ) .
under aca , the federal government will initially cover 100% of the expansion costs , phasing down to 90% of the costs by 2020 .
based on the calculations of the office of management and budget ( omb ) , the fy2013 sequestration requires a 7.8% reduction in nonexempt defense discretionary spending and a 7.9% reduction in nonexempt defense direct ( i.e. , mandatory ) spending over the course of the fiscal year .
