the act also mandates us to report on dod's actions to implement the required provisions .
although compliance with the reporting requirements for performance assessments has increased , dod still faces challenges with completing assessments on time .
for this report , we ( 1 ) identified the actions taken by dod to improve the quality and timeliness of past performance information and implement provisions of the act , and ( 2 ) assessed the effectiveness of those actions .
for example , about 31,000 assessments became due during fiscal year 2012 , but dod completed over 33,000 during that year .
section 806 of the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2012 required dod to develop a strategy for ensuring that contractor past performance assessments are complete , timely , and accurate .
dod is currently working with the rest of the far council to implement this change .
as shown in table 2 , dod received comments from contractors on over 80 percent of all assessments from fiscal years 2010 through 2012 , and most were received within the current 30-day minimum requirement for responding .
dod officials told us that department - wide acquisition workforce shortages and turnover , as well as difficulty obtaining contractor performance information remain as challenges to completing contractor performance assessments on time .
to identify dod's actions to improve the timeliness and quality of contractor past performance information and implement provisions of the act , we reviewed dod policy and guidance related to contractor assessments .
the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) requires agencies to document contractor performance on contracts that exceed certain dollar thresholds and to make such information available to other agencies through a shared government - wide database .
section 806 would limit the comment period to 14 days before the assessment is submitted to ppirs , which should help dod meet the 120-day standard for submitting past performance assessments .
the need to improve both the quantity and quality of past performance information also was highlighted in a 2011 office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) report that found that dod and other federal agency contractor assessments often lacked quality narrative information , such as sufficient details about how the contractor exceeded expectations or corrected poor performance , to support the assessment .
the far currently requires that all federal contractors be given a minimum of 30 days to submit comments , rebutting statements , or additional information to performance assessments .
we also interviewed dod officials responsible for contractor past performance information at the office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics ; the three dod components — the air force , army , and navy — which account for more than 90 percent of dod's required assessments ; and the contractor performance assessment reporting system ( cpars ) and past performance information retrieval system ( ppirs ) program offices to discuss actions taken or planned .
in addition , section 806 also requires the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement ( dfars ) to be revised to require that contractor assessments be posted to the databases used for making source selection decisions no later than 14 days after delivery of the performance assessment to the contractor .
