house conference report 109-241 , which accompanied the department of homeland security appropriations act , 2006 ( public law 109-90 ) directed that we report on the reasons for cost increases in maintaining tsa's explosive detection systems , including tsa's contracting practices that may have affected cost increases .
tsa has used contractors to perform preventative and corrective maintenance on these eds and etd machines .
subsequently , in may 2006 , the house appropriations committee stated in its report accompanying the department of homeland security appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 its long - standing concerns about the increasing costs for eds and etd maintenance and specifically , tsa's recovery of any excess award fees from a previous eds and etd contractor .
by the end of fiscal year 2006 , tsa will have deployed over 1,400 eds and 6,600 etd machines at baggage - screening locations in over 400 airports nationwide , according to tsa budget documents .
i ) , which has been updated as appropriate in this report .
further , the report stated that tsa should submit a report to the house appropriations committee on any actions it has taken to collect excessive award fees , how much has been received to date , and specific plans to obligate these collections .
after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , which highlighted the vulnerability of u.s. aircraft to acts of terrorism , congress passed and the president signed into law the aviation and transportation security act ( atsa ) , mandating , among other things , that all checked baggage at u.s. airports be screened using explosive detection systems by december 31 , 2002 .
what has tsa done to control eds and etd maintenance costs ? .
with regard to this requirement , on april 19 , 2006 , we provided you with information on the results of our review ( see app .
what factors played a role in eds and etd maintenance costs , and what factors could affect future costs ? .
to meet this requirement , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) deployed two types of equipment to screen checked baggage for explosives: ( 1 ) explosive detection systems ( eds ) that use specialized x - rays to detect characteristics of explosives that may be contained in baggage as it moves along a conveyor belt and ( 2 ) explosive trace detection ( etd ) machines , whereby an individual ( i.e. , a baggage screener , or transportation security officer ) swabs baggage and then inserts the swab into the etd machine , which in turn can detect chemical residues that may indicate the presence of explosives within a bag .
to address our objectives , we reviewed tsa contract files and related cost data , tsa processes for reviewing contract performance data , budget documents for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 , acquisition and strategic plans , a department of homeland security's office of the inspector general ( dhs oig ) report , gao standards for internal controls , and our previous work on tsa's acquisition function .
pursuant to atsa , tsa assumed operational responsibility for conducting the screening of checked baggage , which includes the procurement , installation , and maintenance of eds and etd machines .
