concerned about declining military readiness , congress has provided substantial funding in response to department of defense ( dod ) funding requests .
specifically , i will address ( 1 ) the cost of the army's plans to implement these initiatives , and ( 2 ) the management challenges facing the army and the actions needed to improve its implementation of these initiatives .
amid ongoing operations , the army must also reset ( repair or replace ) existing equipment that has been used in harsh environments overseas .
both of these initiatives will create requirements for significant quantities of new equipment .
however , significant challenges continue to face the army as it attempts to simultaneously support ongoing operations , improve the readiness of nondeployed units , and transform its force for the future .
key initiatives include plans to restructure the army from divisions to standardized modular brigades as well as expand the force by more than 74,000 soldiers .
further , the army has taken much of its pre - positioned stock out of storage to support combat operations and these critical reserve stocks will need to be replenished .
as you requested , my testimony will focus on the equipping implications of restructuring and expanding the army ; efforts to repair , replace , and recapitalize equipment through the army's reset program ; and reconstitution of prepositioned equipment .
moreover , growing fiscal problems facing the nation may lead to growing pressure on defense budgets .
the army has undertaken a number of initiatives to restructure and rebuild its force in the midst of ongoing overseas operations .
such uncertainty about the future underscores the need for sound management approaches like setting goals , establishing clear measures to track progress , and identifying full costs .
restoring equipment readiness across the army will require billions of dollars in maintenance and procurement funding but the full cost — and how long it will take — are still unclear .
the uncertainty about the magnitude and duration of our military commitments further complicates and deepens the equipping challenges facing the army .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to army equipment in light of the high pace and long duration of operations in iraq and afghanistan as well as the army's plans to modernize and transform its capabilities .
for example , the army is likely to continue to have shortfalls of some key equipment beyond then and believes it will require additional funding to equip modular units through fiscal year 2017 .
since 2004 , we have examined the army's plans and funding for the four initiatives , and determined the extent to which the army's plans were comprehensive and transparent .
however , these estimates have limitations and could change .
we are also issuing a separate statement today on the army's future combat system , a longer term transformation effort that comprises 14 integrated weapon systems and an advanced information network and which is estimated to cost about $160 billion .
related reports are listed at the end of this testimony and include reviews of the army's equipping and reset strategies , prepositioned equipment , modular restructuring , and efforts to expand the army .
