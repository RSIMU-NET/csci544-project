during fiscal year 1994 ( which , for the majority of states , included 9 months of the states' first fiscal year under cmia ) , the federal government obligated over a reported $150 billion in federal funds to the states for programs covered under the act .
this legislation responds to previously alleged instances in which either the states drew cash advances well before federal funds were needed to make payment or states used their own funds to satisfy federal program needs and were not reimbursed in a timely manner by the federal agencies .
the three key agents in the exchange are the department of the treasury's financial management service ( fms ) , federal program agencies , and the 56 states and territories .
it addresses the flow of billions of dollars monthly to states to administer numerous federal programs involving payments to individuals or vendors .
the act required the secretary of the treasury , along with the states , to establish equitable funds transfer procedures , and provided that states would pay interest to the federal government if they draw funds in advance of need and that the federal government would pay interest to states if the federal program agency does not reimburse the states in a timely manner when states use their own funds .
the cash management improvement act ( cmia ) of 1990 , as amended ( public law 101-453 ) , focuses on promoting equity in the exchange of funds between the federal government and the states .
the act provides a framework for calculating interest liabilities of the state and federal government and calls for an annual exchange of the net interest owed by either party .
this report , which is required by cmia , assesses these entities' implementation during 1994 â€” the first year of the act .
most state officials acknowledged that cmia has helped heighten their awareness of cash management , but several expressed concern over what they viewed as added administrative burden .
our review showed that the department of the treasury , federal program agencies , and the states have made substantial progress in achieving the act's purpose of timely transfers of funds .
fms officials have made substantial efforts to enable successful implementation .
while the three key agents have made progress in implementing cmia , three of the states we visited consistently did not comply with certain treasury rules and regulations .
these programs were funded by the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) , labor , education , agriculture , transportation and the social security administration .
fms also plans to eliminate the prohibition on reimbursable funding to provide states with greater flexibility in funding techniques .
during fiscal year 1994 ( which , for the majority of states , included 9 months of the states' first fiscal year under cmia ) , the federal government obligated over a reported $150 billion in federal funds to the states for programs covered under the act .
it authorized the secretary to issue regulations establishing such procedures for states with which the secretary has been unable to reach agreement .
the federal program agencies are required to ( 1 ) schedule transfers of funds to the states so as to minimize the time elapsing between the disbursement of federal funds from the u.s. treasury and the issuance and redemption of checks , warrants , or payments by other means by a state and ( 2 ) upon treasury's request , review annual reports submitted by the states for reasonableness and accuracy .
