specifically , we agreed to identify ( 1 ) examples of how federal agencies are innovatively using it , either individually or in collaboration with other agencies or levels of government , to facilitate regulatory management ; ( 2 ) examples of how state regulatory agencies are innovatively using it to facilitate regulatory management ; ( 3 ) it applications that representatives of nongovernmental organizations believe could be more widely used by federal regulatory agencies ; and ( 4 ) what officials and staff in federal and state regulatory agencies and nongovernmental organizations believe are the key factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption and diffusion of innovative it applications in regulatory management .
the use of it in regulatory management can reduce regulatory burden ; improve the transparency of regulatory processes ; and , ultimately , facilitate the accomplishment of regulatory objectives .
the parties relevant to each of these objectives ( i.e. , federal or state agencies and nongovernmental organizations ) identified which applications they considered “innovative. .
one area of public policy that is beginning to feel the effects of it is regulatory management , which includes such interrelated processes as rulemaking , compliance assistance , information collection and dissemination , and regulatory enforcement .
last year , we reported on innovative uses of it to facilitate public participation in federal rulemaking .
during the past several years , information technology ( it ) has played an increasingly important role in how federal agencies interact with the public and accomplish their missions .
sometimes referred to as “electronic government” or “e - gov,” the use of it has already changed how public policy is developed and administered in a variety of areas and has the potential to introduce even more changes in the future .
this report responds to your request that we examine the use of it in other aspects of regulatory management .
several legislative initiatives enacted during the past decade have emphasized the potential of it to improve the federal government's performance .
we focused our efforts regarding the first objective on the departments of agriculture ( usda ) ; labor ( dol ) ; health and human services ( hhs ) ; and transportation ( dot ) and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
for example , the paperwork reduction act of 1995 ( pra ) requires the director of the office of management and budget ( omb ) to “promote the use of information technology to improve the productivity , efficiency , and effectiveness of federal programs , including through dissemination of public information and the reduction of information collection burdens on the public.” the information technology management reform act of 1996 ( known as the clinger - cohen act ) also requires the omb director to “promote and be responsible for improving the acquisition , use , and disposal of information technology by the federal government to improve the productivity , efficiency , and effectiveness of federal programs , including through dissemination of public information and the reduction of information collection burdens on the public.” additionally , the government paperwork elimination act ( gpea ) requires the omb director to ensure that federal agencies “provide for the option of electronic maintenance , submission , or disclosure of information , when practicable as a substitute for paper” by october 2003 .
