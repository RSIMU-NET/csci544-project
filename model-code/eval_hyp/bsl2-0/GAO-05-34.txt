however , nasa's decision has prompted considerable debate .
nasa also recognized that a hubble servicing mission would necessitate further changes both to shuttle hardware and operational procedures .
congressional members , scientists , and space policy experts have called for an examination of alternatives to prolong hubble's mission , such as the possibility of servicing hubble robotically .
nasa said that its decision to cancel the servicing mission was based largely on concerns about shuttle safety â€” specifically , the need to implement recommendations made by the columbia accident investigation board ( caib ) for safely returning the space shuttle to flight .
with no future servicing missions , nasa anticipates that hubble will cease to support scientific investigations by the end of the decade .
this report addresses the basis for nasa's cost estimates to ( 1 ) service the hubble telescope by using the shuttle and ( 2 ) implement the caib's recommendations , including those recommendations directly related to safely returning the shuttle to flight .
hubble's continued operation has been dependent on nasa's space shuttle fleet , which carried crewmembers to the telescope to perform periodic maintenance and upgrades .
the caib chairman suggested that only a study of the benefits and risks of a shuttle servicing mission to extend hubble's life could determine whether it is worth the risks .
the grounding of the shuttle fleet following the tragic loss of space shuttle columbia in february 2003 put these missions to hubble on hold , and in january 2004 , nasa announced its decision to cancel the fifth and final planned hubble servicing mission .
for more than a decade , the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) hubble space telescope has provided unique images of the universe and has given scientists critical data needed to help understand a number of space mysteries .
to assess the basis for nasa's hubble servicing mission cost estimate , we examined nasa's rationale for its decision to cancel the final planned shuttle servicing mission , analyzed available funding estimates , and requested analytical and documentary support for selected high - dollar items to identify the sufficiency of support .
in reviewing the basis for nasa's cost estimate for implementing the caib's recommendations , we analyzed available funding estimates and requested analytical and documentary support for selected high dollar portions of the estimate to determine the sufficiency of such support .
we are continuing our work on your request that we examine the potential cost of a robotic servicing mission to the hubble telescope .
we performed our review from march through september 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
without this knowledge , a program's estimated cost could be understated and thereby subject to underfunding and cost overruns , putting programs at risk of being reduced in scope or requiring additional funding to meet their objectives .
nasa has determined that the additional funds needed to perform a shuttle servicing mission for hubble would be in the range of $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion .
