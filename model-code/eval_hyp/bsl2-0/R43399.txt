it projects that elimination of tariffs and just 10% of non - tariff barriers could raise u.s. vehicle and parts exports to the eu by over 200% and eu parts and vehicle exports to the united states by 71% .
the alliance estimates that current non - tariff barriers on vehicles are equivalent to a 26% tariff on vehicle imports .
the negotiations , the president wrote , would seek greater compatibility of u.s. and eu regulations and related standards development processes , with the objective of reducing costs associated with unnecessary regulatory differences and facilitating trade , inter alia by promoting transparency in the development and implementation of regulations and good regulatory practices , establishing mechanisms for future progress , and pursuing regulatory cooperation initiatives where appropriate .
such steps , an industry alliance has contended , would "increase trade , lower costs , create jobs and improve the international competitiveness of the industry" in both north america and europe .
safety , fuel efficiency , and emissions standards differ between the two regions ( see table 1 ) , due to historical differences in producer and consumer preferences as well as the role of government in industry practices .
some of these differences may reflect past efforts to protect domestic vehicle industries against foreign competition , and others may result from different legal traditions or divergent views as to the best way of achieving goals such as cleaner air and reduced oil consumption .
motor vehicle safety and emissions standards are areas where the united states and the eu could break new ground .
the major u.s. and european motor vehicle manufacturer associations have called for ttip to provide for mutual recognition of existing technical standards and the creation of a u.s. - eu process for harmonization of future vehicle regulations .
such an agreement , the working group urged , should provide for "the promotion of more compatible approaches to current and future regulation and standard - setting and other means of reducing non - tariff barriers to trade. .
one month later , president obama notified congress that the united states would enter into negotiations with the eu to seek a free trade agreement , referred to as the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) .
trade in vehicles and parts between the united states and the eu reached $57 billion in 2012 , and numerous companies manufacture on both sides of the atlantic .
past auto agreements have been effective in leading to a more globalized auto industry .
in november 2011 , president obama and leaders of the european union ( eu ) named a high level working group on jobs and growth to recommend steps to broaden transatlantic economic ties .
the 1965 motor vehicle agreement between the united states and canada and the 1994 north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) removed barriers to trade and cross - border trade in autos and established a more regional motor vehicle industry in the process .
the united states and the eu have different standards even for an item as simple as a seat belt .
with respect to the auto industry , ttip represents another effort to extend these regional templates to encompass a greater share of trade and investment .
