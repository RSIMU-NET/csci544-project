postponing investment can increase costs ; dot estimates that deferring $1 in highway resurfacing for just 2 years can require spending $4 in highway reconstruction costs to repair the damage .
in order to stretch the limited federal funds , the congress authorized some innovative uses of federal transportation funds .
for instance , the national highway system designation act of 1995 provided a number of innovative financing mechanisms , including the authorization of a state infrastructure bank ( sib ) pilot program for up to 10 states .
sibs are intended to complement traditional transportation grant programs and provide states with increased flexibility to offer many types of financial assistance , such as loans and subsidized interest rates , and provide bond or other debt - financing security tailored to fit a project's specific needs .
however , the department of transportation ( dot ) believes this investment is far short of what is needed , and dot estimates that an additional $16 billion annually is needed just to maintain — not improve — the condition and performance of the nation's highways at the 1993 level .
total public spending on the capital needs for highways and bridges was approximately $40 billion in 1993 , the most recent year for which data are available .
in addition , the dot appropriation for fiscal year 1997 provided $150 million for the pilot program and removed the 10-state limit .
this legislation also directed dot to review the financial condition of each infrastructure bank established under the pilot program and to report to the congress on the results of such review by march 1 , 1997 .
to provide you with an early snapshot of states' interest in establishing sibs , you asked that we ( 1 ) identify the extent of states' interest in the pilot program and how states might use sibs and ( 2 ) identify the benefits and barriers to states' using sibs .
the 10 states selected to participate in the pilot program can capitalize a sib in part by depositing in the sib a maximum of 10 percent of most of their federal highway funds for fiscal years 1996-97 .
to address these questions , we used a structured questionnaire to interview ( 1 ) transportation officials from 15 states that generally had expressed an interest to dot in innovative financing — 6 of which had been selected to participate in the sib pilot program — and ( 2 ) various financial representatives , such as firms that rate bonds' risk and financial condition .
before a sib can begin operations , however , it will need equity capital to get started .
at your request , we also summarized in appendix i information on states' interest in using other innovative financing mechanisms that are contained principally in the national highway system designation act of 1995 .
also , we analyzed the development of the federal sib pilot program and the state applications submitted .
appendix ii discusses our scope and methodology in more detail .
in connection with dot's fiscal year 1997 appropriation , the administration proposed expanding the sib pilot program to include additional states and to provide $250 million in highway trust fund revenue for capitalizing the banks .
