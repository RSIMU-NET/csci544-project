more changes to these provisions were made by the 2004 reauthorization .
the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) is a grants and civil rights statute which provides federal funding to the states to help provide education for children with disabilities .
these requirements were further detailed in regulations which required that local education agencies ( leas ) provide private school students an opportunity for equitable participation in program benefits and that these benefits had to be "comparable in quality , scope , and opportunity for participation to the program benefits" provided to students in the public schools .
some courts gave local authorities broad discretion to decide whether to provide services for children with disabilities in private schools which generally resulted in fewer services to such children while others attempted to equalize the costs for public and private school children .
in addition , the senate report stated that "many of the changes reflect current policy enumerated either in existing idea regulations or the no child left behind act. .
there was also a requirement that the statutory provisions relating to "child find," identifying children with disabilities , are applicable to children enrolled in private schools , including parochial schools .
105-17 , the courts of appeals that had considered these issues had sharply divergent views .
the senate report observed that "the intent of these changes is to clarify the responsibilities of leas to ensure that services to these children are provided in a fair and equitable manner. .
if a state receives funds under idea , it must make available a free , appropriate public education ( fape ) for all children with disabilities in the state .
the vagueness of the statute and the "equitable participation" standard led to differences among the states and localities and to differences among the courts .
105-17 in 1997 , states were required to set forth policies and procedures to ensure that provision was made for the participation of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools by their parents consistent with the number and location of these children .
these services could be provided to children with disabilities on the premises of private schools , including parochial , elementary and secondary schools .
the amounts expended for these services by an lea were to be equal to a proportionate amount of federal funds made available to the local educational agency under part b of idea .
the house report noted that "the bill makes a number of changes to clarify the responsibilities of local educational agencies to children with disabilities who are placed by their parents in private schools .
the idea amendments of 1997 rejected the "equitable participation"standard and provided that to the extent consistent with the number and location of children with disabilities in the state who were enrolled in private schools by their parents , provision was made for the participation of these children in programs assisted by part b by providing them with special education and related services .
the supreme court had granted certiorari in several of these cases but when congress rewrote the law in 1997 , the court vacated and remanded these cases .
the committee feels that these are important changes that will resolve a number of issues that have been the subject of an increasing amount of contention in the last few years. .
