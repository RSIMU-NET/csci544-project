the lack of interest in privatization among u.s. airports could be the result of ( 1 ) readily available financing sources for publicly owned airports ; ( 2 ) barriers or lack of incentives to privatize ; ( 3 ) the potential implications for major stakeholders ; and ( 4 ) satisfaction with the status quo .
in addition to reducing demand for government funds , privatization has been promoted as a way to make airports more efficient and financially viable .
owners of other airports considered privatization , but eventually chose not to proceed .

with respect to airports , "privatization" can take many forms up to and including the transfer of an entire airport to private operation and / or ownership .
easing limits on use of privatization revenue .
federal aip spending is ultimately determined via the budget process and therefore budget savings may or may not result from airport privatization .
congress has been interested in airport privatization as a way to save money by making airports less dependent on federal assistance while also , in the long run , increasing the nation's aviation capacity to meet growing demand for air travel .
