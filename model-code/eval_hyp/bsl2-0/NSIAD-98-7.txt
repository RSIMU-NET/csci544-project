in fiscal year 1996 , dod sold about 3.3 million usable aircraft parts to the public through the disposal process' surplus sales program .
these parts had an acquisition value of over $2.3 billion .
this report addresses whether ( 1 ) dod destroyed usable aircraft parts during the disposal process that did not have military technology and flight safety implications and ( 2 ) the military services recalled aircraft parts from the disposal process to preclude unnecessary purchases or repairs .
we will report separately on whether dod properly destroyed aircraft parts with military technology and safety implications .
as requested , we reviewed selected aspects of the department of defense's ( dod ) disposal process .
when the military services no longer need aircraft parts , they turn them over to the defense logistics agency , which manages dod's disposal process .
also , if for some reason a military service later determines there is a new need for parts still in the disposal process , it can request their return .
as one option within the disposal process , the agency can either sell the parts intact to the public or destroy the parts and sell them as scrap .
these offices handle some of the largest volumes of surplus aircraft parts within the disposal process .
our review focused on a judgmentally selected sample of 271 surplus items at three disposal offices .
the scope and methodology of our work are described in appendix i .
the parts were destroyed because ( 1 ) the military services improperly coded parts without military technology as having military technology implications and ( 2 ) policies and practices intended to prevent an inadvertent sale of military technology or flight safety items did not adequately exclude parts without military technology or flight safety implications .
drmos , consistent with legislative requirements , have disposition priorities to make the excess parts available for reutilization within dod or transfer to other federal agencies .
surplus aircraft parts can generally be divided into four categories of condition: ( 1 ) new ; ( 2 ) worn , but still working ; ( 3 ) broken , but repairable ; and ( 4 ) scrap .
until dod improves the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes , adopts better management policies and practices , and moves to use private sector techniques , such as identifying highly marketable parts , some usable parts will be unnecessarily destroyed during the disposal process .
the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 , as amended ( 40 u.s.c .
because of concerns about safeguarding military technology and maintaining flight safety , dod has specific policies and procedures relating to the disposal of aircraft parts .
dod could have avoided destroying certain usable aircraft parts that were in the disposal process .
parts that remain are designated as surplus and can be donated to eligible entities such as state and local governments , among many others .
the complexity of dod's disposal process is characterized by the massive volumes of surplus property .
dod has had problems with the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes for many years .
after these priorities have been served , parts that remain may be sold to the general public .
