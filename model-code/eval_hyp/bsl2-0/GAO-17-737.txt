state works with the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s .
the department of state's ( state ) bureau of population , refugees , and migration ( prm ) manages the process by which refugees seek to be resettled in the united states , which is known as the united states refugee admissions program ( usrap ) .
citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) , which has responsibility for adjudicating applications from these individuals .
in fiscal year 2016 , the united states admitted nearly 85,000 refugees for resettlement , the largest yearly number in more than 15 years .
state officials told us that these cases are usually uncovered before any significant consequences occurred ; however , these incidents of staff fraud in usrap have created concerns about the integrity of the program .
at the end of 2015 , unhcr reported approximately 21.3 million refugees worldwide .
federal agencies within and outside of the intelligence community , including the national counterterrorism center and the federal bureau of investigation , partner with state and uscis on security checks to identify and vet any potential national security concerns associated with an applicant .
this report ( 1 ) describes how state works with unhcr to ensure program integrity in the resettlement referral process and ( 2 ) examines the extent to which state and rscs follow leading practices to reduce the risk of fraud committed by rsc staff .
according to state officials , incidents of staff fraud occur infrequently , but there have been some cases of fraud committed by rsc staff .
further , dhs's u.s. customs and border protection is responsible for examining all individuals , including refugees , at u.s. ports of entry to determine their admissibility , and the terms and conditions on such admission , to the united states .
both state and uscis coordinate with nine resettlement support centers ( rsc ) worldwide to manage referrals and applications to usrap , collect information on each refugee applicant , and prepare approved refugee applicants for resettlement to the united states .
usrap relies on the integrity of several processes , including refugee registration , resettlement referrals , rsc preparation of applications for refugee status , and the adjudication of applications for refugee classification by uscis , to help meet u.s. resettlement goals while also safeguarding against fraud .
therefore , this report omits sensitive information about state staffing levels , rscs' reported compliance with some measures contained in state's program integrity guidelines , and actions taken by specific rscs to assess risk .
state oversees these rscs , four of which are operated by the international organization for migration ( iom ) , and four of which are operated by nongovernmental organizations ( ngo ) .
the departments of state and homeland security deemed some of the information in our june report to be sensitive , which must be protected from public disclosure .
pursuant to a provision in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , and congressional requests , we conducted a review of the refugee screening process .
state receives applications and referrals for refugee resettlement from a variety of sources , with most coming from unhcr .
if determined to have a well - founded fear of persecution on account of their race , religion , nationality , political opinion , or their membership in a particular social group , these individuals can be registered as refugees with the governments of the countries to which they have fled or with the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) .
