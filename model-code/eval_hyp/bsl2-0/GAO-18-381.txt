this report examines ( 1 ) how agencies estimate both the burden hours and costs of their information collections , and any limitations of their approaches ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies consult with and receive comments from the public on the collections' estimated burden .
overall , based on government - wide estimates , the public spent about 9.8 billion hours responding to federal information collections in fiscal year 2015 .
according to omb guidance implementing the executive order , meaningful burden reduction through the repeal or streamlining of mandatory paperwork requirements qualifies as savings that can be used to offset new regulations .
reliable , publicly informed burden estimates are essential to assist federal agencies to minimize the burden and maximize the utility of their information collections , and to effectively measure agencies' progress toward burden reduction goals .
the executive order also required that for fiscal year 2017 , the total cost of all new regulations , including the savings for regulations that have been repealed , must be zero or less , unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the director of the office of management and budget ( omb ) .
we selected irs , which is responsible for the majority of the federal government's burden hours , and the three departments with the next highest percentages of the federal government's total information collection burden hours: the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) , agriculture ( usda ) , and transportation ( dot ) .
to accomplish this , the act requires agencies to ( 1 ) justify , or describe the necessity , of the information collected ; ( 2 ) provide estimates of the burden they will impose ( i.e. , the time and costs required to comply with the collection ) ; and ( 3 ) publish notices in the federal register and otherwise consult with the public to obtain input .
executive order 13771 required executive agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed whenever they publicly propose or otherwise promulgate a new regulation , unless prohibited by law .
the primary goal of the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) is to minimize the burden of these collections on the public and maximize their utility .
to address both of these objectives , we selected four agencies as case studies based on omb data of federal information collection requests ( icr ) available on reginfo.gov as of april 7 , 2017 .
for example , the internal revenue service ( irs ) collects information from individuals and businesses to help taxpayers meet their tax responsibilities and help irs enforce the law with integrity and fairness .
you asked us to review the methodologies agencies used to estimate burden and the steps agencies take to obtain input on their information requests .
together , the four selected agencies represent more than 85 percent of the total estimated burden hours across the federal government .
for each of these four agencies , we selected the 50 largest information collections based on total burden hours ( for a total of 200 information collections ) to obtain information about estimated burden hours and resource costs , and the agencies' efforts to consult with the public .
