the nclba was signed into law on january 8 , 2002 , and will expire at the end of fy2008 ( including the automatic general education provisions act one - year extension ) .
states then competitively award grants to eligible local educational agencies ( leas ) .
it is expected that the 110 th congress will consider legislation to extend the authorization of the esea as amended by the nclba .
the reading first program was authorized as part of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) through the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ) .
the reading first program includes both formula grants ( states are allocated funds in proportion to the estimated number of children , aged 5 to 17 , who reside within the state from families with incomes below the poverty line ) and targeted assistance grants to states .
for the first two years of the program , 100% of funds , after national reservations , was allocated to states as formula grants .
the nclba also reauthorized the william f. goodling even start family literacy programs .
the nclba included three new reading programs: reading first , early reading first , and improving literacy through school libraries .
leas that receive reading first grants shall use those funds for the following purposes: selecting and administering screening , diagnostic , and classroom - based instructional reading assessments ; selecting and implementing a learning system or program of reading instruction based on scientifically based reading research that includes the essential components of reading instruction ; procuring and implementing classroom instructional materials based on scientifically based reading research ; providing professional development for teachers of grades k - 3 , and special education teachers of grades k - 12 ; collecting and summarizing data to document the effectiveness of these programs ; and accelerating improvement of reading instruction by identifying successful schools ; reporting student progress by detailed demographic characteristics ; and promoting reading and library programs that provide access to stimulating reading material .
leas may use reading first funds for the prime time family reading time program ; for training parents and other volunteers as reading tutors ; and for assisting parents to encourage and provide support for their child's reading development .
reading first was drafted with the intent of incorporating scientifically based research on what works in teaching reading to improve and expand k - 3 reading programs to address concerns about student reading achievement and to reach children at younger ages .
this report focuses on the reading first program .
for example , rcts typically do not assess how and why impacts occur , how a program might be modified to improve program results , or a program's cost - effectiveness .
many of these kinds of questions have been considered to be more appropriately addressed with observational or qualitative designs .
rcts also typically do not provide a full picture of whether unintended consequences may have resulted from a program or indicate whether a study is using valid measures or concepts for judging a program's success .
a crs report analyzing rcts included a summary of some of the potential limitations of putting too much emphasis on rcts: ... rcts are occasionally seen as impractical , unethical , requiring too much time , or being too costly compared to other designs that also seek to assess whether a program causes favorable outcomes .
