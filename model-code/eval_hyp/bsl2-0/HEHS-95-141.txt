despite advances in treating cancer , some forms of cancer are often resistant to current therapies and have a very poor outcome .
about 400,000 of the 1 million americans who will develop cancer this year , however , will be cured .
based on the findings of an earlier study that suggested the drug hydrazine sulfate may improve survival for some patients with advanced cancer , the national cancer institute ( nci ) sponsored three studies of hydrazine sulfate .
all three nci - sponsored studies , however , failed to demonstrate any benefit from hydrazine sulfate .
he and other proponents of hydrazine sulfate therapy have interpreted animal studies and other data to suggest that hydrazine sulfate is incompatible with these agents .
he asserted that the nci - sponsored clinical trials did not demonstrate any benefit for hydrazine sulfate because nci's clinical investigators permitted the concurrent use of tranquilizers , barbiturates , and alcohol .
cancer takes almost 500,000 lives annually and is the second leading cause of death in the united states .
the developer of hydrazine sulfate therapy alleged in documents furnished to the subcommittee that nci compromised its studies on hydrazine sulfate .
it provides background on the trials , including information on protocol design and data management procedures .
we discussed the conduct of these trials with nci officials and investigators , food and drug administration ( fda ) officials , and proponents of hydrazine sulfate therapy to obtain their perspectives on the issues involved .
we also reviewed agency memorandums pertaining to protocol development for the hydrazine sulfate clinical trials and related correspondence .
it also discusses how nci and the trials' investigators dealt with the issue of potential incompatibility with certain agents , the extent to which patients may have received these agents , and how this issue was reported .
this report responds to your request that we provide further information about the nci - sponsored clinical trials of hydrazine sulfate .
for each of the hydrazine sulfate clinical trials , we visited the research facilities and reviewed a sample of the research records documenting patient medications , including concurrent antiemetic ( antinauseant and antivomiting ) and barbiturate medications .
to obtain information for this report , we reviewed nci's policy guidance for conducting clinical trials of investigational agents .
this allegation was echoed in the popular media .
a more detailed description of our scope and methodology is in appendix i .
nci also sponsors therapeutic drug development through the submission of investigational new drug ( ind ) applications to fda .
some proponents believed that the concurrent use of tranquilizers , barbiturates , or alcohol with hydrazine sulfate would nullify the therapeutic effect of hydrazine sulfate and cause toxicity in patients .
nci spends about 20 percent of its research budget on clinical trials .
they based their beliefs on russian and unpublished animal studies as well as some pharmacological data that they said suggested that hydrazine sulfate interacts with tranquilizing agents ( particularly tranquilizing agents classified as benzodiazepines ) , barbiturates , and alcohol .
specifically , many patients received short - term dosages of tranquilizers for antiemetic purposes .
nci , within the national institutes of health ( nih ) , public health service , department of health and human services , is the world's largest sponsor of clinical trials in cancer treatment research .
