fmcsa's oversight program — the compliance , safety , accountability ( csa ) program — is based on the safety measurement system ( sms ) , a data - driven approach for identifying motor carriers at risk of presenting a safety hazard or causing a crash .
the precision and accuracy of these scores is vital because fmcsa investigators and their state partners use sms results to focus their resources on higher risk carriers and , through interventions , help reduce the number of motor carrier crashes , injuries , and fatalities .
fmcsa's primary mission of reducing crashes , injuries , and fatalities involving large trucks and buses is critical to the safety of our nation's highways .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss oversight of the u.s. department of transportation's ( usdot ) federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) .
fmcsa has taken actions to address our recommendations related to the vetting of chameleon carriers ; however , it has not taken action to address our recommendations to better account for limitations in the csa program .
the commercial motor carrier industry is large and diverse , with more than 500,000 active motor carriers operating on u.s. roadways .
among these activities are new entrant safety audits and identification , or vetting , of “chameleon” carriers — motor carriers that have registered and been operating illegally in interstate commerce by using a new identity in an effort to disguise their former identity and evade enforcement actions issued against them by fmcsa .
to accomplish this mission , fmcsa engages in a range of activities designed to screen , identify , and target its resources toward the motor carriers that demonstrate characteristics or behaviors that increase the risk of crashing .
fmcsa currently posts most of the scores publicly on its website for use by industry stakeholders and the public.fmcsa has indicated that a future rulemaking will include some of the information used to calculate sms scores to help determine a carrier's overall fitness to operate motor vehicles .
sms uses information collected during federal and state roadside inspections and from reported crashes to calculate scores across seven categories that quantify a carrier's safety performance relative to other carriers .
in addition , our recent work on fmcsa's chameleon carrier vetting program found that using data analysis for targeting new applicants would allow fmcsa to expand its examinations of newly registered carriers to include new applicants of all types rather than just passenger and household goods carriers , using few or no additional staff resources .
my statement today presents highlights from our two recent reports on the oversight challenges fmcsa faces in identifying high risk motor carriers .
through the csa program , fmcsa can provide the agency , state safety authorities , and the industry with valuable information regarding carriers' performance on the road and reach more carriers through interventions .
in summary , our recent work on fmcsa oversight found that the establishment of the csa program and chameleon carrier vetting program are steps toward better oversight of motor carriers .
these serious challenges raise questions about whether csa is able to identify and target the carriers at highest risk for crashing in the future .
