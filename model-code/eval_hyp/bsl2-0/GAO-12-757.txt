accordingly , our objectives were to determine: ( 1 ) what common security threats and vulnerabilities affect mobile devices , ( 2 ) what security features and practices have been identified to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities , and ( 3 ) the extent to which government and private entities have been addressing the security vulnerabilities of mobile devices .
to assess common security threats and vulnerabilities as well as security controls and practices to address them , we obtained and reviewed published analyses and guidance , including databases of mobile security vulnerabilities .
we also interviewed representatives from federal agencies and private companies with responsibilities in the telecommunications and cybersecurity fields to obtain current information about threats and vulnerabilities .
dramatic recent advances in the technical capabilities of mobile devices have paved the way for increased connectivity .
to determine the extent to which the government and private entities are addressing vulnerabilities , we analyzed statutes , regulations , agency policies , and technical standards .
given the extent of consumer reliance on mobile interactions , it is increasingly important that these devices be secured from threats to the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of the information they maintain and share .
we also interviewed officials from federal agencies and private companies to identify actions taken to address mobile security , such as developing guidance and sharing information .
although fcc has taken steps to work with industry to develop cybersecurity best practices , it has not yet taken steps to encourage wireless carriers and device manufacturers to implement a more complete industry baseline of mobile security safeguards , and nist and dhs have not determined whether consumer awareness of mobile security issues has improved since the government's efforts have been initiated .
as a result , consumers can now carry out a broad range of interactions , including sensitive transactions , which previously required the use of a desktop or laptop computer .
to help mitigate vulnerabilities in mobile devices , we recommend that the chairman of the federal communications commission continue to work with wireless carriers and device manufacturers on implementing cybersecurity best practices by encouraging them to implement a complete industry baseline of mobile security safeguards based on commonly accepted security features and practices ; and monitor progress of wireless carriers and device manufacturers in achieving their milestones and time frames once an industry baseline of mobile security safeguards has been implemented .
however , security controls are not always consistently implemented on mobile devices , and it is unclear whether consumers are aware of the importance of enabling security controls on their devices and adopting recommended practices .
advances in computing technology have resulted in increased speed and storage capacity for mobile devices .
private sector entities and relevant federal agencies have taken steps to improve the security of mobile devices , including making certain controls available for consumers to use if they wish and promulgating information about recommended mobile security practices .
to determine whether the nice initiative is having a beneficial effect in enhancing consumer awareness of mobile security issues , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security in collaboration with the secretary of commerce establish a baseline measure of consumer awareness and behavior related to mobile security and develop performance measures that use the awareness baseline to assess the effectiveness of the awareness component of the nice initiative .
