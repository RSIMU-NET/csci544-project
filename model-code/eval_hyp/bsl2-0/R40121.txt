all of the services used stop loss at the beginning of operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) but only the army has consistently employed some form of stop loss over the past nine years .
while many observers tend to sympathize with those in stop loss status , others assert that every servicemember who has enlisted or reenlisted over the past several years has been made aware of the program .
stop loss is a frequently misunderstood dod force management program that retains servicemembers beyond their contractually agreed - to separation date .
today , there are nearly 8,000 soldiers in the active army , army reserve and army national guard who remain on active duty beyond their scheduled separation date as a result of stop loss .
because of the involuntary nature of this extension , some critics have referred to the program as a "backdoor draft" or "involuntary servitude" .
stop loss was initially used in the 1990-91 persian gulf war and later in bosnia and the kosovo air campaign .
they may voluntarily remain in their military component as long as they meet promotion requirements .
servicemembers who reenlist or extend beyond their initial or subsequent enlistment will also have a separation date .
there is currently no department of defense ( dod ) policy guidance such as an instruction or directive that addresses the stop loss program .
officer personnel also have an eight - year military service obligation and generally have an active duty service obligation of three to five years depending on their source of commission .
stop loss is a force management program that involuntarily extends or retains active duty enlisted servicemembers beyond their established separation date .
while officers do not have a firm separation date , they can be subject to stop loss if a voluntary resignation or retirement application has been submitted .
reserve component personnel , to include those in the irr , are subject to a call to active duty under statutory authority and have been used extensively in support of combat operations in iraq and afghanistan .
retention has been successful , annually meeting or exceeding the numerical goals .
in the case of reserve component personnel called to active duty in support of oif or oef , stop loss involuntarily continues these members on active duty throughout their scheduled mobilization .
those who decide to separate rather than reenlist are required to sign a declination statement confirming their intent but may still be retained by stop loss .
with the reserves ordered to active duty and the proclamation of a national emergency , the secretary of defense can approve implementation of programs such as stop loss .
individuals enlisting in the armed forces , active and reserve component , are contractually obligated to an eight - year service requirement called the military service obligation ( mso ) .
observers assert that requiring units to deploy with a personnel shortage of 10% or more would likely have a significant detrimental impact on unit readiness .
officers deciding to separate are required to serve the remainder of their mso in the selected reserve or irr .
as a result , stop loss only applies to officers who have an approved retirement or resignation , which can then be denied or postponed until completion of the deployment .
