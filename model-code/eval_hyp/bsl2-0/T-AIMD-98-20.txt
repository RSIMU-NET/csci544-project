we also reviewed ncua correspondence to credit unions and third - party contractors ( that provide automated systems services to many credit unions ) regarding the year 2000 problem .
according to ncua , without properly functioning systems , credit unions like other financial institutions face the potential of failure .
we reviewed examination policies , procedures , and manuals — including specific examination procedures for assessing year 2000 compliance .
to prepare for this testimony , we performed a quick overview of ncua's efforts to date to ensure that credit unions have adequately mitigated the risks associated with the year 2000 date change and compared these activities to our year 2000 assessment guide .
in performing the overview , we interviewed ncua officials responsible for examining and overseeing the safety and soundness of credit union management practices and procedures .
if the year 2000 problem is not addressed in time , credit union computer systems — which affect billions of dollars of assets and transactions — will be unable to readily process transactions or produce accurate information .
this testimony is the first in a series of reports you requested on the status of efforts by federal financial regulatory agencies to ensure that the organizations they oversee are ready to handle the year 2000 computer conversion challenge .
we are pleased to be asked to provide our views on the progress being made by the national credit union administration ( ncua ) in ensuring that automated information systems belonging to the thousands of credit unions that ncua oversees are ready for the upcoming century date change .
i will then discuss ncua's year 2000 strategy and highlight our observations with its efforts to ensure that credit unions are appropriately addressing the problem .
as requested , my testimony today will highlight the year 2000 problem's potential impact on credit unions and their systems .
finally , we interviewed officials from the credit union national association , the national association of state credit union supervisors , and the cuna mutual group ( which provides liability insurance for the credit union industry ) .
however , we are concerned with ncua's approach because ( 1 ) current agency efforts to determine industrywide compliance are behind the generally accepted schedule for achieving year 2000 compliance , and , consequently , ncua does not yet have a complete picture of where credit unions stand individually or as an industry , ( 2 ) the agency lacks a formal , documented contingency plan in case credit unions do not become compliant in time or have other problems , ( 3 ) credit union internal auditors may not be thoroughly addressing year 2000 issues as part of their work , and ( 4 ) ncua does not have enough technical capability to conduct year 2000 and other examinations in complex systems areas .
in addition , working in conjunction with other federal financial regulators , ncua developed procedures for examiners to use in reviewing credit union year 2000 efforts .
in summary , we found that the year 2000 problem poses a serious dilemma for credit unions because they like other financial institutions rely heavily on information systems .
we also found that ncua recognizes the severity of the problem , has developed a plan , and has initiated action .
