our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) how tva plans to meet future demand for electricity and how tva's resource planning and forecasts compare to plans and forecasts from other sources , ( 2 ) tva's efforts to use energy efficiency to meet demand for electricity , and ( 3 ) tva's financial condition and how it affects tva's ability to meets its operational and financial goals .
we evaluated tva's assumptions and variables for some of the underlying determinants of its power supply plan , such as capital costs of electricity generation alternatives , fuel costs , emissions - related costs , and costs of energy efficiency programs .
for example , in april 2011 , tva settled with the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , agreeing to invest $3 billion to $5 billion in the next 10 years on new and upgraded pollution controls on existing power plants , and according to the settlement , plans to invest another $350 million to reduce pollution , primarily through energy efficiency projects .
to address our first objective , we collected and reviewed pertinent tva forecasts supporting tva's most recent power supply plan , characterized tva's electricity generation portfolio , and analyzed aspects of its electricity operations and plans to meet projected electricity demand .
tva currently faces a number of financial challenges associated with environmental cleanup or protection .
you asked us to review aspects of tva's resource planning activities and financial condition , emphasizing tva's existing resource planning process in the context of its debts and financial obligations as tva seeks to make long - term energy investments .
tva is subject to a statutorily - imposed $30 billion debt ceiling imposed by the tva act of 1933 , as amended , and as of september 30 , 2010 , had about $23.6 billion in statutory debt and about $2.2 billion in alternative financial arrangements .
tva's only other source of funds for capital investments is its revenue from operations .
we compared tva's forecasts with forecasts from other sources , including the department of energy's energy information administration ( eia ) and nongovernmental sources , such as ihs global insight .
tva has also incurred more than $1 billion in cleanup costs at the site of a large coal ash spill that occurred in december 2008 at tva's kingston , tennessee , coal - fired plant .
tva has primarily financed large capital investments , such as the construction of nuclear power plants , by issuing debt in the form of bonds .
we identified these utilities based on eia data on energy efficiency program expenditures and energy saved through these programs and by consulting with industry experts and reviewing industry reports .
for example , a nuclear power plant with a single 1,100 mw reactor that could provide electricity to more than 600,000 homes can cost billions of dollars and require long lead times to obtain regulatory approval , perform engineering studies , and build the necessary infrastructure , among other things .
with more than nine million customers , a generating capacity of more than 34,000 megawatts ( mw ) , and annual electricity revenues of about $11 billion , tva is the largest publicly owned utility in the united states .
