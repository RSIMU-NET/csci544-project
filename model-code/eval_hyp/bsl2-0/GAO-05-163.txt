concerned that institutional controls may not be effectively protecting human health and the environment , you asked us to review ( 1 ) the extent to which institutional controls are used at sites addressed by epa's superfund and rcra corrective action programs ; ( 2 ) the extent to which epa ensures that institutional controls at these sites are implemented , monitored , and enforced ; and ( 3 ) epa's challenges in implementing systems to track these controls .
under the rcra program , epa has authorized 40 states and guam to implement and enforce their own hazardous waste regulations in lieu of federal regulations and to carry out corrective action activities .
the cleanup process for the superfund and rcra programs is similar in many ways .
within the superfund program , states may enter into agreements with epa to perform certain program actions , such as initial site assessments , and epa also consults with states throughout the cleanup process .
in addition , at certain superfund and rcra sites , state and local government entities may be responsible for monitoring the status of institutional controls and enforcing their terms .
although both the superfund and rcra programs address federal and nonfederal sites , our review did not address federal sites because federal agencies are generally responsible for cleaning up their own sites and epa involvement is limited .
states play a significant role in the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under both the superfund and rcra programs .
to protect the public's health , the congress passed the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) of 1980 , which established the superfund program to clean up the most seriously contaminated of these sites .
in addition , in 1984 , the congress amended the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) to add a corrective action program to clean up contamination at facilities that treat , store , and dispose of hazardous waste .
we also focused our reviews of rcra facilities on those whose cleanup was led by epa .
as of december 2004 , about 1,600 hazardous waste sites were being cleaned up by the superfund program and another 3,800 facilities were being cleaned up by the rcra corrective action program .
in this initial phase , under superfund , epa places the most seriously contaminated sites on its national priorities list ( npl ) .
however , regardless of whether a particular state is authorized , either the state or epa may assume the lead on working with a facility to implement corrective action .
to address these issues , we examined epa's use , implementation , monitoring , and enforcement of institutional controls at a nonprobability sample of nonfederal sites where ( 1 ) the cleanup process was completed in earlier periods , for historical perspective ; ( 2 ) the cleanup process had ended more recently ; and ( 3 ) the remedy had only recently been selected , for insight into the likely future use of these controls .
since the inception of these two programs , epa has overseen the cleanup of over 5,000 hazardous waste sites across the country .
cleanups at such sites often rely on institutional controls — legal or administrative restrictions on the use of land or water at the site — to limit the public's exposure to residual contamination .
