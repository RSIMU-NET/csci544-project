even modest progress in reducing the tax gap would yield significant revenue ; each 1 percent reduction would likely yield nearly $3 billion annually .
consequently , continued performance improvements will depend on the extent to which irs can make more efficient use of limited resources to provide internal funding for the improvements .
if its 2007 budget request is a harbinger of longer term funding , irs faces an era of tight budgets .
to address your request , we assessed ( 1 ) the interim results of irs's 2006 filing season performance compared to prior years ; ( 2 ) irs's budget request compared to prior years ; and ( 3 ) how the budget helps irs achieve its long - term goals aimed at reducing the tax gap .
after late payments by taxpayers and revenue brought in by irs's enforcement efforts , the resulting net tax gap is estimated to be $290 billion .
irs has also increased revenue collected through its enforcement programs ; however , tax law enforcement continues to be included on our list of high - risk federal programs .
irs estimated the gross tax gap to be $345 billion for tax year 2001 .
increased funding financed some of the improvements , but a significant portion has been financed internally through efficiencies from increased electronic filing of tax returns and other operational improvements .
our statement discusses irs's 2006 filing season performance to date and fiscal year 2007 budget request .
by indicating how resources are allocated to specific programs and activities within the agency , the budget request is a key planning tool showing where the agency intends to achieve additional efficiencies .
the 2007 budget request is also an indication of how irs intends to achieve longer term goals .
this budget can be viewed as a first step in a series of annual steps that will determine whether irs achieves these long - term goals .
since the passage of the internal revenue service ( irs ) restructuring and reform act of 1998 ( rra 98 ) , irs has made noticeable improvements to taxpayer services such as telephone assistance and delivered some modernized information systems that , among other benefits , speed up refunds to taxpayers .
our assessment of the budget request is based on a comparative analysis of irs's fiscal year 2002 ( in most cases ) through 2007 budget requests , funding , expenditures , and other documentation and interviews with irs officials .
for the first time , irs lists two agencywide long - term goals: to increase the compliance rate and reduce the proportion of taxpayers who think it is acceptable to cheat on their taxes .
our assessment of the interim results of irs's filing season is based on comparing irs's performance this year to prior filing seasons , monitoring various production meetings and production statistics , reviewing other irs documents and reports , interviewing irs and treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) officials and paid tax preparers and other external stakeholders , reviewing tigta and other external reports , and reviewing irs's web site .
although information reporting is highly effective in encouraging compliance , such reporting imposes costs and burdens on the businesses that implement it .
