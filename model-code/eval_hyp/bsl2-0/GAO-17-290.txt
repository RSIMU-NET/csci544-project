to help ensure that payments are made properly , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within hhs that administers the medicare program , contracts with medicare administrative contractors ( mac ) .
macs — in addition to processing and paying medicare claims — conduct education efforts intended to improve billing practices for the medicare program .
these efforts are in addition to cms's own education for providers on proper billing .
macs' provider outreach and education ( which we hereafter refer to as provider education ) departments play a significant role in these efforts .
to examine macs' provider education department efforts to reduce improper billing and the extent to which cms oversees these efforts , we reviewed the first annual mac improper payment reduction strategy ( iprs ) report for the 8 macs that had contracts as of july 1 , 2016 .
these reports are intended to identify risks to medicare and describe the planned interventions meant to ensure proper payments and address these risks .
certain services in the medicare fee - for - service program had higher improper payment rates , such as home health services , which had an estimated improper payment rate of 42 percent and represented an estimated $7.7 billion in improper payments , also as reported in fiscal year 2016 .
in fiscal year 2016 , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) reported that an estimated 11 percent of the payments made to health care providers under the medicare fee - for - service program were made improperly , representing $41.1 billion in improper payments .
improper payments include payments made in error , such as payments that should not have been made ; payments made in incorrect amounts , including overpayments and underpayments ; and payments for claims that were not properly documented .
this report examines the focus of macs' provider education department efforts to help reduce improper billing and the extent to which cms oversees these efforts , and the extent to which cms measured the effectiveness of the mac probe and educate reviews in reducing improper billing .
however , cms has missed opportunities to improve the effectiveness and its oversight of those efforts .
we also reviewed relevant federal standards for internal control related to risk assessment and monitoring .
to ensure macs' provider education efforts are focused on areas vulnerable to improper billing and to strengthen cms's oversight of those efforts , we recommend that cms take the following three actions: 1 .
insufficient documentation — one type of improper billing — was the most common source of improper payments in medicare fee - for service , causing 65.2 percent of all improper payments in the same year .
macs also conduct probe and educate reviews as part of a cms strategy to determine the extent to which providers understand recent policy changes for certain areas vulnerable to improper billing as identified by cms and to help providers improve billing in these areas .
given longstanding concerns about medicare improper payments , you asked us to provide information about macs' provider education department efforts and the results of the macs' probe and educate reviews .
according to cms , the fundamental goal of the provider education departments is to reduce the rate of improper payments by giving medicare providers the information they need to understand the medicare program , such as coverage and payment rules , and bill properly .
