the senate report and subsequent conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2004 military construction appropriation bill directed dod to prepare detailed , comprehensive master plans to ensure that infrastructure requirements at u.s. military facilities in each overseas regional command's area of responsibility reflected dod's global realignment of u.s. forces and installations .
realigning the u.s. overseas posture involves closing obsolete and redundant bases , constructing new facilities costing billions of dollars , and ensuring that other needed infrastructure is in place to support realigned forces and missions .
for example , the u.s. - japan defense policy review initiative established a framework for u.s. force structure in japan that relocates u.s. military units from japan to other areas , including guam .
in its ongoing global realignment of u.s. forces and installations , the department of defense ( dod ) plans to reduce the number of troops permanently stationed overseas and consolidate overseas bases .
the senate report also directed us to provide assessment reports on these master plans each year to the congressional defense committees .
as a part of this initiative , dod tentatively plans to move about 8,000 marines and their estimated 9,000 dependents from okinawa , japan , to guam by 2014 .
this report examines ( 1 ) the changes and challenges described in this year's overseas master plans , the extent to which they address our prior recommendations , and the plans' timeliness and ( 2 ) the status of dod's master planning efforts for the proposed buildup of military forces and infrastructure on guam .
in july 2006 , the senate report accompanying the fiscal year 2007 military construction appropriation bill directed dod to submit a master plan for the military buildup in guam by december 29 , 2006 .
the senate report accompanying the fiscal year 2007 military construction appropriation bill also directed us to review dod's master planning effort for guam as part of our annual review of the overseas master plans .
this is our fifth report responding to the requirements contained in the fiscal year 2004 senate military construction appropriation bill report and our second report responding to the reporting requirements on the guam military buildup contained in the fiscal year 2007 senate military construction appropriation bill report .
subsequently , the conference report accompanying the 2004 military construction appropriation bill also directed the department to prepare comprehensive master plans with yearly updates through fiscal year 2009 .
forces japan ; u.s. european command ; and u.s. central command .
the fiscal year 2009 master plans generally reflect recent changes in the u.s. overseas defense basing strategies and requirements and current challenges that dod faces in implementation .
forces korea and u.s .
we assessed whether the fiscal year 2009 plans were in compliance with the office of the secretary of defense's ( osd ) most recent guidance on overseas master plans .
dod considers the master plan for guam as separate from the overseas master plans because guam is a u.s. territory .
we generally concluded that the master plans addressed the congressional reporting requirements if the plans included details on base categories ( i.e. , military population on main operating bases , forward operating sites , and cooperative security locations ) , host nation funding levels , facility requirements and costs , environmental remediation issues , and other challenges affecting implementation of the plans .
