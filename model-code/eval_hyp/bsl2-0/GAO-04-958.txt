the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act of 2000 ( eeoicpa ) , enacted as title xxxvi of public law 106-398 of the floyd d. spence national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 , was signed into law on october 30 , 2000 .
several different federal agencies are involved with the implementation of the subtitle b program , including labor , the centers for disease control and prevention's ( cdc ) national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , and energy .
while most of the concerns about eeoicpa have focused on energy's implementation of subtitle d , concerns have also been raised about subtitle b claims , such as the length of time involved in completing dose reconstructions .
we focused our work on two key areas: ( 1 ) how well labor's procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are not referred to niosh for dose reconstruction but are being processed by labor and ( 2 ) how well labor's and niosh's procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are referred for dose reconstructions .
for the last several decades , the department of energy ( energy ) and its predecessor agencies and contractors have employed thousands of individuals in secret and dangerous work in the nuclear weapons production complex .
eeoicpa established two programs to help secure compensation for certain workers who developed occupational illnesses or for their survivors .
over the years , employees were unknowingly exposed to toxic substances , including radioactive and hazardous materials , and studies have shown that many of these employees subsequently developed serious illnesses .
the first program , established by subtitle b , is administered by the department of labor ( labor ) .
living and eligible energy employees also receive coverage for future medical expenses related to the illness .
finally , energy provides employment and radiation records , where available , to labor and niosh as appropriate .
compensation of $50,000 and payment of medical expenses from the date a claim is filed is also available for employees exposed to uranium previously awarded benefits by the department of justice under section 5 of the radiation exposure compensation act ( reca ) .
this program allows energy to help its employees file state workers' compensation claims for illnesses determined by a panel of physicians to be caused by exposure during employment at an energy facility .
labor has primary responsibility for administering the program ; labor receives the claims and determines whether the claimant meets the eligibility requirements .
the second program , established by subtitle d , is administered by energy .
under this program , eligible workers who were exposed to radiation or toxic substances and who subsequently developed specific kinds of cancers and other named conditions , or their survivors , receive a onetime total payment of $150,000 .
also , we obtained information on niosh's efforts to complete site profiles needed to assist with the dose reconstruction process and on a recently introduced regulation for considering special exposure cohort petitions .
we also interviewed officials from labor's office of workers' compensation programs and its four district offices as well as niosh's office of compensation analysis and support .
