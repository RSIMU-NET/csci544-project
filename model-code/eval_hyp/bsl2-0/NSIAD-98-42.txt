in response to your request , this report discusses ( 1 ) the department of defense's ( dod ) and the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) requirements for surveillance of space objects and ( 2 ) dod's space surveillance capabilities to support these requirements .
this report contains recommendations to the secretary of defense and the administrator of nasa .
we are sending copies of this report to the secretaries of defense , the air force , the navy , and the army ; the administrator of nasa ; the directors of the office of management and budget , the office of science and technology policy , and the central intelligence ; and other interested congressional committees .
copies will be made available to others upon request .
major contributors to this report are listed in appendix iv .
nasa relies on dod for space surveillance support , and both agencies need improved surveillance capabilities .
if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report , please call me at ( 202 ) 512-4841 .
dod's space surveillance requirements are under review and are likely to become more stringent .
we evaluated ( 1 ) how well dod's existing space surveillance capabilities support dod's and nasa's current and future surveillance requirements and ( 2 ) the extent to which potential space surveillance capabilities and technologies are coordinated to provide opportunities for improvements .
because dod's existing space surveillance network cannot satisfy its and nasa's emerging requirements , changes in the network may be needed .
despite this dependency relationship , the policy makes no provision for an interagency mechanism — either organizational or funding — to ensure that dod's space surveillance capabilities meet nasa's requirements .
nasa and dod have held discussions over the years regarding nasa's surveillance requirements , but there is no authoritative direction , formal agreement , or clear plan on how the two agencies could consolidate their requirements for a common capability .
however , four dod systems that could provide such capabilities — the naval space surveillance system , sbirs - low , gbr , and thaad — lack sufficient coordination , both within dod and between dod and nasa .
from a national security ( defense and intelligence ) perspective , space surveillance provides ( 1 ) warning to u.s. forces when a foreign satellite becomes a threat to military operations and ( 2 ) information to support responsive measures .
dod has acknowledged that its existing surveillance network is aging , requires replacement or upgrades in the next 10 to 15 years , and is currently limited in its ability to detect and track objects smaller than 30 centimeters .
although nearly all of these objects are thought to be smaller than 1 centimeter , about 110,000 are estimated to be between 1 and 10 centimeters , and about 8,000 are larger than 10 centimeters .
since the former soviet union launched its first sputnik satellite 40 years ago , the number of manmade space objects orbiting the earth — active and inactive satellites and debris generated from launch vehicle and satellite breakups — has increased dramatically .
to accomplish these objectives , we reviewed surveillance network studies ; dod's and nasa's surveillance requirements documents and emerging needs ; reports , plans , and budgets associated with surveillance network operations , maintenance , and enhancements ; and program documentation on potential capabilities .
