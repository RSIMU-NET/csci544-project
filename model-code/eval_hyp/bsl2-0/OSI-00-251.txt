we are making recommendations designed to assist hcfa in its efforts to further enhance its ability to measure the extent of losses emanating from medicare fee - for - service payments .
given the importance of medicare to millions of beneficiaries and concerns about the financial health of the program , you asked us to provide suggested improvements to assist hcfa in its efforts to further estimate medicare improper payments , including potential fraud and abuse .
accomplishing this goal will depend , in part , on hcfa's ability to further develop improper payment measures to enable it to more effectively target specific corrective actions .
identifying the extent of improper payments and their causes , including those attributable to potential fraud and abuse , are the first steps toward implementing the most cost - effective ways to reduce losses .
in response to this need , hcfa has begun three projects intended to enhance its understanding of improper payments and help it develop targeted corrective actions .
although we believe hcfa's efforts to measure medicare fee - for - service improper payments can be further enhanced with the use of additional fraud detection techniques , we support the efforts they have taken thus far .
to demonstrate a commitment to improving payment safeguards , in january 2000 , hcfa reaffirmed its goal of reducing the medicare fee - for - service payment errors to 5 percent or less by the year 2002 , about a 3 percent or $5 billion reduction from fiscal year 1999 levels .
however , without additional information on the extent of improper paymentsattributable to potential fraud and abuse , hcfa's ability to fully measure the success of its efforts remains limited .
hcfa , an operating division within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , has designated ensuring the integrity of the medicare program a top priority .
in summary , we concluded that because it was not intended to include procedures designed specifically to identify all types of potential fraudulent and abusive activity , the current methodology does not provide an estimate of the full extent of improper medicare fee - for - service payments ; hcfa has initiated three projects designed to further its measurement efforts which offer some promise for determining the extent of improper payments attributable to potential fraud and abuse ; and based on careful evaluation of their effectiveness , performing additional potential fraud identification techniques as part of its efforts to measure improper payments could assist hcfa in arriving at a more comprehensive measurement and , ultimately , develop cost - effective internal controls to combat improper payments ; however , no set of techniques , no matter how extensive , can be expected to measure all potential fraud and abuse .
it recognizes that inappropriate payments are a drain on the program's financial resources â€” resources intended to provide essential health care services to millions of elderly and disabled americans .
results from the most recent study indicate that , of the $164 billion in fiscal year 1999 medicare fee - for - service claim payments , a projected $13.5 billion were paid improperly for various reasons ranging from inadvertent errors to outright fraud and abuse .
the magnitude of these estimated losses has led to considerable concern regarding hcfa's efforts to protect medicare dollars as well as the need to obtain a better understanding of the nature and extent of the problems .
