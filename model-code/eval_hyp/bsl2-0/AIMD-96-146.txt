you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the nature of problems that may have occurred in reporting currency activity for federal reserve note receipts , payments , and amount on hand and ( 2 ) review and comment on corrective actions planned or taken by the federal reserve to resolve those problems .
we focused on the reports for the months of october through december 1995 because those had been identified by your staff and the federal reserve as months in which the reports were prepared incorrectly .
you expressed concern that management at the l.a. bank had directed staff to report inaccurate numbers in such reports to ensure that they balanced with other reports generated from the bank's accounting data base .
this letter responds to your request that we review reports on currency activities prepared for the federal reserve board of governors by the los angeles federal reserve bank , a branch bank of the san francisco district bank .
each of the 37 banks ( 12 district and 25 branches ) in the federal reserve system prepares monthly currency activity reports , known as the fr 160 reports .
further , we did not perform a review of ( 1 ) the l.a. bank's computer security controls for preventing unauthorized access to its general ledger and cash inventory system or ( 2 ) its physical access controls for ensuring that the money it manages is protected from theft and misappropriation .
these reports and the underlying systems that they are generated from constitute the federal reserve's only detailed records of currency transactions throughout the federal reserve system and the respective ending balances by denomination .
thus , information on monthly currency movement in and out of federal reserve banks provided to federal reserve management ( including the board of governors ) , the congress , and other external users of this information would be based on data from the monthly currency activity reports .
to accomplish this , we ( 1 ) reviewed the l.a .
the objectives of our review at the l.a. bank were to determine the nature of the problems that may have occurred in reporting currency activity for federal reserve note receipts , payments , and amount on hand and review and comment on corrective actions planned or taken by the federal reserve to resolve those problems .
in the third part of our review , we interviewed bank officials and reviewed the new procedures for preparing the currency activity reports and the revised reports to determine if their efforts to comply with their policy for preparing these reports were effective in resolving the problems identified .
however , our efforts were restricted by the lack of readily available historical data maintained by the l.a. bank .
the monthly currency activity reports are transmitted to the board of governors to document movement of currency through the banks and to summarize the total currency on hand in the respective banks' vaults .
we gathered information on bank procedures for resolving out - of - balance situations and differences between amounts reported and actually received from banks .
these reconciliations compare the bank's general ledger balances ( which are used to prepare the daily balance sheet ) to its cash inventory system ( which contains the physical inventory file ) .
