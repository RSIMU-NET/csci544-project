this report focuses on medicare beneficiaries' access to prescription drugs by examining: ( 1 ) the importance of assets and income in lis denials in 2006 and 2007 ; and ( 2 ) state and drug manufacturer programs providing access to prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries .
in addition to the part d lis , some state and drug manufacturer programs provide prescription drug assistance to medicare beneficiaries with low incomes .
to help further defray the costs of prescription drugs for beneficiaries with limited financial means , the mma included a provision for a low - income subsidy ( lis ) .
the social security administration ( ssa ) administers the lis eligibility - determination process , notifying cms whether an individual applicant has been approved for the lis or denied it .
 ( for 2008 , the income threshold for the lis is $15,600 for individuals and $21,000 for couples ; the asset threshold is $11,990 for individuals and $23,970 for couples. ) .
under this program , which began in january 2006 , medicare beneficiaries can enroll in prescription drug plans run by private companies that contract with the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers the medicare program .
the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) created a voluntary outpatient prescription drug insurance program , known as medicare part d , that provides prescription drug coverage for over 25 million beneficiaries — seniors and individuals with disabilities — enrolled in the program .
the part d program shares the cost of these drug plans with enrollees .
through the lis , medicare assists these beneficiaries with their out - of - pocket prescription drug expenses , with the amount of assistance depending on beneficiaries' income and assets .
to qualify for the lis , applicants must meet two conditions: ( 1 ) their income and assets must be less than the thresholds established by the mma ; and ( 2 ) they must be enrolled in a part d plan .
prior to the enactment of the mma , there was considerable discussion among policymakers about the appropriateness of using an asset test ( in addition to an income test ) to determine eligibility for the lis .
our analysis is limited to lis applicants ; individuals deemed eligible for the lis — dual eligibles and supplemental security income ( ssi ) recipients — are not within our scope because they do not have to apply for it .
to examine potential access to other sources of assistance with prescription drug costs , we reviewed literature on state programs and the requirements of these programs .
following these discussions , the mma directed us to compare the utilization of and access to part d drugs among beneficiaries who received the lis with those denied it because of the amount of their assets .
some contended that an income test alone was sufficient to identify those who needed the lis and that an asset test would prevent seniors who needed assistance from qualifying for it .
we will address this mandate in two reports .
