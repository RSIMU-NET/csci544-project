although dod recognizes these problems , it has made only limited progress in adopting solutions .
fundamentally , dod has not ( 1 ) acknowledged or adequately addressed the criticality of software to systems' operational requirements early enough in the acquisition process ; ( 2 ) developed , implemented , or standardized decision - making tools and processes ( e.g. , metrics ) to help measure or project weapon system software cost , schedule , and performance risk ; ( 3 ) developed test and evaluation policy that provides specific guidance regarding software maturity ; and ( 4 ) adequately defined and managed requirements for its increasingly complex software ( see ch .
major contributors to this report are listed in appendix iv .
these significant factors increase the overall costs of software .
accordingly , software quality has become a primary concern in emerging defense acquisition programs , including weapon systems ; automated information systems ; and command , control , communications , and intelligence systems .

although the department of defense ( dod ) does not know precisely how much it spends on software , the defense systems management college projected that dod would spend about $36.2 billion for software in 1992 .
dod estimates that about 30 percent of its software life - cycle expenditures are for initial development and 70 percent are for post - deployment software support , that is , maintaining , upgrading , and modifying existing software to correct deficiencies , respond to mission changes , or enhance technology .
1.1. ) .
the congress and senior dod officials have long been concerned with dod's inability to field software - intensive defense acquisition programs on time and within budget .
because computer software controls most functions of modern defense systems , the systems' performance depends largely on the quality of that complex and increasingly costly software .
3 ) .
according to the dod inspector general , the costs of computer hardware components integral to weapon systems and other critical military and intelligence systems , are expected to remain stable at about $6 billion annually between 1990 and 1995 , whereas corresponding software costs are expected to grow from about $30 billion to $42 billion .
