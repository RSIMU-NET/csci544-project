congress has demonstrated its keen interest in promoting the use of telework in the federal government by establishing a wide - ranging statutory framework .
this framework has included provisions directed at increasing employee eligibility for telework , requiring reporting and evaluation of telework implementation , establishing agency telework coordinators to lead the program , setting goals for the application of telework provisions to the federal workforce , and even withholding funds from some agencies that fail to show progress .
it is increasingly recognized as an important means to achieving a number of federal efforts , including effective strategic human capital management of the federal workforce , and a greater capability to continue operations during emergency events , as well as affording environmental , energy , and other benefits to society .
s. 1000 is intended to advance this framework and the implementation of telework programs and to increase the eligibility of federal employees for telework as well as its use .
we will also share observations from our past work that relate to agency telework methodologies , as well as our views of the specific legislation under consideration .
and finally , we will offer some suggested next steps to advance the purposes of the bill .
telework is a human capital strategy which offers flexibilities to both employers and employees .
my comments are based on previously issued gao reports that were developed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
my statement today will describe first the statutory framework that drives the agency telework programs and processes .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our observations of federal telework policies based on our past work and to provide additional observations that relate to the provisions of s. 1000 , the telework enhancement act of 2007 .
some legislative actions have provided for funding to assist agencies in implementing programs , while other appropriations acts withheld appropriated funds until the covered agencies certified that telecommuting opportunities were made available to 100 percent of each agency's eligible workforce .
the telework enhancement act of 2007 , s. 1000 , continues the efforts of congress to achieve greater participation .
through a number of legislative actions , congress has indicated its desire that agencies create telework programs to accomplish a number of positive outcomes .
the bill would extend coverage of these telework initiatives to the legislative and judicial branches .
these actions have included recognizing the need for program leadership within the agencies ; encouraging agencies to think broadly in setting eligibility requirements ; requiring that employees be allowed , if eligible , to participate in telework , and requiring tracking and reporting of program results .
the most significant congressional action related to telework was the enactment of section 359 of public law no .
as we have discussed with your staff , we have specific concerns about section 5 of the bill , which would require gao to establish and implement a rating system for agency compliance with and participation in telework initiatives and report the results .
the bill further recognizes the importance of leadership in promoting an agency's telework program by requiring the appointment of a senior - level management official to perform several functions to promote and enhance telework opportunities .
