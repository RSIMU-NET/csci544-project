dod's initial total cost estimate for sbr is about $28.6 billion from fiscal year 2003 to 2024 .
with achievable requirements and commitment of sufficient investment to complete development , programs are better able to deliver products at cost and on schedule .
given sbr's overall importance to dod and the intelligence community , we reviewed the sbr program to assess dod's progress in attaining the knowledge it needs by 2006 in terms of ( 1 ) requirements and ( 2 ) resources — technology , communications infrastructure , and funding .
most space programs over the past several decades have not been able to achieve a match between needs and resources before product development and have incurred significant cost and schedule increases due in part to the need to rework technologies in the later stages of their acquisition .
this is an ambitious program for dod .
our past work has shown that successful weapon system programs are able to match their needs to their resources — that is , money , technology , and time — before product development .
dod expects to begin product development in fiscal year 2006 ; at which point it will make a commitment to invest in a formal acquisition program for sbr .
and although the technologies for tracking moving targets from space are still in development , dod is scheduling almost 7 years between the start of product development and launch of the first sbr satellite — a time frame that is considerably shorter than what has been achieved in the past for other complex satellite systems .
dod would like to field sbr satellites as quickly as possible because it believes that sbr represents a major leap forward in providing the warfighters , intelligence community , and national decision makers with significant tactical , operational , and strategic advantages over potential adversaries .
dod also envisions that sbr will generate high - quality radar imagery of targets and terrain and interface with ground , air , and other space systems so that users can gain a better understanding of what is occurring in specific locations .
for example , dod envisions that sbr will be able to see deep inside enemy territory without risk to personnel or resources and that it will operate over areas where conventional airborne surveillance systems are at risk from the enemy's surface - to - air missiles , which can travel increasingly longer ranges .
dod is in the early exploratory phase of the sbr program — a period when it gathers knowledge about its needs , or requirements , and explores the feasibility of meeting those requirements .
the department of defense ( dod ) currently has ground - based and air - based radars but no capability to track moving targets from space .
sbr is to enhance information gathering by providing intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance data in a meaningful and timely manner .
we are addressing this report to you because of your jurisdiction over weapon systems acquisition .
we conducted our review of the sbr program on the initiative of the comptroller general .
to meet a need for persistent global observation , dod and the intelligence community are working together to develop the space - based radar ( sbr ) system to find , identify , track , and monitor ground and sea targets — mobile or immobile — under all - weather conditions and on a near - continual basis across large swaths of the earth's surface .
