it has also made a commitment to absorb certain agency transition costs .
to ensure it would have the funds necessary to pay for these costs , gsa estimated that it would need to set aside approximately $151.5 million .
this report responds to your request that we determine ( 1 ) the soundness of the analysis gsa used to derive the estimate of funding that would be required for the transition and ( 2 ) whether gsa will have accumulated adequate funding to pay for its transition management costs .
gsa will incur program management costs associated with planning and executing this transition .
as innovations in telecommunications services continue to transform the way the federal government conducts business , the general services administration's ( gsa ) governmentwide telecommunications acquisition programs offer federal agencies the opportunity to apply innovative services and solutions to their operations .
with the current set of governmentwide telecommunications contracts approaching expiration , gsa and its customer agencies will have to transition the services acquired under these contracts to their replacements , known collectively as networx .
we determined that high - quality , reliable estimates should be accurate , comprehensive , well - documented , and validated .
to accomplish the first objective , we conducted a search of over 250 documents from both government and industry for examples of best practices in the field of cost estimation and identified common characteristics among them .
using these characteristics , we analyzed transition estimate documentation developed by gsa , documentation provided by gsa on the previous transition , the networx request for proposals , and other relevant documents .
despite the weaknesses in its analysis , gsa has accumulated adequate funding to support its anticipated commitments related to the networx transition .
to accomplish the second objective , we analyzed financial and operational documents from related gsa programs .
our analysis indicates that it is highly unlikely that gsa will need more than the $142 million it has already accumulated .
in addition , we interviewed gsa program officials about both objectives and conducted an analysis of gsa's estimate to examine the effects of varying the main cost driver in the estimate .
in addition , the merger of two revolving funds gives it increased flexibility in meeting costs .
gsa has accumulated adequate funding to support its anticipated commitments related to the networx transition .
without the use of a cost estimation policy that reflects best practices , gsa could continue to produce similarly unsound estimates , increasing the risk that it will unnecessarily retain funds that could be reallocated for other purposes .
to improve gsa's program management , we are making two recommendations .
once networx contracts are awarded beginning in march 2007 , gsa will be able to forecast the number of forced transitions more accurately , and , if necessary , reduce the amount of funding it plans to accumulate in the future or free already accumulated funds for other purposes .
while an intentionally conservative approach minimizes the risk that gsa would have inadequate funds to pay for committed transition costs , it increases the risk that gsa will retain excess funds that could be used for other purposes .
this reassessment will also be an opportunity for gsa to address the other weaknesses in its analysis that resulted from its deviation from best practices .
