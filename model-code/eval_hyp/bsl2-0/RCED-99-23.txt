 ( 2 ) how might claims for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that are reported to the voluntary reporting program fare under a credit for early action program that has less flexible reporting criteria ? .
in view of the wide range of emissions reduction claims reported by organizations to the program , you expressed interest in efforts to consider granting credit to these organizations for the early actions they have taken .
a number of related events , including the president's climate change proposal of october 1997 and the united nations' framework convention on climate change in kyoto , japan , in december 1997 , also focused more attention on how greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced .
specifically , you asked the following two questions: ( 1 ) what are some of the basic issues that will have to be addressed by any effort to develop a credit for early action program ? .
doe specifically designed the program to encourage voluntary participation by offering potential participants flexibility in what they reported and how they estimated their emissions reductions .
under this program , organizations could voluntarily submit information on their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the department of energy ( doe ) and have that information entered into a public database .
one part of the president's proposal was a program to reward organizations , by providing credits or incentives , for taking early actions to reduce greenhouse gases before the international agreements from the kyoto protocol would take effect .
over the past several years , the level of attention paid to reducing greenhouse gas emissions has increased because these heat - trapping gases are believed to be contributing to global warming .
as we previously reported to you in march of this year , efforts to report reductions of greenhouse gas emissions were initiated with the establishment of the voluntary reporting program , as directed by the energy policy act of 1992 .
ii ) .
as agreed with your office , we also present other issues we identified about a credit for early action program that may need to be addressed before the program can be finalized ( see app .
the proposal is now commonly referred to as a “credit for early action” program .
to select the basic issues associated with developing a credit for early action program , we identified organizations that have been involved with the development of such a program and who have prepared informational papers on their views .
 ( 1 ) how should emissions reductions be estimated ? .
 ( 2 ) how should emissions reduction ownership be determined ? .
efforts to develop a credit for early action program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions involve consideration of many issues before such a program could be implemented .
and ( 4 ) how should emissions reduction claims be verified ? .
we reviewed these documents and interviewed available representatives from these groups .
 ( 3 ) should the emissions reduction claims be reported at the organization , project , or some other level ? .
while these issues appear straightforward , in fact , they are complicated and will require difficult choices .
we identified four issues , stated here as questions , that will have to be addressed in developing a credit for early action program .
