ssns were originally created to track workers' employment history and eligibility for social security benefits .
the agency also issued over 2 million replacement cards to u.s. - born children .
the social security administration ( ssa ) refers to the assignment of original ssns and replacement ssn cards as “enumeration.” in fiscal year 2004 , ssa issued over 4 million original ssns to u.s. - born children , of which over 90 percent were to children under age 1 .
because of increasing concerns regarding the enumeration of children , the chairman of the senate finance committee requested that we ( 1 ) document current processes and internal controls for issuing ssns to u.s. - born children under the age of 18 and ( 2 ) identify any weaknesses that may affect ssa's ability to ensure the integrity of the ssn and the efficiency of enumeration processes .
however , today , ssns are used for a myriad of purposes , and even children born as u.s. citizens must have ssns to be claimed as dependents on their parents' tax returns and to receive benefits from federal programs .
because ssns are central to so many aspects of american life , children's ssns , like all ssns , are vulnerable to fraud and financial crimes .
today , the majority of children born in the united states are assigned a social security number ( ssn ) before their first birthday .
we also documented the roles of select hospitals and vital statistics agencies , which facilitate ssa's process for enumerating newborns .
to complete our work , we examined ssa's program operations manual system and met with ssa officials to identify the processes used to enumerate children .
to identify weaknesses that may affect ssa's ability to efficiently enumerate children and ensure the integrity of the ssn , we collected and analyzed information on ssa's enumeration initiatives , the results of prior internal reviews , and studies performed by ssa's office of the inspector general ( oig ) and office of quality assurance and performance assessment .
various news accounts and identity crime experts report that the theft of a child's identity may go undetected for years until an event — such as an application for a driver's license — reveal that the child's identity was stolen .
despite ssa's efforts in recent years to improve its enumeration processes , several weaknesses persist , including a lack of eab program oversight and outreach , inefficient birth verification procedures , and other vulnerabilities that could adversely affect the integrity and efficiency of ssa's processes .
our standards for internal control provide a framework to help agencies address such weaknesses .
however , ssa has not fully incorporated some of these controls into its enumeration processes .
in addition , we contacted the national association of state auditors , comptrollers and treasurers ( nasact ) as well as individual state comptrollers and inspectors general to identify and obtain any relevant reviews of their state vital statistics agencies' birth registration and certification processes .
the recently passed intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 includes specific requirements to address these weaknesses .
also , our office of special investigations ( osi ) tested ssa's practices for issuing replacement cards to children by posing as parents of fictitious children and using counterfeit documents in an attempt to obtain multiple cards .
