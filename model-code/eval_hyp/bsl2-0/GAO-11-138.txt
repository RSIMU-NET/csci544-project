this report examines ( 1 ) whether u.s. development goals and projects for the afghan water sector align with the goals of the afghan government ; ( 2 ) u.s. agencies' coordination of water - sector development efforts among themselves , with the afghan government and with the donor community ; ( 3 ) the u.s. government's efforts to manage and monitor its water - sector projects ; and ( 4 ) the u.s. government's efforts to build sustainability into water - sector projects .
to address these objectives , we reviewed u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , department of defense ( dod ) , and other relevant u.s. government planning , funding , and reporting documents related to u.s. funding and projects for water - sector development in afghanistan .
as u.s. government documents indicate , u.s. water - sector development efforts support the u.s. government's counter - insurgency ( coin ) strategy in afghanistan .
between 2002 and the second quarter of 2010 , the u.s. government has awarded about $250 million for water development efforts in afghanistan and , in march 2010 , estimated it would need an additional $2.1 billion in funding to achieve u.s. development efforts in afghanistan's water sector from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014 .
we discussed the funding and projects with officials from usaid , dod's commander's emergency response program ( cerp ) , the departments of state and agriculture in afghanistan , and with usaid , dod , and other relevant agencies' officials in washington , d.c .
yet , only about 30 percent of afghanistan's agricultural land receives adequate water .
these projects represent about 50 percent of the total funding disbursed by usaid for water projects in afghanistan from fiscal year 2002 through the 2nd quarter of fiscal year 2010 .
additionally , we identified 19 usaid - funded infrastructure projects completed or ongoing since 2002 that contained water - related activities .
years of war and conflict , coupled with persistent drought , have had a devastating impact on the water sector of afghanistan .
to assess usaid's and dod's efforts to address water project sustainability in afghanistan , we identified two key elements necessary for project sustainability , as identified in the 2010 u.s. government inter - agency water strategy and other u.s. strategic documents: enhancing technical and managerial capacity and ensuring funding is available to keep projects operational after they have been completed .
we analyzed program budget data provided by usaid and dod .
these activities together accounted for about 50 percent of total usaid disbursed funding for water projects in afghanistan from fiscal year 2002 through the 2nd quarter of fiscal year 2010 .
we also met with some representatives of implementing partners for u.s. agencies and the donor community .
agriculture , the source of livelihood for almost 80 percent of the population , accounts for up to 93 percent of afghanistan's total water usage through irrigation .
we also reviewed cerp regulations to ascertain cerp planning and monitoring requirements for water projects , as well as prior gao reports that addressed cerp - funded development efforts in afghanistan .
we discussed these issues with usaid and dod officials in washington and afghanistan , as well as staff from implementing partner organizations .
