the consumer price index ( cpi ) is the principal measure of trends in consumer prices and inflation in the united states , according to the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , which publishes the cpi .
the commission's report also included the congressional budget office's estimate that such an overstatement — that is , bias — in the cpi would cause a $1.07 trillion rise in the national debt by the year 2008 .
in december 1996 , the advisory commission to study the cpi , which was appointed by the senate finance committee , issued a report estimating that the cpi overstates changes in the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points annually .
 ( the advisory commission is commonly referred to as “the boskin commission,” after its chairman michael j .
you asked for an updated estimate because of recent reports of changes bls has made in the methodology for calculating the cpi .
as agreed with your office , our objectives were to identify the methodological changes bls made to the cpi since december 1996 , when the boskin commission issued its final report ; and obtain the opinions of the five former boskin commission members on how much of the bias in the cpi that the commission estimated in its december 1996 report remains after recent methodological changes to the cpi .
as further agreed , we did not attempt to assess the validity of the boskin commission's 1996 estimate or the validity of the estimates former commission members gave for this report .
this report responds to your request that we obtain an update from the five former boskin commission members of the commission's estimate of the cpi bias .
the cpi significantly affects the u.s. budget because automatic cost - of - living adjustments in federal income tax brackets , federal retirees' pensions , and various federal programs , such as social security and food stamps , are linked to changes in the cpi .

what the cpi measures is clearly defined ; it measures the change in prices of a market basket of goods and services purchased directly by urban consumers .
these goods and services fall into eight major groups , including food and beverages , housing , apparel , transportation , medical care , recreation , education and communication , and other goods and services that people buy for day - to - day living .
further , the commission said that the cpi often erroneously attributed price increases to inflation instead of to quality improvements — advances in products and services that have affected peoples' lives .
bls expressed skepticism about the commission's estimate of new products / quality change bias and noted that the evidence the commission used for this estimate was sparse and that the commission did not have a well - defined methodology for deriving its estimate .
although the cpi is used to make cost - of - living adjustments , it is not , technically , a cost - of - living index .
