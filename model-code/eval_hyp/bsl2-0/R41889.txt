the fund aims to assist developing countries in their efforts to combat climate change through the provision of grants and other concessional financing for mitigation and adaptation projects , programs , policies , and activities .
the green climate fund ( gcf ) is an international financial institution connected to the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) .
they argue that mitigating climate change pollutants , adapting to the effects of climate change , and building climate resilience into their development agendas incur costs above and beyond their normal economic growth trajectories .
these costs are particularly challenging to nations that have scant resources compared to industrialized countries , do not recognize themselves as the historical sources of climate pollution , and consider alleviating poverty as their first priority .
proponents maintain that such assistance could help promote climate - friendly and high - growth economic development in these countries , while simultaneously protecting the more vulnerable nations from the effects of a changing climate .
initial funding came from germany , france , and a dozen other countries who pledged approximately $2.3 billion during the united nations climate summit in september 2014 .
further pledges brought the total to approximately $10 billion by the close of 2014 .
for their part , most , if not all , lower - income countries have stated that their success at combating climate change depends critically on receipt of international financial support .
the gcf currently complements many of the existing multilateral climate change funds ( e.g. , the global environment facility , the climate investment funds , and the adaptation fund ) ; however , as the official financial mechanism of the unfccc , some parties believe that it may eventually replace or subsume the other funds .
they include what role the gcf would play in providing sustained finance at adequate levels ; how it would fit into the existing development assistance and climate financing architecture ; whether sources beyond public funding would successfully contribute to it ; and how it would allocate and deliver assistance efficiently and effectively to developing countries .
parties called for an immediate capitalization of between $10 billion and $15 billion over the course of the first year .
the gcf is capitalized by contributions from donor countries and other sources , potentially including innovative mechanisms and the private sector .
many voices , domestic and international , have called upon the united states and other industrialized countries to increase foreign assistance to lower - and middle - income countries to address climate change .
the administration's fy2016 budget requested $500 million for the fund .
the obama administration announced a pledge of $3 billion over four years during the g - 20 meetings in australia on november 15 , 2014 .
expectations by many countries , specifically developing countries , are that the gcf becomes very large ( i.e. , in the range of several tens of billions to over $100 billion annually ) and serves as the predominant institution for climate change assistance in the developing world .
the u.s. congress — through its role in authorizations , appropriations , and oversight — would have significant input on u.s. participation in the fund , including whether and when to participate in the fund ; whether and how much to contribute to the fund , and with what source or sources of finance ; whether fund contributions would carry specific guidance in distribution and use ; how contributions to the fund would relate to other u.s. bilateral , multilateral , and private sector climate change assistance ; and whether and when to consent to negotiated treaty obligations , if submitted .
