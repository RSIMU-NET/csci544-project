this situation is further complicated in elections when an incumbent president who is retiring or who has failed to win reelection prepares to leave office , while the incoming president - elect prepares for inauguration .
presidential transitions in the past half - century have generally been characterized by high levels of activity and frequent improvisation as the president - elect's team works to finalize personnel and policy arrangements for the incoming administration within a period of just over 10 weeks .
succession and disability procedures concerning the president - elect and vice president - elect provide a potential complicating factor during the election period and the transition .
depending on circumstances , congress could be called on to make succession - related decisions of national importance in questions of the death , disability , or resignation of a president - or vice president - elect .
the process takes on further significance and complexity when , as noted previously , a new president replaces a retiring or defeated incumbent , or when political party control of the executive branch also changes .
for instance , the period between president barack h. obama's election to a second term on november 6 , 2012 , and his inauguration on january 20 , 2013 , was not a transition period as defined in this report .
it should be noted , however , that the period preceding the inauguration of presidents who have been elected to a second consecutive term does not generally fall under the definition of a presidential transition .
this report examines succession procedures that apply to major party nominees for president and vice president during the presidential election campaign and the first phase of the transition period , and for president - elect and vice president - elect during the second phase of the transition period .
the three - to - four month period of the presidential general election campaign , from the national party conventions through election day , and the 10-week transition period , from election day to the january 20 inauguration , present a different range of succession issues concerning presidential and vice presidential nominees during the campaign and the president - and vice president - elect during the transition .
these provisions apply at all times when a duly - sworn president or vice president holds office , but additional factors enter the equation during presidential election years .
they are based on a combination of political party rules , federal law , and constitutional provisions , different elements of which apply at different times during the whole period between the national conventions and inauguration of the incoming chief executive .
the transition's second phase begins when the electors cast their votes and the electoral vote is announced .
during this period , with few exceptions , the winning candidates are known on the basis of the popular vote tally and the projected electoral vote results .
in modern times , the transition period is considered to start immediately after the general election , and extends through january 20 of the following year .
the new president then nominates a successor vice president , subject to confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of congress .
in the event there is neither a president nor a vice president , the presidential succession act provides that the speaker of the house of representatives , the president pro tempore of the senate , and duly - confirmed cabinet officers , in order of the seniority of their departments , would be eligible to act as president .
