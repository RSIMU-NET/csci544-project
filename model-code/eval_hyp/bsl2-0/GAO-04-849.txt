the changes called for generally include ( 1 ) amending the definition of net worth to include alternative forms of capital , such as unsecured subordinated debt instruments — known as secondary capital instruments ; ( 2 ) moving to risk - based capital standards ; and ( 3 ) some combination of the changes discussed above .
since the implementation of pca for credit unions , some sectors of the credit union industry have been calling for changes to the capital requirements for credit unions .
under pca , credit unions that are less than well - capitalized must take actions prescribed by statute and discretionary actions developed by ncua based on the institutions' capitalization category .
instead , as noted by ncua , section 116 of the federal credit union act ( fcua ) required credit unions to make a periodic reserve transfer until reserves reached 6 percent of risk - assets ( 10 percent for credit unions with under $5 million in assets ) .
as agreed , you asked us to describe ( 1 ) the underlying concerns that have prompted the credit union industry's interest in making changes to the current capital requirements , ( 2 ) the issues associated with the potential use of secondary capital in all federally insured credit unions , and ( 3 ) the issues associated with the potential use of risk - based capital in all federally insured credit unions .
then in 1998 , the credit union membership access act ( cumaa ) established a capital - based supervisory framework called prompt corrective action ( pca ) that requires ncua to classify federally insured credit unions into five categories — well - capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized , and critically undercapitalized — based on net - worth - to - total - assets ratios .
prior to 1998 , the national credit union administration ( ncua ) , which regulates federally chartered credit unions and certain aspects of federally insured state - chartered credit unions , did not impose any net worth requirement on federally insured credit unions .
recent debate about and support for changes to the existing capital requirements for credit unions — which establishes the percentage of net worth to total assets that they must maintain — has raised concerns about potential safety and soundness implications .
to identify and describe concerns regarding the current capital requirements for credit unions , we interviewed credit union industry groups , several credit union chief executive officers , credit union regulators and two banking regulators .
credit unions are member - owned cooperatives that are exempt from federal income taxes .
capital is also commonly viewed as a measure of financial strength .
they do not issue capital stock ; rather , they are not - for - profit entities that build capital by retaining earnings .
from a regulatory perspective , capital acts as a buffer against unexpected operating losses or other adverse financial results .
credit unions , which have approximately 82 million members across the united states , historically have occupied a unique niche among depository institutions .
additionally , in these interviews we gathered information on the issues and concerns associated with the potential use of secondary capital and risk - based capital by credit unions .
