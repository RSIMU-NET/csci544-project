arguing that the costs of complying with some of the new accountability measures far outweigh what they receive in federal funds , a number of states and school districts have protested what they perceive as a lack of federal assistance for some of the act's more controversial requirements , such as the testing and school choice provisions .
perhaps the most notable feature of nclb is the wide array of assessment and accountability measures that seek to improve student achievement and performance , particularly in troubled schools .
other critics have questioned whether mandating that states pay for the costs associated with some of the act's requirements is even lawful , given the language of § 9527 ( a ) .
enacted in 2002 , the nclb act reauthorized and revised the esea , which is the primary federal law that provides financial assistance to state and local school districts for pre - collegiate education .
for example , the act mandates that states administer annual tests in reading and mathematics for students in grades 3-8 , requires that schools make adequate yearly progress toward improving student performance , establishes a series of required actions for schools that fail to meet such performance standards , and adds new requirements regarding teacher qualifications .
plaintiffs also sought an injunction prohibiting the secretary from withholding from states and school districts any federal funds to which they are entitled under the nclb because of a failure to comply with the mandates of the nclb that is attributable to a refusal to spend non - nclb funds to achieve such compliance .
the bulk of the new accountability requirements are tied to the title i , part a program for disadvantaged students , which is the largest source of federal funding for elementary and secondary education .
the nea sought a declaratory judgment to the effect that states and school districts are not required to spend non - nclb funds to comply with the nclb mandates , and that a failure to comply with the nclb mandates for this reason does not provide a basis for withholding any federal funds to which they are otherwise entitled under the nclb .
indeed , in 2005 , the national education association ( nea ) , in conjunction with eight school districts in michigan , texas , and vermont , filed a lawsuit claiming that the secretary of education was violating both the "unfunded mandates" provision and the spending clause of the u.s. constitution .
section 9527 ( a ) — the so - called "unfunded mandates" provision — states , "nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the federal government to ... mandate a state or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this act. .
in its ruling , the district court concluded that § 9527 ( a ) should be interpreted as a prohibition against the imposition by federal officers and employees of additional , unfunded requirements beyond those provided for in the statute , rather than as an exemption from the statute's requirements when the federal government fails to fully fund the title i program .
the decision in school district of the city of pontiac v. secretary of the united states department of education arose in response to litigation surrounding § 9527 ( a ) of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind ( nclb ) act of 2001 .
