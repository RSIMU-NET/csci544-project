in november 2005 , dhs launched the secure border initiative ( sbi ) , a multiyear , multibillion - dollar program to secure the nation's borders through enhanced use of surveillance technologies , increased staffing levels , improved infrastructure , and increased domestic enforcement of immigration laws .
this program is managed by the sbinet system program office within u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) .
because of the size and complexity of sbinet , and the problems experienced by its predecessors , you asked us to determine whether dhs ( 1 ) has defined the scope and timing of planned sbinet capabilities and how these capabilities will be developed and deployed , ( 2 ) is effectively defining and managing sbinet requirements , and ( 3 ) is effectively managing sbinet testing .
in response , dhs established the america's shield initiative in 2004 , but this program was halted in 2005 because of the program's limited scope and the department's shift in strategy for achieving border security and interior enforcement goals .
one component of sbi , known as sbinet , is focused on the acquisition and deployment of surveillance and communications technologies .
specifically , the former immigration and naturalization service's integrated surveillance intelligence system , begun in the late 1990s , was difficult and expensive to maintain ; it provided limited command , control , and situational awareness capability ; and its component systems were not integrated .
as we have reported , previous attempts to acquire and deploy surveillance technologies along the nation's borders to assist in detecting and responding to illegal entries have not been successful .
although the department of homeland security ( dhs ) apprehends hundreds of thousands of people entering the country illegally each year , many more unauthorized entrants go undetected .
to accomplish our objectives , we reviewed key program documentation , including guidance , plans , and requirements and testing documentation .
securing the nation's borders from illegal entry of aliens and contraband continues to be a major challenge because much of the 6,000 miles of international borders with canada and mexico remains vulnerable to unlawful activities .
in cases where such documentation was not available , we interviewed program officials about the development of capabilities and the management of requirements and testing .
we then compared this information to relevant federal system acquisition guidance .
implement key requirements development and management practices to include ( 1 ) baselining requirements before system design and development efforts begin ; ( 2 ) analyzing requirements prior to being baselined to ensure that they are complete , achievable , and verifiable ; and ( 3 ) tracing requirements to higher - level requirements , lower - level requirements , and test cases .
the absence of clarity and stability in these key aspects of sbinet introduces considerable program risks , hampers dhs's ability to measure program progress , and impairs the ability of the congress to oversee the program and hold dhs accountable for program results .
further details of our objectives , scope , and methodology are included in appendix i .
to improve dhs's efforts to acquire and implement sbinet we are making eight recommendations .
ensure that the revised and approved life cycle management approach is fully implemented .
