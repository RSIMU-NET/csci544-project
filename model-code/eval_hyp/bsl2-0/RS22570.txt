under president obama , secretary gates issued the quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) in february 2010 , in which the united states noted the importance of implementing the u.s. - japan realignment roadmap of 2006 that will ensure the deployment of u.s. forces in japan and transform guam into a regional security hub .
guam is critical to enhancing the forward presence , strengthening alliances , and shaping china's rise .
the qdr also announced the development of a new joint air - sea battle concept , to integrate the air , sea , land , space , and cyberspace forces of the air force and navy to counter challenges to u.s. freedom of action , defeat adversaries with sophisticated anti - access and area - denial ( a2 / ad ) capabilities , and improve power projection operations .
as the defense department faced increased tension on the korean peninsula , the pacific command ( pacom ) based in honolulu began in 2000 to build up air and naval forces on guam to boost u.s. deterrence and power projection in asia .
there are about 6,000 military personnel .
visiting guam in may 2008 , defense secretary robert gates said that guam's buildup will be "one of the largest movements of military assets in decades" and will help to "maintain a robust military presence in a critical part of the world. .
as part of the obama administration's effort to re - engage throughout the asian - pacific region and reassure allies and partners facing a rising china that views the united states as an "outside" power , gates participated at an annual asian - pacific defense ministers' meeting in june 2010 in singapore at which he declared that the united states is a pacific nation and will remain a "power in the pacific. .
he highlighted the south china sea as an area of growing concern .
he also stated that the defense buildup on guam is part of a shift in the u.s. defense posture in asia , a shift to be more geographically distributed , operationally resilient , and politically sustainable .
guam has two important u.s. military bases: apra naval base and andersen air force base .
deputy defense secretary william lynn iii visited guam in july and stressed guam's value , saying "from bases here , our forces can ensure the security of our allies , quickly respond to disaster and humanitarian needs , safeguard the sea lanes that are so vital to the world economy , and address any military provocation that may occur. .
still , he declared a sharper focus on the asian - pacific region in balancing risks from an aggressive north korea and a more assertive china and in defending freedom of navigation .
