this report provides answers to frequently asked legal questions about filling supreme court vacancies .
the unexpected death of supreme court justice antonin scalia on february 13 , 2016 — in the middle of the supreme court's october 2015 term — has prompted questions about the process for filling the vacancy and how the court will proceed in hearing cases and issuing opinions .
historically , by statute congress has set the number of justices for the court .
the constitution is silent on the number .
the supreme court is not required to have nine justices .
but only six justices are needed for a quorum .
currently , that number is nine: one chief justice plus eight associate justices .
the senate's prerogatives under the appointments clause are even less clear .
the unexpected death of supreme court justice antonin scalia on february 13 , 2016 — in the middle of the supreme court's october 2015 term — has prompted questions about the process for filling the vacancy and how the court may proceed in hearing cases and issuing opinions .
in particular , these questions pertain to the constitutional role of the president and senate in filling supreme court vacancies , when the p resident and the senate must act , and how the supreme court may continue hearing cases and issuing opinions with a vacant seat .
accordingly , there is disagreement in the legal community about the senate's role in presidential appointments .
although there is no doubt that the senate has a constitutional role in the appointments process , much of the disagreement surrounds how robust that role is , especially concerning advice .
in the past , the senate has provided its advice and consent by various means , ranging from committee hearings to a vote on the senate floor .
the obama administration similarly contends that the senate has a constitutional obligation to act — a position previously taken by the george w. bush administration .
in the event that the court is scheduled to hold a session but there is not a quorum , the justices ( or the clerk or deputy clerk ) may announce that the court will not meet until a quorum is restored .
