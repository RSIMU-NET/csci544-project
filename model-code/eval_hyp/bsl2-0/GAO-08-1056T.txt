in the briefing , vha officials disclosed that $4.8 billion ( 56 percent ) of the reported $8.6 billion in procurements through the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 had been done using funds categorized as miscellaneous obligations .
today , my testimony will focus on our preliminary observations related to ( 1 ) how vha used miscellaneous obligations during fiscal year 2007 , and ( 2 ) whether va's policies and procedures are designed to provide adequate controls over the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations .
vha officials briefed your subcommittee staff in september 2007 about various financial reporting weaknesses in the agency and initiatives under way to address them .
according to the department of veterans' affairs ( va ) policy , miscellaneous obligations can be used to record estimated obligations to facilitate the procurement of a variety of goods and services , including fee - based medical and nursing services ; beneficiary travel ; and for other purposes .
in addition , va's office of inspector general ( oig ) issued a report in may 2007 on the alleged mismanagement of funds at the va boston healthcare system .
in light of these concerns , you requested that we review whether the design of vha's internal controls over the use of miscellaneous obligations was adequate for fiscal year 2007 .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the veterans health administration's ( vha ) use of miscellaneous obligations .
vha officials said that they have been using miscellaneous obligations for over 60 years to record estimates of obligations to be incurred at a later time .
according to oig officials , they obtained documents showing that a miscellaneous obligation for $200,000 was requested , approved , and obligated by the same fiscal official , calling into question the adequacy of the segregation of duty controls over miscellaneous obligations .
we recently provided our draft report , including recommendations , on the results of our audit to the secretary of veterans affairs for review and comment .
we plan to incorporate va's comments as appropriate and issue our final report as a follow - up to this testimony .
further background information on vha's operations is included in appendix ii .
we conducted this audit from november 2007 through july 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
although miscellaneous obligations can facilitate and streamline the procurement process , they require effectively designed mitigating controls to avoid impairing full accountability and transparency .
such a review is essential in ensuring that the policies and procedures comply with federal funds control laws and regulations and any other relevant va policies or procedures dealing with budgetary or procurement matters .
details on our scope and methodology are included in appendix i .
improved controls in the form of detailed policies and procedures , along with a management oversight mechanism , will be critical to reducing the government's risks from va's use of miscellaneous obligations .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
effectively designed internal controls serve as the first line of defense for preventing and detecting fraud , and they help ensure that an agency effectively and efficiently meets its missions , goals , and objectives ; complies with laws and regulations ; and is able to provide reliable financial and other information concerning its programs , operations , and activities .
