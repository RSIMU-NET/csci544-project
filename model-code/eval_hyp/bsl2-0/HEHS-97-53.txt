these challenges included managing for results and accountability ; funding future retirement benefits ; rethinking disability programs ; combating ssi fraud , waste , and abuse ; handling increasing workloads with reduced resources ; and establishing effective leadership .
to bolster ssa's ability to address critical policy issues and correct programmatic weaknesses , the congress enacted legislation making ssa independent of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) as of march 31 , 1995 .
yet as ssa acknowledges , public confidence in its programs is low and has been low for some time .
although much of this lack of confidence stems from concerns about the future solvency of the social security system , public confidence also has been eroded by reports of fraud and abuse .
any failure to do so seriously undermines the public's confidence in government and its ability to efficiently and cost - effectively administer programs and protect taxpayer dollars .
the social security administration ( ssa ) administers the nation's largest federal program — social security — as well as the nation's largest cash welfare program , supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
ssa's expenditures totaled $363 billion in fiscal year 1995 , nearly one - fourth of the nation's $1.5 trillion federal budget .
media accounts of problems such as prisoners erroneously receiving disability checks and allegations that immigrants and children are feigning mental illness to obtain ssi undermine the public's trust in ssa and in the federal government .
after ssa's first year as an independent agency , we reported on its progress in meeting current and future challenges .
as we noted in our february 1995 report on ssa's transition to independence , such independence heightens the importance of ssa's playing a strong leadership role in addressing long - standing problems and preparing for future challenges .
in establishing ssa's independence , the congress recognized the importance of strong and stable leadership for the agency .
social security's old age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) and disability insurance ( di ) programs provide benefits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors ; ssi provides assistance to the needy aged , blind , or disabled .
to do our work , we drew from completed and ongoing gao work on social security issues and reviewed recent legislation affecting ssa .
this report updates and expands on the challenges facing ssa's new commissioner and the agency .
ssa recognizes that the american public depends on it to quickly and accurately provide benefits , properly record workers' earnings , and effectively safeguard benefit programs from fraud and abuse .
in 1995 alone , an estimated 24 million people visited ssa's 1,300 field offices , and ssa received 62 million calls on the agency's nationwide toll - free 800 number .
ssa's programs touch the lives of almost every individual in this country .
moreover , ssa maintains a large and visible presence in communities nationwide .
in 1995 , 50 million beneficiaries — about one out of every five individuals in this country — received benefits from ssa each month .
with a staff of 65,000 , ssa also records the wages of nearly every u.s. worker each year and issued almost 17 million social security cards in 1995 .
