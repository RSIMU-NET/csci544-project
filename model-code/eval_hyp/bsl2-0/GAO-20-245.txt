in fiscal year 2019 , the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) reported apprehending almost 527,000 individuals at or between u.s. ports of entry along the southwest border who were members of noncitizen family units ( parents and children under 18 years old ) — a 227 percent increase over fiscal year 2018 .
if dhs determines that noncitizen children should be separated from their parents , dhs then considers the children to be uac — children who ( 1 ) have no lawful immigration status in the united states , ( 2 ) have not attained 18 years of age , and ( 3 ) have no parent or legal guardian in the united states available to provide care and physical custody .
cbp may hold family units , in the short - term , in facilities for general processing and determining , in coordination with dhs's u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , the next appropriate course of action , such as release into or removal from the united states .
dhs then refers the uac to the custody of the office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , consistent with federal law .
in july 2019 , the acting dhs secretary testified that the majority of individuals apprehended by cbp in fiscal year 2019 were family units or unaccompanied alien children ( uac ) .
in addition , he stated that cbp's u.s. border patrol and office of field operations ( ofo ) were apprehending increasingly larger groups at and between ports of entry , straining cbp's resources to process these individuals .
for example , in may 2019 , border patrol apprehended a group of more than 1,000 individuals ( 900 of whom were identified as members of family units ) in its el paso sector , the largest group ever apprehended by border patrol .
in 2018 , we reported on dhs and hhs processes for tracking and reunifying families that dhs separated at the southwest border in fiscal year 2018 .
ice maintains custody of family units in long - term detention facilities , known as family residential centers , and monitors those released into the country to await their immigration removal proceedings before an immigration judge .
this report examines ( 1 ) what cbp data indicate about the numbers and characteristics of family units apprehended along the southwest border , ( 2 ) the extent to which cbp has developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing family units apprehended along the southwest border , ( 3 ) the extent to which ice has developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing family units apprehended along the southwest border , and ( 4 ) how dhs and hhs share information about uac , including children who initially arrived with and were separated from their parents or other adults .
in addition , to address all of our objectives , we interviewed dhs and hhs officials .
2 ) .
to assess the reliability of cbp data , we completed a number of steps , including ( 1 ) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness , such as running logic tests ; ( 2 ) reviewing existing information about the data and the systems that produced them , such as relevant training materials for border patrol agents and ofo officers who use agency data systems ; and ( 3 ) discussing data entry issues and data limitations with border patrol and ofo officials .
