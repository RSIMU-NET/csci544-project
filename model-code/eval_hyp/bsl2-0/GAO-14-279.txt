entails collecting data on measures of quality and cost of care , assessing performance against benchmarks , and communicating results to providers .
private feedback reports are generally designed to identify differences between providers' current practices and desired performance and may be combined with financial incentives to encourage improvement .
they reward those who coordinate services across providers and make cost - effective referral decisions , among other practices .
it can also be used with newer care delivery models , such as accountable care organizations ( aco ) and patient - centered medical homes.hold teams of providers responsible for all of a patient's care .
the expectation is that giving detailed , timely feedback to providers will enhance their ability to take actions that improve performance .
vbp can be used as a means to improving quality and efficiency in the traditional health care delivery environment by encouraging providers to address gaps in patient care and consider the likely costs and benefits of care .
other performance reporting makes provider information available to the public through recognition programs or websites , thus using professional reputation to promote high - quality care .
for example , periodic feedback reports can make providers aware of the percentage of their patients receiving appropriate screening tests , or those with potentially avoidable emergency department visits .
therefore , a key element of the vbp approach is for payers to develop performance feedback reports to indicate specific opportunities for improvement .
under these arrangements , payers while physicians and other providers may intend to furnish consistently high - quality , efficient care , they may not always know how well they do or where practice changes are needed .
one such approach — known as value - based payment ( vbp ) — links a portion of physician compensation to achieving specified levels of performance .
in some cases , entities had multiple performance reporting initiatives .
increasingly , health care payers — including medicare — are rethinking the way they reimburse providers in an attempt to shift away from paying solely for the volume of care delivered and toward paying them for the value of their care .
to make our selection , we asked representatives of america's health insurance plans , blue cross blue shield association , and network for regional healthcare improvement to suggest leading organizations that met those criteria .
we also considered programs profiled in peer - reviewed literature , as well as those operating in varying geographic areas across the country .
our findings also support past gao recommendations that cms reward physicians for improvement as well as performance against absolute benchmarks , and develop a strategy to reliably measure solo and small practices , such as by aggregating data .
this report contains information we provided during those briefings , updated with additional information , addressing 1. how and when private entities — such as health insurers — report performance data to physicians , and what information they report ; and 2. how the timing and approach cms uses to report performance data to physicians compare to that of private entities .
we chose six health insurers , and three statewide health care collaboratives — organizations comprising providers , payers , and employers that focus on quality improvement activities — as follows: aetna blue shield of california blue cross and blue shield of florida , inc. highmark blue cross blue shield horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey maine health management coalition oregon health care quality corporation we interviewed representatives of these private entities regarding the feedback report recipients , data sources used , types of performance measures and benchmarks , frequency of reporting , and efforts to enhance the utility of their performance reports .
