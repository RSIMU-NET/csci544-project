although the economy is experiencing productivity gains and moderate expansion in output , it nonetheless continues to struggle with declining , but still high unemployment and a large federal debt .
these domestic imbalances are connected to international ones , including the large u.s. trade deficit , rising holdings of u.s. debt by foreign countries , and downward pressure on the dollar .
for the united states , this would involve increased saving ( less spending ) relative to investment that would produce a rise in net exports ( reduction in trade deficit ) .
the rise of brazil , india , and china , among other emerging economies , presents new challenges in u.s. trade policy and in developing global trade and finance agreements .
third , economic tensions emanating from large international imbalances have not eased .
the 113th congress , in exercising both its legislative and oversight responsibilities , faces numerous international trade and finance policy issues .
the united states has long consumed more than it has produced , giving rise to the expanding trade deficit , which is financed by capital inflows .
second , developing country influence and role in the global economy are growing , as witnessed by changing trade and investment patterns , as well as the ascendance of the group of 20 ( g - 20 ) economies as a major forum for international economic cooperation .
first , the world continues to recover unevenly from the 2008 global financial crisis , with many developed countries experiencing weak growth and the large emerging economies , such as china , india , and brazil experiencing slower growth .
the sovereign debt crisis in europe and increased vulnerability of the eurozone are among the most visible examples .
international trade and finance issues are complex , and policy deliberation is often made more challenging by developments in the global economy .
the u.s. economy is recovering slowly from its worst recession in eight decades .
they include: renewal of trade promotion authority ( tpa ) ; potential trade agreements including the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) , the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) , and the trade in services agreement ( tisa ) , and also expanded agreements in information technology products and trade facilitation under the wto ; u.s. - china trade relations ; international finance issues ; review of the u.s. export control regime ; reauthorization of the export - import bank ; and reauthorization of u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) and expiring trade preference programs .
rising economic powers , whose strong growth represents expanding markets for u.s. goods , may also be turning to less expansionist macroeconomic policies .
during the first session of the 113th congress , while overshadowed by other legislative priorities , including federal budget issues , trade and trade policy issues were the subject of active congressional interest , including through oversight committee hearings , if not direct legislative action .
meeting the goal of doubling exports , however , will be difficult because trade policy by itself is limited in its ability to affect the trade deficit and aggregate output , which will require vibrant global economic growth , a competitive dollar , and changes in domestic and foreign macroeconomic policies .
