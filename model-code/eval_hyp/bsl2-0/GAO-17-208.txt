two federal performance partnership initiatives have been authorized by congress .
the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) performance partnership grants ( ppg ) , under its national environmental performance partnership system ( nepps ) , have been in place for 20 years .
in recent years , the office of management and budget ( omb ) has encouraged agencies to explore performance partnerships and other mechanisms , including tiered - evidence grants and pay for success , as means by which to make federal programs more evidence - focused and test innovations in service delivery and different approaches to improving program outcomes .
over the past 3 years , 8 federal agencies — omb ; the departments of education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , justice ( doj ) , and labor ( dol ) ; the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) ; and the institute for museum and library services ( imls ) — have worked to design and implement the pilots .
performance partnership initiatives , which are authorized by law , allow a federal agency or multiple federal agencies to provide grant recipients flexibility in how they use funding across 2 or more programs along with additional flexibilities in exchange for the recipient's commitment to improve agreed - upon outcomes and assess progress towards them .
gprama also requires us to periodically report on how its implementation is affecting performance management at federal agencies , including whether agencies are using performance management to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their programs .
within these initiatives , federal agencies can enter into multiple individual performance partnerships tailored to the recipient .
some federal agencies and state and local governments have attempted to balance federal interests with recipient priorities in grants administration by using a mechanism known as a performance partnership .
although both are interested in efficiency and effectiveness , the federal government ensures accountability for the expenditure of grant funds through common reporting and audit requirements , while grant recipients often seek flexibility to be responsive to state or local priorities and minimize grant - related administrative burden .
according to omb , because performance partnerships require federal agencies and grant recipients to manage toward outcomes , these initiatives can help the 2 sides measure program performance and collect information about what works .
the other and more recent initiative is the multiple - agency performance partnership pilots for disconnected youth ( disconnected youth pilots ) , which were first authorized in january 2014 .
this focus on performance management and evidence - based decision making can help agencies and recipients determine how federal resources can be used more efficiently and effectively .
the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) put into place a framework intended to increase the use of performance information and other evidence in federal decision making .
however , while the federal government and state or local grant recipients often share common purposes , they can have different priorities .
the federal government spends more than $600 billion a year on federal grants to state and local governments , nonprofits , and educational institutions to fund a wide range of programs and services to address critical national objectives , such as providing education and job training to vulnerable populations and addressing environmental challenges .
