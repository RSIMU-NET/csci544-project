as the current strategy's end date approaches , usaid is deliberating its post - 2015 strategy for basic education assistance .
usaid education strategy 2011-2015 ( washington , d.c.: february 2011 ) .
this report ( 1 ) examines five usaid missions' implementation , performance monitoring , and evaluation of primary grade reading programs and ( 2 ) assesses usaid's efforts to estimate progress toward the 2011-2015 education strategy's primary grade reading goal .
however , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) reports that while many developing countries have achieved important gains in enrolling children in primary school , reading skills remain very low .
in addition , the strategy included guidelines for monitoring and evaluating usaid's progress in achieving its basic education goals .
u.s. agency for international development , education: opportunity through learning .
in preparing our report , we analyzed usaid's 2011-2015 education strategy , related guidance , and funding for basic education for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 .
learning to read is the foundation for future learning , and greater educational attainment contributes to economic growth , improved health outcomes , and democratic governance .
usaid's 2011-2015 education strategy , issued in february 2011 , includes three goals: improved reading skills for 100 million children in primary grades by 2015 ( goal 1 ) , improved ability of tertiary and workforce development programs to produce a workforce with relevant skills to support country development goals by 2015 ( goal 2 ) , and increased equitable access to education in crisis and conflict environments for 15 million learners by 2015 ( goal 3 ) .
we selected these countries because they are geographically diverse and had received relatively large levels of u.s. funding for basic education .
you asked us to review usaid's basic education programming .
to assess usaid's efforts to estimate progress toward its primary grade reading goal — our second objective — we reviewed the usaid education strategy and usaid policies and guidelines for completing reading assessments and analyzed usaid reports on missions' collection of reading assessment data .
in some countries , 70 to 90 percent of students tested at the end of 2 to 3 years of schooling were unable read a single word correctly in the first line of a simple passage .
we also conducted fieldwork in five countries — ethiopia , malawi , peru , the philippines , and uganda .
we also selected these countries because the usaid missions in these countries had implemented primary grade reading programs and had conducted at least baseline reading assessments .
to examine the five missions' implementation , performance monitoring , and evaluation of primary grade reading programs — our first objective — we reviewed usaid guidance as well as documentation from the missions and interviewed usaid officials .
in august 2011 , usaid issued guidance for implementing the education strategy , directing missions with basic education programs in non - crisis and conflict environments to narrow the focus of their interventions to achieving the goal of improving early grade reading by the end of fiscal year 2012 .
while performance monitoring is required for all programs , usaid's evaluation policy requires performance or impact evaluations of all large projects .
