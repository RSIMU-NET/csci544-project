however , these initiatives were not enacted by congress and were controversial among american samoans .
in the mid - 1990s , legislative proposals were developed that would have included the establishment of a federal court in american samoa .
then , again , in february 2006 , the delegate from american samoa introduced legislation in the u.s. congress to establish a federal court in american samoa and later that month , the american samoa legislature held a public hearing to solicit public comments .
a u.s. territory since the early 1900s , american samoa has internal self - government under a locally adopted constitution , and the high court of american samoa is not part of the u.s. federal judicial structure .
the issue of establishing a federal court in american samoa is not new .
specifically , we discussed ( 1 ) the current system and structure for adjudicating matters of federal law arising in american samoa and how it compares to those in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) , guam , and the u.s. virgin islands ( usvi ) ; ( 2 ) the reasons that have been offered for or against changing the current system and structure for adjudicating matters of federal law in american samoa ; ( 3 ) different scenarios for establishing a federal court in american samoa or expanding the federal jurisdiction of the high court of american samoa if a change to the current system were made , and the identification of issues associated with each scenario ; and , ( 4 ) the potential cost elements and funding sources associated with implementing the different scenarios for establishing a federal court in american samoa .
no congressional actions were taken on the bill and the delegate from american samoa withdrew the legislation after he and others requested a gao report , which was issued on june 27 , 2008 .
american samoa's local judiciary was initially created and administered by the u.s. navy , but since 1951 has operated under the authority of the secretary of the interior , who appoints the high court chief justice and associate justice .
american samoa is unique among u.s. insular areas in that it does not have a federal court .
my statement is based on our june 2008 report , which examined the unique judicial structure of american samoa and identified the issues associated with establishing a federal court in american samoa .
however , this initiative was not enacted by congress .
we conducted our prior performance audit from april 2007 to june 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss federal court options for american samoa .
in addition , in the mid - 1990s , the department of justice ( doj ) proposed legislative options for changing the judicial structure of american samoa , including establishing a federal court within the territory .
however , while the house committee on resources held hearings on the doj report in august 1995 , and judicial committees studied various legislative options , congress did not take any actions on the proposals .
these proposals were developed in response to growing concerns involving white - collar crime in american samoa , which were detailed in a december 1994 doj crime assessment report .
