in a fiscal environment in which state and local governments are looking to build high - capacity transit systems with limited funding , brt has emerged as a potentially cost - effective alternative to new or extended rail transit projects .
since 2005 , opportunities for federal capital funding for brt projects in the u.s. have expanded due in part to changes made in the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea - lu ) .
brt can provide several benefits to riders and the community , including improved mobility and reliability for riders , reduced travel times , reduced carbon emissions , and increased economic development .
you asked us to examine the features of brt projects recommended for funding by the federal transit administration ( fta ) , as well as assess how these projects compare to rail transit .
specifically , safetea - lu revised eligibility for major capital investment projects to include not only fixed - guideway systems but also corridor - based bus capital projects if specific criteria are met .
however , it is possible that limits on the total project cost create incentives for brt project sponsors to omit more costly brt features .
the funding these programs provide to smaller transit projects has allowed communities that otherwise may not have been as competitive in the new starts process to obtain federal transit support .
to what extent do brt projects provide economic development and other benefits to communities ? .
in the u.s. , brt features vary , but generally include improvements to infrastructure , technology , and passenger amenities over standard bus service to attract new riders .
in general , though , it appears that brt project sponsors are using the small and very small starts programs to design and implement projects that address their communities' current transit needs and align with the projects sponsors' overall objectives .
moreover , project sponsors may develop initial plans for brts that do not include a comprehensive range of features , knowing that they can incorporate additional features into brt projects incrementally as communities' transit needs and financial circumstances change .
bus rapid transit ( brt ) has generated interest around the world for its potential to alleviate the adverse effects of traffic congestion and support economic growth , while generally having lower capital costs than rail transit .
we included 55 ( 30 brt and 25 rail transit ) planned or completed projects that had construction grant agreements from fiscal year 2005 through february 2012 .
many of these brt systems incorporate dedicated lanes ; large stations ; higher passenger capacities ; and quick service that can rival rail transit .
the limited use of brt's more costly features might also partly reflect the relatively large role that the small and very small starts programs have played in funding recent brt projects as compared to state and local funding sources .
how do the costs of these projects differ from rail transit projects ? .
therefore , project sponsors in cities with limited transit funding sources and without major congestion issues may find the added cost of these features worthwhile only if economic development is among their projects' primary objectives .
