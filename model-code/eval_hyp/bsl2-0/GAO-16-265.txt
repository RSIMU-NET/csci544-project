our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) describe the extent to which security and privacy incidents were reported for healthcare.gov or key supporting systems ; ( 2 ) assess the effectiveness of the controls implemented by cms to protect the data hub and the information it transmits ; and ( 3 ) assess the effectiveness of cms's oversight of key program elements and controls implemented by state - based marketplaces and the effectiveness of those elements at selected state - based marketplaces to protect the information they contain .
the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) is responsible for overseeing the establishment and operation of these marketplaces , including creating a federally facilitated marketplace in states not establishing their own .
this report examines the privacy and security issues related to the implementation of the federal services data hub ( data hub ) — a portal for exchanging information between the federal marketplace and cms's external partners — and cms's oversight of the state - based marketplaces .
sensitive information , such as detailed descriptions of information security weaknesses , has been omitted .
the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , signed into law on march 23 , 2010 , includes provisions to reform aspects of the private health insurance market and expand the availability and affordability of health care coverage .
given the high degree of congressional interest in the development and launch of the marketplaces , gao has conducted a body of work in this area in order to assist congress with its oversight responsibilities , of which this is the final report .
nevertheless , it addresses the same objectives and scope as the limited official use only report .
states choosing to implement their own marketplaces are responsible for securing the information systems that support the marketplace and their connections to the federal marketplace and for protecting the data collected and processed by the marketplace .
this is a public version of a limited official use only report we issued in march 2016 .
these marketplaces are required to allow consumers and small employers to compare , select , and purchase health insurance offered by participating private issuers of qualified health plans .
to address our first objective , we reviewed and analyzed data on information security and privacy incidents reported by cms affecting healthcare.gov and its supporting systems .
also , the overall methodology used for both reports is the same .
it required the establishment of health insurance exchanges , now commonly referred to as “marketplaces,” in each state by january 1 , 2014 .
in order to evaluate cms's controls over its information systems supporting healthcare.gov , we used our federal information system controls audit manual , which contains guidance for reviewing information system controls that affect the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of computerized information ; national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) standards and guidelines ; and cms policies , procedures , practices , and standards .
to assess the effectiveness of the three selected states' key management controls , we compared their documented policies , procedures , and practices to the provisions and requirements contained in cms security and privacy standards for state - based marketplaces .
