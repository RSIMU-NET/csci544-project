on march 25 , 2011 , the equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) issued final regulations implementing the ada amendments act .
the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) is a broad civil rights act prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities .
congress responded to these decisions by enacting the ada amendments act , p.l .
110-325 , was enacted in 2008 to amend the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) .
two of the major changes made by the ada amendments act are to expand the current interpretation of when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity ( rejecting the supreme court's interpretation in toyota ) , and to require that the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity must be made without regard to the use of mitigating measures ( rejecting the supreme court's decisions in sutton , murphy , and kirkingburg ) .
the ada amendment act ( adaaa ) , p.l .
several supreme court decisions interpreted the definition of disability , generally limiting its application .
110-325 , which rejects the supreme court and lower court interpretations and amends the ada to provide broader coverage .
as stated in the act , its purpose is "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. .
the threshold issue in any ada case is whether the individual alleging discrimination is an individual with a disability .
the adaaa reiterated this purpose , and also emphasized that it was "reinstating a broad scope of protection" for individuals with disabilities .
the ada amendments act defines the term disability with respect to an individual as " ( a ) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual ; ( b ) a record of such an impairment ; or ( c ) being regarded as having such an impairment ( as described in paragraph ( 3 ) ) . .
the eeoc issued final adaaa regulations on march 25 , 2011 , which will become effective on may 24 , 2011 .
a mitigating measure , for example , a wheelchair or medication , eliminates or reduces the symptoms or impact of an impairment .
the term substantially limits is to be broadly construed to provide expansive coverage , and requires an individualized determination .
110-325 specifically states that the then - current equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) regulations defining the term "substantially limits" as "significantly restricted" are "inconsistent with congressional intent , by expressing too high a standard. .
several of the major regulatory interpretations are as follows: including the operation of major bodily functions in the definition of major life activities ; adding rules of construction for when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity , and providing examples of impairments that will most often be found to substantially limit a major life activity ; interpreting the coverage of transitory impairments ; interpreting the use of mitigating measures ; and interpreting the "regarded as" prong of the definition .
generally , the regulations provide that not every impairment is a disability but an impairment does not have to prevent or severely limit a major life activity to be considered substantially limiting .
