operational policy issues include congressional notification , legal considerations , and current and future military activities .
issues and questions related to the killing of osama bin laden ( obl ) are multifaceted and may have operational , regional , and policy implications .
the killing of obl nearly 10 years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the united states poses many questions about the continuing destructive capabilities of aq , the effects on regional affiliates , and u.s. policy implications in pakistan and afghanistan .
in the wake of obl's death , many practitioners and observers have expressed interest in the implications for u.s. national security strategy — whether and to what extent the u.s. government's prioritization of ct relative to other national security imperatives , the distribution of ct efforts among u.s. government agencies , and the relative balance of emphasis between ct and other concerns within key u.s. government agencies , ought to be adjusted .
such decision - making is likely to be shaped in part by assessments of the impact that obl's death has on the aq organization and its affiliates , by developments and considerations concerning other key u.s. national security interests , and by the current climate of relatively constrained resources .
the national security community may seek to revise foreign policy and counterterrorism priorities while pursing actions to limit the possible threats to u.s. interests resulting from obl's death .
near - and long - term security and foreign policy considerations may be reassessed with the killing of obl .
the department of defense's ( dod's ) 2010 quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) recognizes a military role , naming "succeed[ing] in counterinsurgency , stability , and counterterrorism operations" as one of dod's six key missions .
the 2010 national security strategy ( nss ) repeatedly underscores the importance of the mission to "disrupt , dismantle and defeat al qaeda and its violent extremist affiliates in afghanistan , pakistan , and around the world. .
key factors — about which assessments are likely to differ — include not only whether the threat has diminished ( or grown ) ; but also how and in what ways the threat may have changed qualitatively .
the state department's first quadrennial diplomacy and development review ( qddr ) , also released in 2010 , stresses that "the threat of terrorism and violent extremism has become more acute and more immediate," and it argues that countering that threat is not exclusively a military responsibility , but rather one shared by multiple agencies .
while countering violent extremist threats is understood to be important , existing unclassified strategic guidance does not make clear how important that mission is compared to other key missions .
in addition , there is a generally shared understanding among practitioners that multiple u.s. government agencies share responsibility for the mission to disrupt and defeat violent extremist organizations ( veos ) .
that mandate has been understood to include a broad range of activities including — according to the nss — protecting the homeland , securing weapons of mass destruction , denying safe havens , and building partnerships around the world .
dod's current unclassified guidance does not prioritize .
