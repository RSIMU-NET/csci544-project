the initial planning for nextgen focused on implementing improvements through 2025 , but more recently the federal aviation administration ( faa ) has emphasized improvements that can be implemented in the midterm , defined as between 2012 and 2018 .
nextgen improvements have been planned over a long horizon .
these improvements are intended to improve the efficiency and capacity of the air transportation system while maintaining its safety so that it can accommodate this anticipated future growth .
we group these challenges into three areas: ( 1 ) directing resources and addressing environmental issues to ensure the timely implementation of capabilities , ( 2 ) adjusting faa's culture and business practices to support the implementation of operational improvements , and ( 3 ) developing and implementing cost - effective options to encourage airlines and general aviation operators to equip their aircraft with nextgen technologies .
nextgen improvements include new integrated systems , procedures , aircraft performance capabilities , and supporting infrastructure needed for a performance - based air transportation system that uses satellite - based surveillance and navigation and network - centric operations .
the task force also made four overarching recommendations to ( 1 ) work toward closer adherence to current separation standards ( criteria for spacing between aircraft ) , ( 2 ) establish incentives that will ensure a return on investment for those wishing to install new technology and equipment on aircraft , ( 3 ) streamline the operational approval process that ensures the safety of equipment and the training of those that use the equipment in the national airspace system , and ( 4 ) follow up on and track recommendations to ensure their implementation .
these problems have occurred even though air traffic has declined during the current recession , and they are expected to worsen as the economy recovers and air traffic increases .
faa is now considering how it will modify its nextgen implementation plan in response to the task force's recommendations and do so in a way that retains safety as the highest priority .
on september 9 , 2009 , the task force issued its final report , which contained a list of recommendations to implement operational capabilities in five key areas — surface operations , runway access , congestion relief in metropolitan areas , cruise operations , and access to certain airspace — and two cross - cutting areas — data communication applications and integrated air traffic management .
recognizing the importance of near - term and midterm solutions , faa requested that rtca , inc. — a private , not - for - profit corporation that develops consensus - based recommendations on communications , navigation , surveillance , and air traffic management system issues — create a nextgen midterm implementation task force ( referred to in this statement as the task force ) to reach consensus within the aviation community on the operational improvements that can be implemented between now and 2018 .
thus far in 2009 more than one in five airline flights have been delayed or canceled .
today's air transportation system is straining to meet current demands .
additionally , many stakeholders have concluded that more can and must be done in the near term — generally thought of as between now and 2012 — to address inefficiencies and delays in the system .
