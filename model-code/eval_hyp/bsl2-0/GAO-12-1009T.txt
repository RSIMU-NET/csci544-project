fema has taken initial steps to develop measures to assess the effectiveness of its grant programs , but it does not have a plan and related milestones for implementing measures specifically for the port security grant program .
dhs is the lead federal agency responsible for implementing mtsa requirements and it relies on a number of its component agencies that have responsibilities related to maritime security , as follows .
our work has shown that dhs and its component agencies — particularly the coast guard and cbp — have made substantial progress in implementing various programs that , collectively , have improved maritime security .
federal emergency management agency ( fema ) : fema is responsible for administering grants to improve the security of the nation's highest risk port areas .
in general , our maritime security - related work has addressed four areas: ( 1 ) national and port - level security planning , ( 2 ) port facility and vessel security , ( 3 ) maritime domain awareness and information sharing , and ( 4 ) international supply chain security .
prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , federal attention at ports tended to focus on navigation and safety issues , such as dredging channels and environmental protection .
without such performance measures it could be difficult for fema to effectively manage the process of assessing whether the program is achieving its stated purpose of strengthening critical maritime infrastructure against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks .
another challenge that dhs and its component agencies have faced in implementing maritime security - related programs has been the lack of adequate performance measures .
we recommended that dhs develop a plan with milestones for implementing performance measures for the port security grant program .
november 2012 will mark the 10th anniversary of the enactment of mtsa , which requires a wide range of security improvements designed to help protect the nation's ports , waterways , and coastal areas from terrorist attacks by requiring a wide range of security improvements .
similarly , fema has experienced difficulties developing outcome - based performance measures .
my statement today summarizes our work on maritime security since the enactment of mtsa and is focused on progress the federal government has made in improving maritime security , and key challenges that dhs and its component agencies have encountered in implementing maritime security - related programs .
balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the free flow of people and commerce remains an ongoing challenge for the public and private sectors alike .
for example , in november 2011 we reported that fema was developing performance measures to assess its administration of the port security grant program , but had not implemented measures to assess the program's grant effectiveness .
in general , these challenges are related to ( 1 ) program management and implementation ; ( 2 ) partnerships and collaboration ; ( 3 ) resources , funding , and sustainability ; and ( 4 ) performance measures .
ports , waterways , and vessels handle billions of dollars in cargo annually , and an attack on our nation's maritime transportation system could have dire consequences .
we were unable to identify all federal spending for these purposes , but were able to estimate obligations or expenditures for certain programs .
