the federal government has provided this funding through the fcc's universal service fund ( usf ) and the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) rural utilities service ( rus ) .
rus's programs focus on rural telecommunications development , while usf's programs focus on providing support for areas where the cost of providing services is high , as well as for low - income consumers , schools , libraries , and rural health care facilities .
from fiscal years 2010 to 2014 , the federal government provided over $33 billion in assistance to telecommunications service providers and municipalities to build or improve networks in order to further the national goal of universal high - speed internet access .
in addition , we evaluated usf and rus program coordination based on criteria for implementing interrelated programs developed in previous gao work on fragmentation , overlap , duplication , and interagency coordination within the federal government .
my statement , like the report , examines ( 1 ) perspectives of selected tribes and providers on the importance of high - speed internet access for tribes and any barriers to increasing this access on tribal lands ; ( 2 ) the level of interrelation and coordination between federal programs at fcc and usda that promote high - speed internet access on tribal lands ; and ( 3 ) existing data and fcc performance goals and measures related to access to high - speed internet service on tribal lands and for tribal institutions .
finally , to determine what data and fcc performance goals and measures exist related to access to high - speed internet service on tribal lands and to tribal institutions , we analyzed fiscal year 2010 through 2014 data from usf programs providing assistance , reviewed applications and the guidance materials for those programs , and the agencies' performance reports .
we also identified and interviewed industry stakeholders such as research groups and telecommunications associations on their views regarding the barriers to increasing high - speed internet access to broadband on tribal lands .
in addition , federal communications commission ( fcc ) data indicates that , as of december 2013 , high - speed internet was available to 37 percent of households on tribal lands — compared to 47 percent of u.s. households in rural areas and 92 percent of u.s. households in urban areas .
fcc agreed with our recommendation and intends to provide guidance to applicants in fiscal year 2017. develop performance goals and measures to track progress on achieving its strategic objective of ensuring that all tribal schools and libraries have affordable access to modern broadband technologies .
advances in technology , attained through the use of fiber optics and new wireless technologies have allowed providers to offer high - speed internet that supports new services and applications such as streaming video .
my statement today is based on our january 2016 report ( gao - 16-222 ) on tribal high - speed internet access .
native americans are among the most economically distressed groups in the united states and , according to the census' 2014 american community survey ( acs ) , about 28.3 percent live in households with incomes below the federal poverty level — compared to 15.5 percent for the u.s. population as a whole .
