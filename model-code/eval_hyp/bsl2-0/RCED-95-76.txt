every year , millions of pounds of food is damaged or contaminated as a result of mishandling , accidents , or disasters , such as floods or fires .
concerned about the efforts made to salvage the food after the fire , you asked us to review federal and state regulation of the food salvaging industry .
as agreed with your office , we have ( 1 ) described the events surrounding the americold fire , particularly the disposition of the food removed from the storage facility , and ( 2 ) identified lessons learned from this incident that could be used to improve federal and state regulation of food salvaging .
such a disaster occurred in december 1991 , when an underground fire potentially contaminated about 245 million pounds of food in the americold storage cave in kansas city , kansas .
we recommend that fda more actively assist states in managing food salvaging operations following major disasters .
at a minimum , fda should ensure that ( 1 ) the information it has about private food testing laboratories and key personnel is communicated to state officials responsible for monitoring food salvaging operations after a major disaster and ( 2 ) these state officials are made aware of fda's guidance for maintaining the integrity of the food sampling process .
over the years , fda has developed considerable nationwide experience and expertise in food safety .
according to fda officials , state and local authorities are the most effective regulatory bodies for monitoring such operations because ( 1 ) fda has no authority to place an embargo on hazardous food ; ( 2 ) the states have intensive regulatory coverage of food warehouses and retail establishments , where most food salvaging operations occur ; and ( 3 ) fda has concentrated its resources on issues that pose a higher risk to public health , such as monitoring the blood supply and the safety of medical devices .
we believe that in future disasters of this magnitude , in which so much is at stake and improper decisions can adversely affect food safety , fda should proactively draw upon this expertise and provide stronger leadership in working with states to maintain the safety of the food supply .
both fda and the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) are responsible for ensuring that all food shipped or received in interstate commerce is safe for consumption .
both of these problems suggest the need for fda to be more proactive in helping states manage food salvaging following major disasters .
kdhe relied on fda , which has considerable experience in dealing with food safety issues , for advice and guidance .
usda directly monitors meat and poultry salvaging operations using its own inspectors or designates states to perform inspections when they have inspection programs that meet requirements at least equal to federal laws .
however , fda's operational procedures state that in unusual circumstances , such as those involving the interstate movement of merchandise or areas in which state or local political ramifications are anticipated , fda may assume the primary role in overseeing salvaging operations .
during the storage and distribution of the billions of pounds of food consumed annually in the united states , some food is damaged or contaminated because of mishandling , accidents ( e.g. , fires , explosions , or truck and train accidents ) , or natural and man - made disasters ( e.g. , earthquakes , hurricanes , floods , or riots ) .
