our review focused on reconstruction - related contract actions by the department of defense ( dod ) ( primarily the u.s. army , including the army corps of engineers ) , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the department of state through september 30 , 2003 .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine whether agencies had complied with applicable laws and regulations governing competition in awarding new contracts and issuing task orders under existing contracts , and ( 2 ) evaluate agencies' initial efforts in carrying out contract administration tasks .
since april 2003 , congress has appropriated more than $20 billion to support rebuilding efforts such as restoring iraq's oil and electric infrastructures ; reconstituting iraq's national army and local police forces ; assisting in developing a market - based economy ; and improving the country's health , education , and medical services .
this complex undertaking , which is occurring in an unstable security environment and under significant time constraints , is being carried out largely through contracts with private - sector companies .
given the widespread congressional interest in ensuring that reconstruction contracts are awarded properly and administered effectively , we initiated a review of the contracts awarded to rebuild iraq .
the coalition provisional authority ( cpa ) , an entity established to manage iraqi affairs on a temporary basis , is overseeing the rebuilding effort .
the united states , along with its coalition partners and various international organizations and donors , has embarked on a significant effort to rebuild iraq in the aftermath of the war that replaced that country's regime .
many of these contract actions were awarded on behalf of the cpa , especially by the army , which acted as the cpa's executive agent .
staffing constraints and security concerns posed further challenges .
however , recent congressional action requiring the cpa administrator and heads of federal agencies to report on contracts awarded using other than full and open competition will provide more transparency and accountability in the award of new iraq reconstruction contracts .
until agreement is reached , contract incentives to control costs are likely to be less effective .
nevertheless , timely definitization of outstanding contracts and task orders is needed to promote effective cost control .
agencies have made progress in addressing these issues , but there remains a backlog of contracts for which final agreement has not yet been reached .
it is too early to gauge whether the cpa approach to improving its ability to monitor and coordinate reconstruction efforts through the use of a new program management office and the planned award of various types of construction and management support contracts will be effective .
in november 2003 , congress appropriated an additional $18.4 billion for rebuilding activities .
ensure that any future task orders under the logcap contract for iraq reconstruction activities are within the scope of that contract .
address and resolve all outstanding issues in connection with the pending justifications and approvals for the contracts and related task orders used by the army corps of engineers to restore iraq's electricity infrastructure .
to ensure that task orders issued to rebuild iraq comply with applicable requirements , and to maximize incentives for the contractors to ensure effective cost control , we recommend that the secretary of the army take the following four actions: review the out - of - scope task orders for iraqi media and subject matter experts issued by the defense contracting command - washington and take any necessary remedial actions .
