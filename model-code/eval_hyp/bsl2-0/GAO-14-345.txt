since 1970 , the federal government has paid more than $45 billion in benefits to miners totally disabled by respiratory diseases ( or to their survivors ) , including cwp , through the black lung benefits program .
in october 2010 , the department of labor's ( dol ) mine safety and health administration ( msha ) — the federal agency responsible for setting and enforcing mine safety and health standards — proposed lowering the existing concentration limit for respirable coal mine dust from 2.0 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air ( mg / m ) to 1.0 mg / m in commenting on the proposed rule , representatives of the coal mining industry raised concerns about the feasibility and cost of reducing respirable coal mine dust concentrations to the proposed limit of 1.0 mg / m consistent with this requirement , in august 2012 , we issued a report in which we assessed the strengths and limitations of the data and the analytical methods msha used to support its proposal to lower the exposure limit for coal mine dust .
cwp has been the underlying or contributing cause of death for more than 75,000 coal miners since 1968 , according to the department of health and human services' national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , the federal agency responsible for conducting research on work - related diseases and injuries and recommending occupational safety and health standards .

in that report , we concluded that the evidence msha used supported its conclusion that lowering the exposure limit as proposed would reduce miners' risk of disease .
in may 2013 , you requested that we conduct an additional analysis of the data msha used to support its proposal and provide information on existing technologies that could be used to reduce dust levels in coal mines .
to what extent did msha use recent cwp trend data as a basis for its proposed exposure limit on coal mine dust ? .
any additional recent studies on the prevalence of coal worker respiratory diseases and reviewed additional information on the strengths and limitations of cwp trend data .
what are experts' views on ways to lower the level of dust in coal mines , including their associated advantages , disadvantages , and cost ? .
coal mine dust is one of the most serious occupational hazards in the coal mining industry , and overexposure can cause coal workers' pneumoconiosis ( cwp ) and a number of other lung diseases collectively referred to as black lung disease .
in this report , we address the following questions: 1 .
to gather experts' views on the options that exist to lower the level of dust in coal mines and their associated advantages , disadvantages , and cost , we worked with the national academies to convene a group of experts that included mine operators , equipment manufacturers , researchers , and other stakeholders .
for more details on our scope and methodology , see appendix i .
we conducted this performance audit from july 2013 to april 2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
