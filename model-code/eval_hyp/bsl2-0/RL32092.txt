some attention has beengiven to insurance market reforms .
 ( 3 ) all of thesebills focus on tort reform as the solution to increasing malpractice premiums .
 ( 1 ) most of the discussion about the rising cost of malpracticeinsurance has centered on limiting the damage awards in malpractice suits .
but the controversy over damage awards eclipsed thoseother topics , and subsequent state and federal legislative activity centered on reforming malpracticetort law .
another spate of malpractice tort reforms were proposed and debated , separate fromthe proposals related to health care quality and the mostly academic discussions concerning patientsafety .
 ( 4 ) the separation of patient safety concerns from medical malpractice issues has not alwaysbeen the case .
during the first malpractice insurance "crisis" in the mid - late 1970s , california passeda pioneering bill , the medical injury compensation reform act ( micra ) , which includedprovisions not only limiting damage awards and other legal reforms , but also strengthening patientsafety and physician disciplinary activities .
5 / s. 354 , the help efficient , accessible,low - cost , timely healthcare ( health ) act of 2005 ; s. 22 , the medical care accessprotection act of 2006 ; and s. 23 , the healthy mothers and healthy babies access tocare act .
a third , related area that has received less consideration inmalpractice discussions is patient safety .
legislationconsidered during the 109th congress has been no exception .
 ( 2 ) while patient safety and medical errors have generated a great dealof discussion in the media and in legislatures in the past several years , such discussion typically hastaken place separately from the vigorous debates concerning malpractice litigation .
intrinsic to patient safety efforts are strategies toprevent medical errors ; i.e. , the use of an incorrect medical treatment or the failure of a specifictreatment to achieve the intended result .
patient safety refers to the panoply of rules , practices , and systems related to the preventionof patient injury , also known as "adverse events. .
medical malpractice and malpractice insurance continue to be issues of great concern tophysicians , consumers , legislators , and others .
individual initiatives have resulted in promisingoutcomes , but the overall impact of these efforts has been mixed .
since publication of that report , the intense media attention helpedpropel patient safety issues to the forefront of health care debates and legislative proposals .
however , medical liability issues are addressed in otherlegislation - - specifically , h.r .
to some degree , this is the casebecause implementation has not been as pervasive as initial intentions suggested , and also becausenot enough research has been done to identify , enumerate , and assess patient safety efforts .
giventhe interest in patient safety and observations by some that the nation is in the midst of its thirdmalpractice insurance "crisis," some federal and state legislators have developed proposals to addressthese issues .
through most of the 1990s , patient safety issues did not command widespread legislativeattention , despite research that found that medical errors caused significant health and financialproblems for the individuals injured , their families , and the nation as a whole .
this dynamic was repeated during the second malpractice insurance "crisis" during themid - late 1980s .
