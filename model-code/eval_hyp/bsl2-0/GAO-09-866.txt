recently , concerns have surfaced about some drugs which fda approved based on surrogate endpoints .
regardless of whether a postmarketing study has been required or requested by fda , sponsors conducting such studies must comply with provisions in the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 ( fdama ) and implementing regulations to report annually to fda on the status of postmarketing studies .
while fda has long accepted surrogate endpoints to support drug approval , the use of such endpoints can be controversial .
the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is the federal agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical products , including drugs and biological products .
for example , in 2008 fda approved the drug avastin to treat breast cancer based on its ability to limit tumor growth ; however , studies used to support approval also showed that the drug did not improve overall survival .
in addition , under both the accelerated and traditional approval processes , fda may request — and sponsors may agree — to conduct additional postmarketing studies to address other matters that fda has determined are worthy of further examination .
although the use of surrogate endpoints can expedite drug approvals , it can also add uncertainty when the relationship between a surrogate endpoint and clinical benefit or endpoint has not been fully established .
in 1992 fda established an accelerated approval process to expedite the approval of applications for certain new drugs that are designed to treat serious or life - threatening illnesses and which are expected to provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapy .
because fda's approval of a drug based on these surrogate endpoints rarely establishes the drug's clinical benefits in relation to a clinical endpoint , fda has developed additional regulatory requirements when sponsors use surrogate endpoints under the accelerated process .
despite the potential benefits of using surrogate endpoints , reliance on these endpoints may introduce uncertainty regarding the risks and benefits of a drug , and may lead to the adoption of useless or even harmful therapies .
in contrast , under the traditional process — by which fda reviews most drugs — fda recognizes the surrogate endpoints as valid substitutes for clinical endpoints , and thus there are no such postmarketing study requirements .
in this report we: 1. identify applications fda has approved based on surrogate endpoints through its accelerated approval process , including the surrogate 2. endpoints used for approval , as well as the status of any associated postmarketing studies ; identify applications fda has approved for selected new drugs based on surrogate endpoints in its traditional approval process , including the surrogate endpoints used for approval , as well as the status of any associated postmarketing studies ; and 3. evaluate fda's oversight of postmarketing studies .
due to the need to expedite approval of such drugs , under this process , fda may accept , as a basis for approval , evidence that demonstrates the drug's impact on surrogate endpoints which are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit , and have not yet been demonstrated to be valid substitutes for clinical endpoints .
