congress has shaped u.s. engagement with niger and the u.s. military footprint in the country through its authorization and appropriation of funding for u.s. security cooperation and assistance programs , and through its authorization of funding for u.s. military construction .
congressional committees of jurisdiction have also influenced u.s. policy and programs in niger through oversight activities , for example probing the capacity of fragile states such as niger to absorb u.s. counterterrorism assistance and directing dod to seek to mitigate associated risks ( see " for what purposes are u.s. military personnel in niger ? .
for many members of congress , the incident has thrown a spotlight on evolving security threats in west africa's central sahel region , as well as the growing presence of u.s. military forces engaged in counterterrorism support in africa and throughout the world .
" ) .
those issues , among others , are the subject of ongoing dod and fbi investigations , and are beyond the scope of this report .
the defense department ( dod ) has stated that the u.s. servicemembers were "conducting an advise and assist mission" to conduct reconnaissance with nigerien counterparts , several of whom were also killed and injured .
niger's relative stability , willingness to partner with western militaries , and close historic relationship with former colonial power france have made it an attractive partner for the u.s. military and a useful location from which to conduct activities with a regional scope .
in response to heightened public attention to the circumstances of the october 4 incidents , many members of congress have noted unanswered questions about the precise nature of the dod mission that came under attack , commanders' determinations regarding the circumstances of the mission , and the timeline under which u.s. , french , and contractor - administered military assets responded to the attack .
this report provides background information and context on the u.s. military presence in niger , and several related issues , in response to frequently asked questions .
islamist extremists have , however , killed western civilians , including a handful of u.s. citizens , in a series of mass - casualty attacks in north and west africa since 2013 ( see chronology in the appendix ) .
u.s. officials have stated that a local group affiliated with the islamic state ( is , aka isis / isil ) was responsible for the attack , which would make it the first known incident in which an islamist militant group in the sahel has killed u.s. soldiers on active duty .
on october 4 , four members of u.s. special operations forces were killed and two wounded in an attack near the town of tongo tongo in western niger ( figure 1 , below ) .
the first u.s. citizen reportedly held as a hostage for a prolonged period by an islamist group in the sahel was kidnapped in western niger in october 2016 ; some news reports suggest that he is being held by the same group that carried out the october 4 , 2017 , attack , but this has not been confirmed .
the u.s. military presence in niger has grown significantly since 2002 , when the george w. bush administration first launched an initiative to build the capacity of niger and neighboring countries to counter terrorism , and since 2013 , when president obama reported to congress the deployment to niger of some 100 military personnel for intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ) activities .
