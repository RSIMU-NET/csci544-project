some experts argue that china's rise poses serious challenges to u.s. interests , while others believe that its implications are limited and that u.s. strengths remain formidable .
it maintains robust , formal alliances in europe and asia , and far outweighs china in military spending and capabilities .
the united states exceeds the people's republic of china ( prc ) in global trade , and far surpasses china in gdp and foreign direct investment .
however , many analysts contend that u.s. soft power has declined in relative terms , and some studies show a dramatic loss in global confidence in the united states' foreign policies .
despite this development , the united states remains the preeminent global force in many areas of soft power .
it continues to be the dominant external political and military actor in the middle east and political and economic influence in latin america .
in the past decade , china's "soft power" — global influence attained through diplomatic , economic , cultural , and other non - coercive means — has grown along with its international standing .
while the challenge of china's soft power does not alter vital u.s. interests , it affects the ways and means the united states uses to protect its interests and attain its strategic goals .
the bush administration's five - year , $15 billion president's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) reportedly has helped to bolster public opinion in favor of the united states in africa while humanitarian assistance in places such as indonesia also have helped to boost u.s. standing .
by contrast , the united states , particularly since 2001 , has focused upon longer - term goals of combating terrorism as well as promoting democratic governance and market - oriented economic development .
the 110 th congress has held hearings and proposed measures that support u.s. public diplomacy , diplomatic efforts , and foreign aid .
regarding china's goals , some observers contend that china's most pressing concerns , at least in the short - to medium - term , are domestic ( focused on economic growth and social stability ) .
many countries continue to seek strong diplomatic , economic , and security relations with the united states even while cultivating ties with china .
however , many countries have not benefitted from counter - terrorism , pepfar , or millennium challenge account ( mca ) assistance .
this rapid and sustained economic growth has created voracious domestic appetites for resources , capital , and technology .
it compares u.s. and prc efforts in a range of areas , including educational and cultural exchanges , bilateral and multilateral diplomacy , and foreign aid funding and approaches .
many of these activities are tied to prc pledges of foreign aid .
furthermore , this argument goes , u.s. military might , foreign aid resources , trade and foreign direct investment , and intellectual and cultural influences remain formidable .
however , concerns about china's military strength are evident in europe , japan , and south korea .
others argue that china's rise is limited in scope , vulnerable to domestic shocks and public backlash in foreign countries , and represents a trend toward greater integration in the global community .
