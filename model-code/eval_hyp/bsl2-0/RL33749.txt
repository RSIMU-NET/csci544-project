 ( 7 ) the nclb , with its numerous new or substantially expanded requirements for participating states and leas , initiated a major increase in federal involvement in basic aspects of public k - 12 education .

as with the nclb , efforts to sustain or expand outcome accountability requirements are likely to be coupled with efforts to increase state and local flexibility in other respects , particularly with respect to how federal aid funds may be used .
efforts might be devoted to ways to enhance the transparency and consistency of future esea implementation activities â€” for example , through increased public dissemination of information on policies proposed by states and ed's responses to those proposals .
