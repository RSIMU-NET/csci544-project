as required by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 ( mippa ) , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) recently implemented several changes to the way medicare pays for dialysis care , including the introduction of a low - volume payment adjustment ( lvpa ) for services furnished on or after january 1 , 2011 , to increase the payment rate for facilities that provide a low volume of dialysis treatments .
low - volume providers in areas where other care options are limited may warrant higher payments because , if medicare's payment methods did not account for these providers' higher costs of care , beneficiary access to care could be reduced if these providers were unable to continue operating .
medicare's payment adjustment for low - volume dialysis facilities is one of several modifications in medicare's various payment systems designed to help maintain beneficiaries' access to care .
providers that furnish a low volume of services may incur higher costs of care because they cannot achieve the economies of scale that are possible for larger providers .
in contrast , low - volume providers that are in close proximity to other providers may not warrant an adjustment because beneficiaries have other care options nearby .
mippa required us to conduct a study of the lvpa.the committees of jurisdiction , this report: ( 1 ) examines the design of the adjustment and the extent to which it targeted low - volume facilities that appeared necessary for ensuring access to care and had high costs ; and ( 2 ) examines how cms implemented the lvpa , including the extent to which cms paid the 2011 adjustment to facilities that were eligible to receive it .
most individuals with esrd are eligible for medicare regardless of their age .
in 2011 , medicare spent about $10.1 billion on dialysis care — including dialysis treatments and related items and services — for about 365,000 beneficiaries .
these payment modifications include those that were developed to target small and geographically isolated providers .
these overpayments primarily stemmed from unclear and untimely cms guidance and persisted because of cms's insufficient monitoring of medicare contractors .
providers are allowed to define their own cost - reporting year ; for example , cost reports may span from january 1 through december 31 or july 1 through june 30. eligible facilities with the average cost per treatment for facilities overall , we analyzed data from 2010 medicare cost reports for freestanding facilities and adjusted those costs for differences in wages and beneficiaries' health status .
to examine the extent to which the 2011 lvpa targeted low - volume facilities that appeared necessary for ensuring access to care and had high costs , we used three different medicare data sources — claims data , cost reports , and the dialysis facility compare ( dfc ) database .
medicare - certified providers are required to submit an annual cost report to medicare contractors .
mippa required that the adjustment reflect the extent to which costs incurred by low - volume facilities exceed the costs incurred by other facilities and authorized cms to define the level at which a facility's treatments are considered low volume and to determine the amount of the adjustment .
