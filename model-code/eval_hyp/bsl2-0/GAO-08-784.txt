we met with u.s. government officials from ondcp ; the departments of defense ( defense ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , justice ( justice ) , and state ; and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .
specifically , we examined: ( 1 ) how u.s. agencies have assisted these countries in their efforts to disrupt drug trafficking and what results this assistance has yielded , and ( 2 ) the factors that have impeded counternarcotics efforts in these countries .
from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2007 , the united states provided over $950 million to directly or indirectly support counternarcotics activities in transit zone countries , excluding mexico .
according to the department of state's ( state ) international narcotics control strategy report , u.s. assistance is intended to help nations become “full and self - sustaining partners” in the international counternarcotics effort .
as a result , the united states has assisted nations in the region to strengthen their law enforcement , judicial , military , and other sectors .
we did not include mexico because we reported on u.s. counternarcotics assistance to that country in 2007 .
we also reviewed estimates of illicit drug flow and data on seizures and disruptions of drug trafficking operations .
to address these objectives , we analyzed program data and documentation relating to counternarcotics efforts in eight countries within the transit zone designated by the president as major drug transit countries — the bahamas , the dominican republic , ecuador , guatemala , haiti , jamaica , panama , and venezuela — from 2003 through 2007 .
as requested , we examined u.s. counternarcotics assistance to selected countries in the transit zone since 2003 .
we also met with officials at the joint interagency task force - south and u.s. southern command in florida and traveled to four major drug transit countries ( the dominican republic , ecuador , guatemala , and panama ) to meet with u.s. embassy officials , host government officials , and local program beneficiaries .
as we have previously reported , countries in the transit zone have historically lacked the resources and institutional capacity to conduct counternarcotics operations .
one of the three priorities in the united states' national drug control strategy is to disrupt the illicit drug market by eradicating drug crops , interdicting illicit drugs in the transit zone , and attacking drug trafficking organizations .
while in country , we visited a number of project sites relating to maritime operations , port security , intelligence gathering , drug crop eradication , alternative development , and other activities .
the u.s. office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) reports that these organizations have smuggled between about 460 and 1,030 metric tons of cocaine through the transit zone to the united states annually since 2003 .
in recent years , ondcp has reported that about 90 percent of that cocaine has come to the united states through central america and mexico , while approximately 10 percent was trafficked through the caribbean .
the importation of illegal drugs , primarily cocaine , from countries in south america , continues to threaten the health and well - being of american citizens .
we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to provide an overall indication of the magnitude and nature of the illicit drug trade and interdiction efforts since 2003 .
