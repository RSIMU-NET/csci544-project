at your request , we examined ( 1 ) the federal role in supporting congestion pricing , ( 2 ) results of congestion pricing projects in the united states , and ( 3 ) emerging issues in congestion pricing projects .
metropolitan areas have also attempted to reduce congestion by managing existing infrastructure more efficiently , through traffic management strategies such as timed traffic signals , signs that warn drivers of congestion ahead , and improved responses to accidents .
metropolitan areas have undertaken several approaches to reduce congestion , but some approaches are becoming impractical and too costly .
concerns on the part of public and elected officials about the fairness of congestion pricing to all users have , however , been a challenge to instituting these projects .
for example , metropolitan areas have widened or extended roads to add physical capacity , yet this option may not be feasible in some densely populated urban areas or could have significant social and environmental impacts .
furthermore , adding roadway capacity is costly at a time when governments at all levels are facing fiscal constraints .
another strategy to reduce congestion is road pricing or congestion pricing — assessing tolls that vary with the level of congestion and time of day .
since the first u.s. congestion pricing project opened in 1995 , 19 project sponsors , generally state departments of transportation or local authorities , have 41 pricing projects either operational or under construction — primarily charging solo drivers to pay a toll on newly constructed lanes , existing carpool lanes , or charging a lower toll on tolled highways , bridges , and tunnels during off - peak periods .
other strategies , such as carpool or bus - only lanes , have been designed to reduce the number of vehicles on roadways by encouraging people not to drive alone .
as traffic has risen dramatically over the past 3 decades with population and economic growth , congestion now extends to more times of the day , more roads , and more cities and towns — thus affecting more people than ever before .
estimates of the cost of congestion vary ; according to the department of transportation ( dot ) , congestion costs america an estimated $200 billion each year in lost travel time and fuel , and drivers in metropolitan areas spent more than one - quarter of their total annual travel time in congested conditions .
to address these objectives , we reviewed relevant legislation , literature , reports , and studies .
we interviewed federal officials who oversee programs related to congestion pricing as well as experts in the field .
these evaluations of pricing projects address reservations we have about gaps in knowledge about such projects — for example , these evaluations will compare results across projects to assess the effectiveness of congestion reduction strategies and assess several measures of equity .
we analyzed congestion pricing project performance from evaluations , related environmental and traffic diversion assessments , traveler surveys , and interviews with state and local transportation officials who have implemented and evaluated projects .
many americans spend frustrating hours each year stuck in congested traffic , a situation that costs the country billions of dollars annually and influences people's decisions about where to live and work .
