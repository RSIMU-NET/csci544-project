in its 2010 financial statement , bp estimated the combined oil spill costs — cleanup , natural resource and economic damages , potential clean water act ( cwa ) penalties , and other obligations — will be approximately $41 billion .
this estimate includes payments made to date as well as projected future payments , such as claims .
the exxon valdez spill tallied approximately $2 billion in cleanup costs and $1 billion in natural resource damages in 1990 dollars .
however , bp acknowledges the difficulty in estimating some costs and does not include these costs in its projection .
an issue that has generated ( and to some degree continues to generate ) particular interest is the oil spill liability and compensation framework .
the incident received considerable attention in 2010 , highlighting multiple policy matters regarding oil spills and their aftermath .
the total costs of the 2010 gulf spill are projected to dwarf those of the exxon valdez .
therefore , this estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty .
these combined figures equate to approximately $5 billion in today's dollars and do not include the wider array of claims for which responsible parties are now liable .
this framework , which is grounded in federal statute and regulations , determines the following: 1. who is responsible for paying for oil spill cleanup costs ; 2. who is responsible for paying for economic and natural resource damages associated with an oil spill ; 3. how these costs and damages are defined ( i.e. , what is covered ) ; and 4. the degree to which ( or conditions in which ) the costs and damages are limited and / or shared by other parties , including general taxpayers .
although several companies were and are involved ( to varying degrees ) with the deepw ater horizon incident , bp was ( and continues to be ) the most prominent private party in oil spill response and compensation activities .
the united states has not encountered a spill comparable to the 2010 gulf spill since the 1989 exxon valdez in prince william sound , alaska .
the incident produced the largest oil spill that has occurred in u.s. waters , releasing more than 200 million gallons over approximately 84 days .
the third section discusses options for policymakers to adjust , amend , or supplement the current framework .
on april 20 , 2010 , the deepwater horizon oil drilling rig was nearing completion of bp's deepwater oil well when an uncontained release of hydrocarbons ( oil and natural gas ) caused explosions and fire , resulting in 11 crew member fatalities .
thus , for the purpose of this report , bp is discussed as if it is the sole responsible party — a key term in the existing liability and compensation framework .
the second section highlights many of the liability and compensation issues raised by the deepwater horizon event .
the first section of this report provides an overview of the existing liability and compensation framework .
president george h. w. bush signed into law the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa ) on august 18 , 1990 , consolidating existing federal oil spill laws , expanding authorities within the cwa , and creating new provisions regarding oil spill liability and compensation .
