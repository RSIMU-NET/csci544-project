other reasons are that dod has yet to institutionalize key system modernization management controls , and it has not demonstrated the ability to consistently deliver promised system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget .
our reasons include the modernization's large size , complexity , and critical role in addressing other long - standing transformation and financial management challenges .
nevertheless , dod continues to invest billions of dollars in thousands of business systems , including about a hundred that the department has labeled as business transformational programs , 12 of which account for about 50 percent of these programs' costs .
for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been challenged in modernizing its timeworn business systems .
the global combat support system - marine corps ( gcss - mc ) is one such program .
in 1995 , we designated dod's business systems modernization program as high risk and continue to do so today .
as envisioned , the program consists of a series of major increments , the first of which is expected to cost approximately $442 million and be fully deployed in fiscal year 2010 .
initiated in 2003 , gcss - mc is to modernize the marine corps logistics systems and thereby provide decision makers with timely and complete logistics information to support the warfighter .
as agreed , our objective was to determine whether the department of the navy is effectively implementing information technology ( it ) management controls on gcss - mc .
to accomplish this , we focused on the first increment of gcss - mc by analyzing a range of program documentation and interviewing cognizant officials relative to the following management areas: architectural alignment , economic justification , earned value management , requirements management , risk management , and system quality measurement .
these it acquisition management control weaknesses include compliance with dod's federated bea not being sufficiently expected costs not being reliably estimated ; earned value management not being adequately implemented ; system requirements not always being effectively managed , although this has recently improved ; key program risks not being effectively managed ; and key system quality measures not being used .
effective implementation of this framework can minimize program risks and better ensure that system investments are defined in a way to optimally support mission operations and performance , as well as deliver promised system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget .
thus far , gcss - mc has not been managed in accordance with key aspects of this framework , which has already contributed to more than 3 years in program schedule delays and about $193 million in cost increases .
by not effectively implementing these key it acquisition management controls , the program has already experienced sizeable schedule and cost increases , and it is at increased risk of ( 1 ) not being defined in a way that best meets corporate mission needs and enhances performance and ( 2 ) costing more and taking longer than necessary to complete .
dod it - related acquisition policies and guidance , along with other relevant guidance , provide an acquisition management control framework within which to manage business system programs like gcss - mc .
we conducted our performance audit from june 2007 to july 2008 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
