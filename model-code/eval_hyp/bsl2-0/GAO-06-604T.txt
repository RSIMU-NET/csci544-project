the services are currently funding their reset programs entirely through the use of supplemental appropriations , and plan to rely on supplemental appropriations for reset funding through at least fiscal year 2007 .
the fiscal year 2006 supplemental budget request includes $10.4 billion for equipment maintenance and reset .
the army estimates its total reset bill for fiscal year 2006 alone to be nearly $13.5 billion .
the uncertainties of how long ongoing operations will continue make it difficult to estimate future equipment reset costs .
equipment used in operations in iraq and afghanistan will eventually require more intensive repair and overhaul than what is typically expected in peacetime .
the marine corps has incurred a cost of more than $12 billion to date to reset equipment .
the overall condition of major equipment items at the end of these operations , although difficult to predict , will also be a significant factor affecting reset costs .
in addition to the billions of dollars already spent to maintain this well - worn equipment for ongoing operations , the army and marine corps will likely incur large expenditures in the future to repair or replace ( reset ) a significant amount of equipment when hostilities cease .
while combat units report high readiness rates , these reports reflect only that equipment is fully mission capable , meaning that the equipment has no critical or safety deficiencies as outlined in technical readiness reporting instructions .
furthermore , the affordability of these maintenance requirements will be an issue as the cost of these requirements compete for available funding in the future with other army and marine corps programs , as well as the overall department of defense budget .
these sustained operations are taking a toll on the condition and readiness of military equipment that , in some cases , is more than 20 years old .
age , along with the harsh environment in theater and combat conditions over long periods of time , magnifies an already growing problem of equipment repair , replacement , and procurement that existed even before the onset of combat operations in iraq and afghanistan .
however , equipment that is considered fully mission capable may have a number of deficiencies that will need to be addressed in the longer term .
this is not a conventional war against military forces of one country but an irregular war against terrorist cells with global networks , with operations currently centered in iraq and afghanistan .
specifically , it addresses the ( 1 ) environment , pace of operations , and operational requirements in southwest asia , and their effects on the army's and marine corps's equipping and maintenance strategies ; ( 2 ) equipment maintenance consequences and issues created by these equipping and maintenance strategies ; and ( 3 ) challenges affecting the timing and cost of army and marine corps equipment reset .
the united states is engaged in what the department of defense has termed the long war .
as requested , my testimony today will focus on the equipment maintenance and reset challenges facing the army and marine corps .
we welcome the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss a number of maintenance and equipment reset challenges facing the army and marine corps .
