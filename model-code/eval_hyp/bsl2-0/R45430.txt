since 2014 , congress has directed the u.s. department of state to report annually on mexico's deliveries and on efforts to improve mexico's treaty compliance .
this includes oversight of ibwc's actions to manage the colorado river's water and infrastructure to improve water availability during drought and to restore and protect riverine ecosystems .
on multiple occasions since 1994 , mexico has not met its rio grande water delivery obligations to the united states within the five - year period prescribed by the 1944 water treaty .
to date , congress has been involved in binational water sharing pursuant to the 1944 water treaty primarily through oversight .
in 1944 , the united states and mexico entered into the treaty on utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande ( hereinafter 1944 water treaty ) , which established the international boundary and water commission ( ibwc ) to oversee the u.s. - mexico border and water treaties .
the rio grande's headwaters are in the united states , its significant tributaries lie in both the united states and mexico , and its riverbed is the u.s. - mexico border in texas .
these shared surface waters , which are shown in table 1 , are important to many border community economies and water supplies .
although many of these disputes have related to state allocations within the united states , issues also have arisen between the united states and mexico over water quality , availability , and conservation .
this report examines binational sharing of the colorado river and the rio grande and addresses the evolution and framework of the ibwc and binational boundary and water treaties ; colorado river water sharing background and recent developments ; and rio grande water sharing background and recent developments .
appendix a provides detailed information regarding the reporting requirements established by congress for the rio grande in ill and report language since 2014 .
the united states and mexico share a nearly 2,000-mile border and multiple rivers , including the colorado river and the rio grande .
appendix b provides information on drought conditions in north america in recent years .
many of the estimates fell between 16 million af and 17 million af annually , although other estimates were higher and lower .
predominantly located in the united states , the colorado river crosses the u.s. - mexico border and empties into the gulf of california .
appendix c provides information on binational transboundary aquifers , which contain shared groundwater .
although discussion of colorado river water issues within the united states is beyond the scope of this report , concern about meeting future u.s. demands is significant to discussions about water sharing with mexico .
the study projected that the demand - supply imbalance would worsen in coming decades .
at the same time , natural flows from 2000 to 2016 ( i.e. , during the current ongoing drought ) were estimated to be 12.4 million af .
disputes have occurred over the use of colorado river water supplies for most of the past century .
since the 1.5 million af in flows reaching mexico generally has been a constant requirement since the 1944 water treaty , lower overall flows on the river mean the united states retains less of the river's natural flows than originally estimated .
