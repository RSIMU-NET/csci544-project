 ( 2 ) how does tsa deploy its tso allocation and what factors affect the model's effectiveness in helping tsa accomplish this deployment ? .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 , enacted in december 2004 , required tsa to develop and submit to the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation , and the house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure , standards for determining the aviation security staffing for all airports at which tsa provides or oversees screening services by march 2005 .
these standards are to provide the necessary levels of aviation security and ensure that the average aviation security related delay experienced by passengers is minimized .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act also mandated that we conduct an analysis of tsa's staffing standards .
tsa has identified its most important asset in accomplishing its mission as the tso workforce .
the aviation and transportation security act , enacted in november 2001 , established the transportation security administration ( tsa ) and significantly changed how passenger and checked baggage screening is conducted in the united states .
as a result , tsa hired and deployed about 55,000 federal passenger and baggage transportation security officers ( tso ) — formerly known as screeners — to more than 400 airports nationwide based largely on the number of screeners that the air carrier contractors had employed .
since august 2002 , however , tsa has been statutorily prohibited from exceeding 45,000 full - time equivalent positions available for screening .
tsa submitted these standards , which form the basis of tsa's staffing allocation model on june 22 , 2005 .
tsa's mission is to protect the nation's transportation systems while also ensuring the free movement of people and commerce .
to address our objectives , we reviewed tsa's report to the specified congressional committees on its staffing standards and technical materials detailing the staffing allocation model's assumptions , and analyzed relevant legislation .
to help accomplish its security mission , tsa has established standard operating procedures to ensure that every airline passenger and checked bag undergoes some level of scrutiny to help ensure that objects and devices that may threaten public safety are not taken onboard aircraft .
this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) how does tsa ensure that its staffing allocation model provides a sufficient number of tsos to perform passenger and checked baggage screening at each airport and what challenges has it faced while implementing the model ? .
the rapid changes in procedures stemming from the alleged august 2006 terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives onboard multiple commercial aircraft departing from the united kingdom and bound for the united states highlights the challenge tsa faces in balancing security with customer service and the vital role tsos play in ensuring the security of our commercial aviation system .
although , according to tsa officials , these security duties are the primary objective of its screening efforts , it also attempts to minimize the effect on the movement of people and commerce by seeking to keep wait times at airport checkpoints reasonable .
the purpose of this optimization model , as identified by tsa , is to estimate the most efficient balance of tsos needed to ensure security and minimize wait times .
