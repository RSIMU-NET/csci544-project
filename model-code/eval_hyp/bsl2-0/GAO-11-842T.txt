the office of management and budget ( omb ) has since issued updated guidance for federal agencies on reporting , reducing , and recovering improper payments .
in addition , the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 , contains provisions designed to help reduce improper payments in the medicare program .
ipera provisions generally became effective in fiscal year 2011 .
ipera , enacted july 22 , 2010 , amended ipia by expanding the previous requirements for identifying , estimating , and reporting on programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments and expanding requirements for recovering overpayments across a broad range of federal programs .
despite progress made by cms , reducing improper payments in the program is a continuing challenge for cms due to the size and scope of medicare .
the medicare improper payment estimates do not reflect all of the program's risk because hhs did not report a total improper payment estimated amount for its medicare prescription drug benefit program ( part d ) .
cms is the agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) responsible for administering the medicare program and leading efforts to reduce medicare improper payments .
ipia requires executive branch agencies to annually review all programs and activities to identify those that are susceptible to significant improper payments , estimate the annual amount of improper payments for such programs and activities , and report these estimates along with actions taken to reduce improper payments for programs with estimates that exceed $10 million .
today , my testimony will focus on two areas:  hhs reported estimated improper payments in the medicare program for fiscal year 2010 , and the status of cms's efforts to implement key strategies to help remediate improper payments in the medicare program .
fiscal year 2010 marked the 7th year of implementation of the improper payments information act of 2002 ( ipia ) .
for fiscal year 2010 , federal agencies reported an estimated $125.4 billion in improper payments , of which medicare accounts for nearly $48 billion — the highest estimated amount of improper payments in a single program .
my statement today is based primarily on previous gao reporting related to governmentwide improper payments , medicare high - risk challenges and program integrity efforts , and cms's information technology systems intended to help identify improper payments .
we supplemented that prior work with additional information on the nature and extent of medicare improper payments reported by hhs in its fiscal year 2010 agency financial report ( afr ) .
see appendix i for additional information about recent congressional and executive branch actions related to medicare improper payments .
as defined by the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 2010 ( ipera ) , an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount ( including overpayments and underpayments ) under statutory , contractual , administrative , or other legally applicable requirements .
gao has designated medicare as a high - risk program because of its size , complexity , and susceptibility to improper payments .
part d is the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit .
