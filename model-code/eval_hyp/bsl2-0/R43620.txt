the center - left government of president ernesto pérez balladares ( 1994-1999 ) of the former pro - noriega democratic revolutionary party ( prd ) implemented an economic reform program that included trade liberalization and privatization of state - owned enterprises .
the center - right arnulfista party government of president mireya moscoso ( 1999-2004 ) , panama's first female president , partially reversed the trade liberalization efforts of her predecessor .
panama's largely services - based economy has been booming in recent years , spurred on by the panama canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is expected to be completed in early 2016 .
this included the populist rule of general omar torrijos ( 1968-1981 ) , who initially governed as a social reformer , and the increasingly repressive rule of general noriega ( 1983-1989 ) .
the center - left prd government of president martín torrijos ( 2004-2009 ) , the son of the former military ruler , initiated the panama canal expansion project , negotiated a free trade agreement with the united states , and enacted judicial , penal , and anti - corruption reforms .
in the aftermath of the ouster of the noriega regime , the duly elected winner of the 1989 presidential election , guillermo endara ( 1989-1994 ) , took office ; his coalition government made significant progress in restoring functioning democratic political institutions , although the demilitarization process was difficult at times .
current president ricardo martinelli , elected in 2009 , remained generally popular during his presidency despite criticism at various junctures for his combative style of governing .
in the last year of his term , president martinelli remained broadly popular in large part because of the strong performance of the panamanian economy under his government buoyed by the ongoing canal expansion and other large infrastructure projects ( see " economic situation " below ) .
pérez balladares sought to amend the constitution to allow for presidential reelection , but panamanians rejected the proposal by a large margin in a national referendum .
the endurance of elected civilian democracy in panama for almost 25 years is a significant departure from the country's previous 21-year history of military rule .
since that time , the country has had five successive elected civilian governments , and a sixth is scheduled to assume power on july 1 , 2014 with the inauguration of current vice president juan carlos varela as president .
a central american nation with a population of about 3.8 million , panama has made notable political and economic progress since the december 1989 u.s. military intervention that ousted the military regime of general manuel antonio noriega from power .
current president ricardo martinelli , a businessman and former government minister from the small center - right democratic change ( cd ) party , defeated the prd candidate by a landslide in the may 2009 presidential election .
yet over the course of his tenure , martinelli's public approval ratings had dropped several times after strong public opposition and protests over some of his policy proposals related to labor issues , mining , and the sale of land in the colón free zone ( the world's second largest duty free zone after hong kong ) .
the government's challenges include efforts to combat poverty and inequality and to continue to make headway in combating threats from drug trafficking , money laundering , and organized crime .
