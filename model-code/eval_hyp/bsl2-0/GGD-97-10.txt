you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) issues surrounding whether there is a continuing need for the noaa and phs corps as uniformed services with military - like pay , allowances , and benefits and ( 2 ) what the costs would be if federal civilian employees carried out the corps' functions .
noaa corps officers carry out a variety of navigational and scientific functions , such as charting and oceanographic research .
noaa's commissioned corps is a uniformed service whose officers are covered by a military - like compensation system in a manner similar to the commissioned corps of the public health service ( phs ) .
our review did not examine whether the corps' functions or the number of persons used to accomplish those functions were necessary or could be changed as the result of civilianization .
in developing the information for this report , we interviewed — and analyzed documents provided by — officials of noaa , the noaa commissioned corps , the department of defense ( dod ) , the office of the navy oceanographer , the office of naval research , the national science foundation , and other organizations that could provide insights into the corps' functions , responsibilities , and costs .
this report responds to your request that we review the operations of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's ( noaa ) commissioned corps .
in general , the questions addressed why the noaa corps exists ; what the corps officers' duties are ; how the corps is similar to and different from the military ; and what savings , if any , might result from not using uniformed personnel to carry out current corps functions .
 ( 3 ) the amount of additional resources , if any , that would be required to administer the civilian workforce at noaa after civilianizing the corps and its administrative personnel .
appendix i describes in detail the objective , scope , and methodology of our review , which was done in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
 ( 2 ) what resources would be required to recruit , train , and retain civilian employees that might be needed to replace corps officers who opt to leave federal service .
a plan of action that addresses each of the above factors and other possible considerations would be needed before estimates of the transition costs involved could be determined .
in a may 7 , 1996 , report , we presented the results of our review of the phs corps .
the amount of transition costs would also depend on how considerations such as the following were resolved .
 ( 1 ) what retirement benefits or credits are given to officers for the time they spend in the corps before converting to civilian employment and the civilian employee retirement system .
we requested comments on a draft of this report from the departments of commerce and defense .
this report presents the results of our review of the noaa corps .
like the report on the phs corps , this report provides answers to questions your designated representative agreed would provide the information you were seeking .
the possibilities range from requiring all officers to immediately convert to civilian employment , to longer - range measures such as allowing all current officers to remain in place until retirement or other separation and requiring all new entrants to be civilian employees .
