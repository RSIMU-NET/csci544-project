to describe dod's extended health care benefit and va's health care services for oef / oif veterans , we reviewed dod policies and the educational materials dod provides to individuals on its health insurance benefits , including information on the length of coverage of these benefits .
in this report , we ( 1 ) describe dod's extended health care benefit for oef / oif veterans and va's health care services for oef / oif veterans ; ( 2 ) analyze dod data to determine the number of oef / oif servicemembers who may be at risk for developing ptsd and the number of these servicemembers who were referred for further mental health evaluations ; and ( 3 ) examine whether dod can provide reasonable assurance that oef / oif servicemembers who need further mental health evaluations receive referrals for these evaluations .
the ronald w. reagan national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 ( ndaa ) directed that we describe the mental health benefits available for oef / oif veterans .
dod provides mental health evaluations and treatment for ptsd to servicemembers , including oef / oif servicemembers , and the department also provides these mental health benefits for oef / oif veterans through an extended health care benefit created for this population .
the department of defense ( dod ) uses a questionnaire to screen oef / oif servicemembers after their deployment outside of the united states has ended .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) also provides mental health benefits to oef / oif veterans as part of health care services that it offers to these and other veterans .
mental health experts state that early identification and treatment of symptoms through education , peer and family support , therapy , or medications may lessen the severity of the condition and improve the overall quality of life for those with ptsd .
ndaa further directed that we examine the process dod uses to refer oef / oif servicemembers who need further mental health evaluations .
in addition , we reviewed va's policies , directives , and educational information on its health care services , including the mental health services that va has available for oef / oif veterans .
servicemembers returning from the military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq — operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , respectively — have engaged in intense and prolonged combat , which research has shown to be strongly associated with the risk for developing ptsd .
from among those who may be at risk for ptsd or other mental health conditions , these dod health care providers then determine which servicemembers need referrals for a further mental health evaluation .
we reviewed the types of mental health services available through va's health care system for oef / oif veterans .
ptsd can occur after experiencing or witnessing a life - threatening event and is the most prevalent mental health disorder resulting from combat .
we also interviewed dod officials and the military service branches about these benefits .
in conjunction with completion of the questionnaire , each oef / oif servicemember is interviewed by a dod health care provider who reviews the completed questionnaire and discusses with the servicemember any deployment - related health concerns , including mental health concerns .
