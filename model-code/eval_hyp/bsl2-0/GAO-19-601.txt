the bipartisan budget act of 2018 includes a provision for gao to study the impact or potential future impact of these third - party liability changes on both medicaid beneficiaries and providers .
in this report we 1. describe the status of selected states' implementation of third - party liability changes for state medicaid programs ; 2. evaluate cms's implementation and oversight of third - party liability changes for state medicaid programs ; and 3. describe stakeholders' views on the possible effects of third - party liability changes and the methods state medicaid program officials could use to monitor these changes .
to evaluate cms's implementation and oversight of third - party liability changes for state medicaid programs , we reviewed relevant laws and available guidance , including relevant regulations , cms's coordination of benefits and third - party liability ( cob / tpl ) in medicaid handbook , and an informational bulletin released on june 1 , 2018 , concerning cms's implementation of federal third - party liability requirements and agency oversight responsibilities regarding medicaid state plans and state plan amendments .
before the act , in the case of these three services , states were generally required to pay providers for services delivered to medicaid beneficiaries and then obtain any payments from liable third parties — a process known as “pay and chase.” the congressional budget office estimated that the bipartisan budget act of 2018 third - party liability changes would result in approximately $4 billion in federal savings from 2018 through 2027 .
we selected these states to include a range of characteristics such as the delivery systems of their medicaid programs ( e.g. , fee - for - service verses managed care ) , medicaid spending , percentage of births financed by medicaid , and third - party liability collections , and while also taking into consideration recommendations from background experts and national provider associations .
specifically , the act changed states' responsibilities for processing claims for three types of services: prenatal care services , pediatric preventive services , and services for children for whom child support enforcement ( cse ) is being carried out by the state ( also known as cse beneficiaries ) .
the changes pertaining to prenatal care services went into effect in february 2018 ; the changes related to pediatric services and services for cse beneficiaries go into effect in october 2019 .
the bipartisan budget act of 2018 made changes to the procedures state medicaid agencies must follow when they receive certain claims for which a third party might be liable , among other things .
throughout this report , we use the term “stakeholders” to refer collectively to officials from state medicaid agencies and medicaid mcos , background experts , beneficiary advocates , provider associations , and providers .
to describe the status of states' implementation of third - party liability changes , we judgmentally selected nine states: connecticut , florida , illinois , kentucky , nevada , new jersey , tennessee , texas , and utah .
such actions can include ensuring that state plans reflect the law .
we also conducted interviews with stakeholders from state chapters of the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , with two providers , with medicaid managed care organizations ( mco ) in three of our selected states , and with three groups advocating for the needs of medicaid beneficiaries .
