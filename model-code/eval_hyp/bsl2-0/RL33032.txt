such ayp models are not consistent with certain statutory provisions of the nclb , as they were originally interpreted by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) .
substantial interest has been expressed in the use of growth models to meet the ayp requirements of the nclb .
107-110 ) is that of adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) toward proficiency on state assessments .
schools or leas that fail to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years face a variety of consequences and , ultimately , corrective actions .
the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 , and the 111 th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea .
this report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments and available information .
in order to maintain eligibility for grants under esea title i , part a — grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) for the education of disadvantaged pupils , the largest federal k - 12 education program — states must establish and implement standards of ayp that are applicable to all public schools and leas in the state , as well as the state overall .
in november 2005 , the secretary of education announced a growth model pilot program under which up to ten states would be allowed to use growth models to make ayp determinations for the 2005-2006 school year .
in december 2007 , the secretary lifted the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model pilot , and regulations published in october 2008 incorporate this expanded policy .

thus far , the applications of 15 states — alaska , arkansas , arizona , colorado , delaware , florida , iowa , michigan , minnesota , missouri , north carolina , ohio , pennsylvania , tennessee , and texas — have been approved to participate in the pilot program .
why is there increased interest in growth models for determining ayp under nclb ? .
what might be the major advantages and disadvantages of growth models of ayp , in comparison to status or improvement models ? .
the no child left behind act statute , as implemented by ed currently , places primary emphasis on one of these models , while incorporating a second model as an explicitly authorized alternative .
in recent years , critics of current policy have increasingly focused their attention on a third model of ayp , which is the primary topic of this report .
growth models would likely increase the ability to attribute pupil achievement to their current school , as opposed to their past schools or background characteristics , especially ( but not only ) if controls ( and / or predicted growth elements ) are included in the model .
