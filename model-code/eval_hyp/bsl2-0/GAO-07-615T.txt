whether under its existing authority or using any additional flexibility that congress may grant , fha's ability to manage risks and program changes will affect the financial performance of the insurance program .
to help fha adapt to market changes , hud has proposed a number of changes to the national housing act that , among other things , would give fha flexibility to set insurance premiums based on the credit risk of borrowers and reduce down - payment requirements from the current 3 percent to potentially zero .
specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) weaknesses in how fha has managed the risks of loans with down - payment assistance , ( 2 ) practices that could be instructive for fha in managing the risks of new mortgage products , ( 3 ) fha's development and use of a mortgage scorecard , and ( 4 ) fha's estimation of subsidy costs for its single - family insurance program .
additionally , because of the worsening performance of the mortgages it insures , fha has estimated that the program would require a positive subsidy — that is , an appropriation of budget authority — in fiscal year 2008 if no program changes were made .
although fha has improved its ability to estimate the subsidy costs for its single - family insurance program , it generally has underestimated these costs .
according to fha's estimates , the insurance program currently operates with a negative subsidy , meaning that the present value of estimated cash inflows ( such as borrower premiums ) to fha's mutual mortgage insurance fund ( fund ) exceeds the present value of estimated cash outflows ( such as claims ) .
my testimony today discusses four reports that we have issued since 2005 on different aspects of fha's risk management , as well as ongoing work we are conducting on fha's proposed legislative changes and the tools and resources it would use to implement them , if passed .
for example , the agency has seen increased competition from conventional mortgage and insurance providers , many of which offer low - and no - down - payment products , and that may be better able than fha to identify and approve relatively low - risk borrowers .
in conducting this work , we reviewed and analyzed information concerning the standards and controls fha uses to manage the risks of loans with down - payment assistance ; steps mortgage industry participants take to design and implement low - and no - down - payment mortgage products ; fha's approach to developing its mortgage scorecard and the scorecard's benefits and limitations ; fha's estimates of program costs and the factors underlying the agency's cost reestimates ; and fha's plans and resources for implementing its proposed legislative changes .
but , the risks fha faces in today's mortgage market are growing .
this body of work addresses a number of issues relevant to fha's financial performance .
these trends created incentives and opportunities for borrowers to refinance using conventional loans .
to meet federal requirements , fha annually reestimates subsidy costs for each loan cohort .
in fiscal year 2006 , it insured about 426,000 mortgages , representing $55 billion in mortgage insurance .
