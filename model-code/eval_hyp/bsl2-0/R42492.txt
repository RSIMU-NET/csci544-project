major products include direct - to - home television ( $79.1 billion ) , satellite communications ( $17.3 billion ) , satellite radio ( $2.8 billion ) , consumer broadband ( $1.1 billion ) , and earth observation ( $1.0 billion ) .
u.s. commercial satellite manufacturing generated estimated revenues of $3.4 billion ( of $5.6 billion in total u.s. satellite manufacturing revenues ) and employed 26,611 private sector workers in 2010 , while the u.s. commercial launch industry generated revenues of $307 million ( of $1.2 billion in total u.s. launches ) and employed 49,195 private - sector workers .
in 2010 , global revenues from satellite - enabled activities ( i.e. , the commercial products and services that are created using satellites ) totaled $101.3 billion .
satellite services also generated worldwide sales of ground equipment that totaled $51.6 billion , including all of the infrastructure and technology needed to communicate with and manage satellites ( $7.5 billion ) , as well as all of the end - user consumer equipment ( satellite radios , satellite phones , satellite tv receivers and dishes , and satellite navigation equipment ) ( $44.1 billion ) .
because of its economic importance and its close link to government space programs , the u.s. space manufacturing industry has historically been of great interest to congress .
the united states also has a well - educated workforce and higher education system that is highly competitive internationally .
 ( see figure 1 . ) .
the u.s. commercial space manufacturing sector is small , but the companies that manufacture commercial satellites also manufacture satellites for the u.s. government .
military and civil ( i.e. , non - military government ) space programs provide economies of scale and scope to companies that are federal contractors .
as the u.s. government's role in promoting human spaceflight has transitioned from the space shuttle to a strategy that relies on the private sector to develop products that are competitive and serve the broad u.s. goals and activities that were identified in the national space policy of june 2010 , the u.s. launch industry has become dependent on government payloads and has continued to face stiff competition from russia and europe .
additionally , the united states is pursuing policies that support and encourage competition , and numerous entrepreneurial firms are investing and developing launchers and spacecraft that may open new avenues for space exploration and travel .
the focus of this report is the global commercial space manufacturing sector ( launch vehicles , spacecraft , satellites , and parts and equipment ) .
in 2010 , the united states commercial satellite industry launched a total of 34 satellites for commercial and government customers â€” more than russia ( 26 ) or europe ( 24 ) .
the commercial space sector overlaps the government ( civil and military ) space sector in a number of different ways .
the u.s. government is by far the largest consumer of space products and services , accounting for 23% of global spending .
it then lays out a number of federal policy issues that may affect the industry's growth .
orbital sciences corporation and space exploration technologies corporation ( spacex ) are two newer american companies that have successfully competed for commercial and government contracts .
