as shown in figure 1 , all common - law employers , including government entities ( such as federal , state , local , or indian tribal government entities ) , are responsible for annually determining whether they are considered an applicable large employer ( ale ) .
the employer shared responsibility provisions ( esrp ) of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
if an applicable large employer fails to offer health insurance or offers substandard coverage to its employees , that employer may be subject to a penalty .
111-148 , as amended ) generally incentivize large employers to offer adequate and affordable health insurance coverage to their full - time employees and their full - time employees' dependents .
an employer subject to the esrp is incentivized to offer adequate , affordable health insurance coverage to their full - time employees ( and their full - time employees' dependents ) .
if an employer does not offer such coverage , the employer risks being subject to a penalty if at least one full - time employee receives a premium tax credit or cost - sharing subsidy through a health insurance exchange ( exchange ) .
an ale is generally an employer that has at least 50 full - time employees ( including full - time equivalent employees , which are a representation of non - full - time employees as full - time employees ) .
if an employer does not qualify as an ale , then it will not be subject to the esrp , nor will it be at risk of a penalty for failing to offer health insurance coverage to its full - time employees .
it then discusses the two types of esrp penalties and introduces administrative aspects of the esrp .
this report also includes two appendixes that contain definitions of terms as used in the report and a summary of how various worker classifications are considered for ale determinations and under the esrp ( appendix a and appendix b ) .
this report begins with an overview of how employers determine whether they are considered an ale before outlining the esrp .
if an employer qualifies as an ale in a given year , then it will be subject to the esrp in the subsequent year .
all common - law employers , including government entities ( such as federal , state , local , or indian tribal government entities ) and nonprofit organizations that are exempt from federal income taxes , can be subject to the esrp .
with respect to the irs notification , ales began receiving a notification about potential penalties for tax year 2015 in november 2017 .
esrp penalties apply to all applicable common - law employers , including government entities ( such as federal , state , local , or indian tribal government entities ) and nonprofit organizations , even if the employers are exempt from federal income taxes .
the irs enforced a limited rollout of the provisions in 2015 , generally applying the esrp to employers with at least 100 full - time employees ( including full - time equivalent employees ) .
in 2016 , the irs further expanded enforcement to include nearly every business as required by law , except for certain specific circumstances .
