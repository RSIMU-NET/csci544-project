congress has legislative , oversight , and appropriations responsibilities related to ipr and trade policy .
individual nation states have developed ipr regimes reflecting their domestic needs and priorities .
the context for congressional interest may include policy concerns such as: the role of ipr in the u.s. economy ; the impact of ipr infringement on u.s. commercial , health , safety , and security interests ; and the balance between protecting ipr to stimulate innovation and advancing other public policy goals .
over time , ipr protection and enforcement have come to the forefront as a key international trade issue for the united states — largely due to the role of intellectual property in an innovative u.s. economy and competitive advantage — and figure prominently in the multilateral trade policy arena and in regional and bilateral u.s. free trade agreements ( ftas ) .
since 1988 , congress has included ipr as a principal u.s. trade negotiating objective , and has passed laws , such as "special 301" to advance protection and enforcement of u.s. ipr in global markets .
this report discusses the different types of ipr and ipr infringement ; the role of ipr in the u.s. economy ; estimated losses associated with ipr infringement ; the organizational structure of ipr protection and u.s. trade policy ; and issues for congress regarding ipr and international trade .
intellectual property rights ( ipr ) traditionally have been matters of national concern .
this role of congress stems from the u.s. constitution , which provides congress with the power to "promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries" and to "regulate commerce with foreign nations. .
congress has legislative , oversight , and appropriations responsibilities related to ipr and trade policy .
what follows are certain key issues that congress could consider as it fulfills those responsibilities .
since the mid - 1980s , the united states has integrated ipr policy in its international trade policy activities , pursuing enhanced ipr laws and enforcement through multilateral , regional and bilateral trade agreements , and national trade laws .
compared to foreign countries , ipr infringements levels in the united states are considered to be relatively low .
the united states is especially concerned with foreign ipr infringement of u.s. intellectual property .
in 2014 , phrma member companies collectively spent an estimated $51 billion for research and development ( domestic and abroad ) .
given the importance of intellectual property to the u.s. economy and the economic losses associated with counterfeiting and piracy , the united states is a leading advocate of strong global ipr rules .
additionally , civil and criminal penalties often are not sufficient deterrents for piracy and counterfeiting .
possible innovation - related indicators include activities concerning commercializing inventions and new technologies .
while the costs and time for research and development are high , ipr infringement occurs with relatively low costs and risks and a high profit margin .
in contrast , drug counterfeiters can lower production costs by using inexpensive , and perhaps dangerous or ineffective , ingredient substitutes .
increasing internet usage has contributed to the distribution of counterfeit and pirated products .
