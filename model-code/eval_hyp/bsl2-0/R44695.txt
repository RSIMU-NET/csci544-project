in fy2015 , dod obligated roughly $438 billion on federal contracts , which comprised 62% of contract obligations government - wide .
to fulfill its duties , the workforce must have an adequate number of acquisition professionals with an appropriate mix of technical skills ( such as cost estimating , program management , and systems engineering ) .
as part of this role , the workforce is responsible for ensuring that acquisition programs — including major weapons and information technology ( it ) systems — remain within their estimated cost and delivery schedules and produce the desired capabilities .
according to a 2014 compilation of expert views published by the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs ( permanent subcommittee on investigations ) , two - thirds of contributors felt that improved recruiting , training , and incentives for the acquisition workforce are necessary for comprehensive acquisition reform .
there are concerns , however , that the workforce may not be adequately sized or equipped with the skills necessary to support dod's acquisition workload .
the defense acquisition workforce plays a key role to ensure that dod's contract dollars are properly spent on goods and services .
the defense acquisition workforce consists of civilian and uniformed personnel at the department of defense ( dod ) who manage the planning , design , development , testing , contracting production , introduction , acquisition logistics support , and disposal of systems , equipment , facilities , supplies , or services that are intended for use in , or support of , military missions .
doing so may enable congress to consider ( 1 ) expanding or authorizing new flexibilities , ( 2 ) consolidating or removing flexibilities , ( 3 ) otherwise restructuring flexibilities , and / or ( 4 ) using other tools to achieve workforce reforms .
the oversight options presented in this section may help congress gauge whether the current number and type of hiring flexibilities are appropriate and are improving the civilian acquisition workforce .
what factors may impact effective use of available flexibilities to improve the civilian defense acquisition workforce ? .
congress has also authorized pay flexibilities for the defense acquisition workforce .
as congress continues to consider reforms to the defense acquisition system , the following policy questions regarding hiring flexibilities for the civilian defense acquisition workforce may be of interest: are flexibilities improving the civilian defense acquisition workforce ? .
dod officials asserted that the department is exploring ways to better use opm - issued retention incentives , such as targeting incentives to acquisition career fields experiencing high attrition .
pay flexibilities aim to increase retention by providing additional or higher compensation that is not typically available to federal employees .
while this report has focused on enhancing recruitment through hiring flexibilities for the civilian defense acquisition workforce , congress may also want to consider other workforce improvement efforts , such as retaining acquisition personnel that have been hired .
dod officials further noted that use of retention incentives is restricted to employees who are likely to leave federal service and "needs to" be expanded to those likely to leave the current organization .
does dod have the appropriate number and type of flexibilities ? .
according to dod , the data in table 2 include external civilian acquisition hires ( i.e. , applicants from outside the federal government ) , but do not include internal civilian acquisition hires ( i.e. , current or former federal employees ) .
