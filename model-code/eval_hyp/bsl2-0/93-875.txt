on several occasions , senate committees to whom censure or expulsion resolutions were referred have recommended certain discipline to the full body , but either the senate took no action , adjourned prior to consideration ( and the member was defeated in a subsequent election ) , the member resigned before senate action , or the senate simply did not act upon the particular recommendation or resolution .
as part of the authority delegated to it , the senate select committee on ethics may issue , and has in the past issued , "a private or public letter of admonition" on the committee's own accord , without further senate action .
senators are subject to internal , congressional discipline for any conduct which the institution of the senate believes warrants such discipline .
the focus of this report , however , is upon those disciplinary actions which were taken by the full senate against members .
additionally , it should be noted that the senate has delegated to the select committee on ethics the authority to investigate any "improper conduct" of a senator or employee "which may reflect upon the senate," and to recommend to the senate appropriate disciplinary action .
the underlying justification for legislative discipline has traditionally been to protect the integrity and dignity of the legislative institution and its proceedings , rather than merely to punish an individual ; and such internal legislative process is additional to any potential criminal or civil liability that a member might incur for any particular misconduct .
the express constitutional authority drafted by the framers of the constitution was influenced by british parliamentary practice , as well as our own colonial legislative experiences , and reflects the principle and understanding that although the qualifications of members of congress were intentionally kept to a minimum to allow the voters the broadest discretion in sending whomever they please to represent them in congress , the senate and the house have the right to discipline those who breach their privileges or decorum , or who damage their integrity or reputation , even to the extent of expelling from congress a duly - elected member .
in imposing legislative discipline against their members , the senate and the house operate through their rulemaking powers , and the express provision for legislative discipline is specifically set out within the clause of the constitution establishing the rulemaking authority of each house of congress , at article i , section 5 , clause 2: each house may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behaviour , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member .
each house of the united states congress is expressly authorized within the constitution to "punish" its own members for misconduct , and the senate has exercised this authority in the past by imposing formal "censures," imposing restitution costs , and by expelling senators from the senate .
under senate rules , no forfeiture of rights or privileges automatically follows a "censure" by the senate , but the individual political party caucus or conference rules in the senate may have relevance to party and committee leadership positions .
expulsion is the form of action whereby the senate ( or the house ) , after a member has taken the oath of office , removes that senator ( or representative , in the case of the house ) from membership in the respective body by a vote of at least two - thirds of the members present and voting .
