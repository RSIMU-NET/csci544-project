subsequently , the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act improvements act of 2015 was enacted , further amending the 1990 act .
the statute as amended ( inflation adjustment act ) requires ( 1 ) covered agencies to adjust civil monetary penalties for inflation through an initial catch - up adjustment and annually thereafter ; ( 2 ) agencies to include in the annual agency financial reports ( afr ) , submitted under office of management and budget ( omb ) circular a - 136 , financial reporting requirements , information about the civil monetary penalties within the agencies' jurisdiction , including catch - up inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts ; ( 3 ) omb to issue guidance to federal agencies for implementing inflation adjustments ; and ( 4 ) gao to annually submit to congress a report assessing federal agencies' compliance with the required adjustments for inflation .
in 1996 , congress amended the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of 1990 ( the 1990 act ) to require agencies to adjust covered civil monetary penalties established in statute for inflation .
in 2003 , we assessed federal agencies' implementation of the 1990 act , as amended by the debt collection improvement act ( dcia ) , and found that several provisions in the act prevented some agencies from fully adjusting their penalties for inflation , including a cap on initial adjustments and exemptions of certain penalties from adjustments .
congress generally establishes specific monetary amounts or maximums for civil monetary penalties in statutes , and those maximum penalties are generally reserved for the worst violations of a particular statutory requirement .
in 2016 , federal agencies assessed and collected millions of dollars in civil monetary penalties for violations of statutory requirements , such as opening deposit accounts and issuing and activating debit cards without consumers' authorization .
specifically , our objectives were to determine to what extent federal agencies , subject to the inflation adjustment act , complied with the requirements to ( 1 ) publish in the federal register their initial catch - up inflation adjustments and ( 2 ) report in the 2016 afrs information about the civil monetary penalties within the agencies' jurisdiction , including the catch - up inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts , consistent with omb guidance .
however , civil monetary penalties can lose their effectiveness to punish and deter if they are not timely adjusted for inflation .
civil monetary penalties prescribed by statute , which includes maximum penalties and specific monetary amounts that are timely adjusted for inflation , allow agencies to punish willful and egregious violators appropriately .
civil monetary penalties are a key method of regulatory enforcement , providing federal agencies authority to punish violators and serving as a deterrent to future violations .
to address our objectives , we reviewed federal agencies' documents published in the federal register and the afrs to determine whether the agencies adjusted and reported their civil monetary penalty information in compliance with the inflation adjustment act and consistent with omb guidance .
we met with omb staff and made inquiries of selected agencies' staff regarding the agencies' compliance with the inflation adjustment act .
we reviewed omb's summary list of the 52 federal agencies that could be subject to the applicable provisions of the inflation adjustment act , agencies' publications in the federal register from 2012 through 2016 , and the agencies' 2016 afrs to determine whether the agencies reported their civil monetary penalty information in compliance with the inflation adjustment act and consistent with omb guidance .
