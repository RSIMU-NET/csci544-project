such agreements may offer potential opportunities for financial benefits , including reduced maintenance costs to dod .
dod installations can establish outgrants — agreements with tenants , such as other dod organizations , non - dod federal agencies , and other government and private entities — to allow use of property on dod installations that are unutilized or underutilized .
the need to better utilize existing real property has been the focus of government - wide efforts since at least 2004 .
since 1997 , we have designated the department of defense's ( dod ) support infrastructure management as a high - risk area , in part due to the challenges dod faces in reducing excess and obsolete infrastructure .
however , this portfolio includes property that is currently unutilized ( vacant ) and underutilized ( partially vacant ) , but may be needed in the future .
this report identifies ( 1 ) what options , if any , are available for dod to allow non - dod entities , including federal government agencies , to use unutilized and underutilized space on military installations , and what factors dod considers when considering exercising each option ; ( 2 ) any limitations and benefits of bringing non - dod federal agencies onto installations , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dod and other federal agencies coordinate to do so .
the operation and maintenance of unutilized and underutilized facilities consumes valuable resources that could be eliminated from dod's budget or used by dod for other purposes .
in addition , we have designated federal real property management as a high - risk area since 2003 in part because the federal government continues to maintain too much excess and underutilized property and relies too heavily on costly leases .
in march 2015 , the acting assistant secretary of defense for energy , installations , and environment testified that a 2004 study concluded that dod had 24 percent aggregate excess infrastructure capacity and that dod's 2005 base realignment and closure process disposed of 3.4 percent of those facilities .
dod reports that , as of the end of fiscal year 2013 , the global real property portfolio it manages consisted of more than 562,000 facilities ( buildings , structures , and linear structures ) , located on over 4,800 sites worldwide , covering more than 24.7 million acres , and with a value of approximately $850 billion .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included a provision that gao report on the potential for relocating federal government tenants onto military installations in the united states .
most recently , on march 25 , 2015 , the office of management and budget issued a memorandum to clarify the existing policy to dispose of excess properties and promote more efficient use of real property assets .
property holdings are vast and diverse — comprising hundreds of thousands of buildings and permanent structures across the country , and costing billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain .
without such information sharing , dod may be missing opportunities for installations to maximize the use of space and reduce costs , and gsa risks missing opportunities for some of its clients to reduce or avoid rental costs altogether and to reduce their reliance on commercial leases .
