rs21761 - - medicare advantage: what does it mean for private plans currently serving medicarebeneficiaries ? .
cms indicates that plans are using the increases to 2004 payments to: ( 1 ) strengthen provider networks with 43% of the funds ; ( 2 ) reducepremiums with 31% of the funds ; ( 3 ) enhance benefits , including prescription drug cards , with 17% of the funds ; and ( 4 ) reduce cost sharing with 5% of the funds .
the prescription drug coverage will be provided through either newlycreated prescription drug plans or for those beneficiaries inma , medicare advantage prescription drug ( ma - pd ) plans .
for six consecutive years private plans have withdrawnfrom medicare or reduced their service areas citing lowpayment rates as the primary cause .
mma added a voluntary prescription drug benefit to medicare .
for 2004 , mma changed the payment rate calculation for medicare managed care plans , resulting in increased payment rates for all counties .
 ( 1 ) these plans are providingprescriptiondrug coverage to enrollees because their cost of providing all benefits covered by medicare under hospital insurance ( part a ) and supplementary medical insurance ( part b ) isless than the current payment rate .
starting in 2006 , beneficiaries will have access to a drug plan whether they are in traditional fee - for - service ( ffs ) medicare , or enrolled in managed care .
 ( 4 ) mma made three major changes to thepayment formula for 2004 , all designed to increase payment rates .
it may also encourage plans to expand their service areas .
historically medicare managed care plans were able to attract enrollees by offering additional benefits , one of the most popular being prescription drugs .
in 2004 , 36% of medicare advantage enrollees are enrolled in a plan that includes prescription drugs with no additional premium .
to compete with traditional medicare,some plans may redesign their benefit packages to remain attractive to their enrollees .
beneficiaries whoenrolled in these plans were willing to accept some of the restrictions of managed care , such as limitations onprovider choice , in order to have the additional benefits .
the higher payment rates may encourage organizations to stay inmedicare , and may attract other organizations , increasingcompetitive pressures on existing plans .
some plans have enhanced their drug benefits for 2004 , asdiscussed below .
approximately21% of counties not currently served by a managed care planqualify for an average payment increase of 15% or greater .
