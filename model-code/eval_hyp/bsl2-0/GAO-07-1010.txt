finally , as we have previously reported , doe has a long history of quality assurance problems and has experienced repeated difficulties in resolving these problems .
however , construction has not yet begun .
consequently , it may be years before ocrwm fully realizes the benefits of these efforts .
second , improving the quality assurance program will also require changes in the organizational behaviors of ocrwm's staff and contractors .
since doe was unable to begin the acceptance of waste in 1998 as required by the statute and contracts , the government has incurred a liability that doe now estimates to be approximately $7 billion .
first , some of doe's efforts , such as its efforts to reduce staff turnover , are in preliminary or planning stages and have not been fully implemented .
as part of the licensing process , doe must demonstrate that its repository will meet nrc's regulations , which implement the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) standard for protecting public health and the environment from harmful exposure to the radioactive waste .
each year of delay in the operation of the repository beyond 2017 could increase the government's liability by up to $500 million .
the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 established the office of civilian radioactive waste management ( ocrwm ) within the department of energy ( doe ) and directed ocrwm to construct an underground geological repository to permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste .
therefore , their effectiveness cannot yet be determined .
the act directs nrc to issue or deny construction authorization within 3 years after receiving doe's license application , unless nrc extends this period by not more than 1 year and reports the reasons for doing so to the secretary of energy and the congress .
doe project teams are responsible for carrying out various functions or aspects of the work and creating their own policies and procedures to implement the quality assurance requirements .
before construction of the repository can begin , doe must submit a license application to obtain a construction authorization from the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) .
these actions appear to be invigorating , for example , the quality assurance program by focusing management attention on improving quality by resolving problems .
ocrwm's director told us that these types of cultural changes can be particularly difficult and take a long time to implement .
we concluded that the project's management tools were ineffective for monitoring performance and detecting new quality assurance problems .
nuclear power reactors generate nearly 20 percent of the nation's electricity , but they create waste that can remain highly radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years and requires proper disposal to protect public health and the environment .
doe currently estimates that 2017 is the earliest date that the repository could open .
more than 50,000 metric tons of this radioactive waste is stored temporarily at 72 sites around the country â€” primarily at commercial nuclear power plants .
the act also set 1998 as the target date for doe to start accepting this waste and required the owners of spent nuclear fuel and high - level radioactive wastes to enter into contracts with doe for the disposal of these materials and to pay for the repository's construction and operations .
