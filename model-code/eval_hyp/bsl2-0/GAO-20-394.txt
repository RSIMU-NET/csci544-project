if such transfers include information about sensitive civilian or defense - related technologies , they could have significant consequences for u.s. national security .
similarly , unlawful transfers of such information can have adverse consequences for u.s. economic interests .
u.s. officials have expressed concern about foreign persons' access to and illicit appropriation of sensitive information and technology at u.s. universities .
other federal agencies , including the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) and dhs , educate exporters about and enforce export control regulations .
in addition , federal agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , provide funding for research and development projects that may involve items that are subject to export control regulations .
the departments of state ( state ) and commerce ( commerce ) take the lead in administering a complex set of export control regulations to advance u.s. national security and foreign policy objectives .
foreign students and scholars have made substantial contributions to such research efforts and are involved in developing many of the nation's leading - edge civilian and defense - related technologies .
he noted that china , iran , and russia are actively working to illicitly acquire and transfer technologies whose export from the united states is subject to government controls .
in a 2019 hearing before congress , for example , an acting assistant director for homeland security investigations at the department of homeland security ( dhs ) testified that exploitation of academia is one way in which adversaries are obtaining access to sensitive u.s. research .
this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which state and commerce have provided guidance and outreach that supports u.s. universities' understanding of and compliance with both agencies' export control regulations , ( 2 ) export control - related challenges that u.s. universities face working with or obtaining guidance from other federal agencies , and ( 3 ) the extent to which export compliance policies and practices developed by u.s. universities align with state's and commerce's export compliance guidelines .
similarly , in its 2019 worldwide threat assessment , the office of the director of national intelligence warned that numerous foreign intelligence services continue to target national security information and proprietary technology from u.s. research institutions .
research conducted at u.s. universities contributes significantly to u.s. national security and economic interests .
however , there is a risk that some foreign students and scholars will transfer or “export” sensitive information they gain through their research in the united states back to their home countries , which may be hostile to u.s. interests .
state controls the export of defense articles and defense services , and commerce controls the export of “dual - use” items and less sensitive military items by issuing export licenses when such exports meet the requirements outlined in the international traffic in arms regulations ( itar ) and export administration regulations ( ear ) , respectively .
you asked us to review the mechanisms u.s. agencies have developed to ensure that u.s. universities understand and comply with export control regulations as well as the security practices of u.s. universities engaged in sensitive research .
without additional action , dod may continue contributing to confusion and contract delays that hinder legitimate research .
