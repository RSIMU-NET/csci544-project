we also interviewed officials from the maritime administration ( marad ) , customs and border protection ( cbp ) , and the u.s. coast guard responsible for implementing and interpreting these laws and regulations .
as you requested , this report discusses ( 1 ) the original intent of the pvsa and how rulings and decisions regarding the act relate to its original purposes ; ( 2 ) how the exemption provided to ncl may affect the future implementation of the pvsa , u.s. vessel documentation laws , or the jones act ; ( 3 ) the potential effects of the exemption on competition in the passenger cruise industry and entry into the u.s. domestic cruise market under the u.s. flag , and the exemption's broader economic effects ; and ( 4 ) the potential economic effects of granting other cruise lines similar exemptions .
to address the original intent of the pvsa , rulings and decisions regarding the act , and how the exemption might affect the future implementation of the pvsa or other cabotage laws , we reviewed and analyzed the pvsa , its amendments and legislative history , u.s. vessel documentation laws , the exemption given to ncl , and other related laws , regulations , administrative rulings , and judicial decisions .
this exemption may also affect any future attempts to grow the u.s. - flag cruise vessel fleet .
to address the potential economic effects of the exemption on competition and entry , and the potential effects of additional exemptions , we reviewed existing studies examining competition and the economic impacts of the cruise industry ; and we also interviewed officials from cruise lines , cruise industry associations , union organizations , and ports ; representatives from the shipbuilding industry ; and other stakeholders .
cruise line officials and others have raised concerns over the exemption .
wholly domestic itineraries are reserved for u.s. vessels by the passenger vessel services act ( pvsa ) and u.s. vessel documentation laws .
the exemption potentially confers a market advantage to ncl , since other foreign - flag competitors are unable to offer the same itineraries as ncl .
in addition , we analyzed available data on capital and operating cost differentials between u.s. - flag and foreign - flag cruise vessels to determine the extent to which foreign - flag vessels have a cost advantage .
ncl has created a u.s. subsidiary , ncl america , to meet the u.s. ownership requirements to operate u.s. - flag vessels in domestic trade .
these ships must meet all other requirements to operate under the u.s. flag , including u.s. ownership requirements and operating with a u.s. crew .
these ships are therefore unaffected by the restrictions of the pvsa .
these laws require that u.s. - flag vessels providing transportation between two u.s. points must be u.s. - built , owned by u.s. citizens , and operated with u.s. crews .
however , the exemption limits the markets these ships may serve .
since most of these data are proprietary , we were unable to independently verify them because we have no authority to require access to the underlying data .
ncl is scheduled to begin service in hawaii in july 2004 .
because the u.s. - built requirement is waived and the vessels will be operating under the u.s. flag , these ships will be considered qualified to operate in the domestic trade .
