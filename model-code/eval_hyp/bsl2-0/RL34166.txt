110-81 , on september 14 , 2007 .
congress has adopted several significant changes in the federal law concerning the disclosure of lobbying activities by professional lobbyists , and in internal congressional rules with respect to the acceptance of gifts and travel by members of congress and staff from certain outside private interests , such as lobbyists and their clients .
over the last few years several instances of individual members of congress and of certain high - ranking officials in the president's administration incurring ethics problems and / or being involved in federal or state corruption investigations and prosecutions have been widely reported in the press and have garnered significant national publicity .
the intent of the statutory amendments and the internal congressional rules changes was to address the concerns over allegations and appearances of improper or undue influence of special private interests , and their hired lobbyists , over high - ranking government officials and decision makers .
the statute and rule changes which have been adopted address five general areas of reform: ( 1 ) broader and more detailed disclosures of lobbying activities by paid lobbyists , and more disclosures concerning the intersection of the activities of professional lobbyists and government policy makers ; ( 2 ) more extensive restrictions on the offering and receipt of gifts for members of congress and their staff , including gifts of transportation and travel expenses ; ( 3 ) new restrictions addressing the so - called "revolving door," that is , post - government - employment "lobbying" activities by former high level government officials on behalf of private interests ; ( 4 ) reform of the pension provisions with regard to members of congress found guilty of abusing the public trust ; and ( 5 ) greater transparency in the internal legislative process in the house and senate , including "earmark" disclosures and accountability .
the unfolding of an extensive "lobbying and gifts" scandal concerning convicted lobbyists and their provision of privately funded travel , free meals , and entertainment to members , congressional staff , and certain executive branch officials , has been a continuing major news story focusing public and congressional attention on questions of lobbying reform , gift rules , and transparency in congressional and other governmental operations .
additionally , in the u.s. system of government and elections , campaigns for public office are privately financed , and any reforms enacted had to recognize the necessity and reality of having to raise large sums of campaign funds from private citizens by any member of congress or other candidate seeking to run a viable campaign for federal office .
the subject of "ethics" and "corruption" in government may arguably have been the single most significant issue for voters in the 2006 congressional elections , with national exit polls showing that the issue of "corruption" was "extremely important" to 42% of the voters , greater even than "terrorism" ( 40% ) , the "economy" ( 39% ) , or "iraq" ( 37% ) .
