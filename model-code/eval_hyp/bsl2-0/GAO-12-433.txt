this report discusses ( 1 ) key actions usps has taken to restructure its retail network over the past 5 years ; ( 2 ) concerns raised by postal stakeholders , including congress , the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) , usps office of inspector general ( oig ) , and postal business and residential customers , and usps's response to these concerns ; and ( 3 ) the challenges that usps faces in changing its retail network .
some members of congress have raised concerns about these plans and the potential negative impact that closing post offices could have on affected communities .
congress has been considering several postal reform bills to put usps on a path to financial viability , and some members have asked usps to postpone retail facility closures so as not to pre - empt congressional action on postal reform .
usps projects a $14.1 billion net loss for fiscal year 2012 and faces a continuing decline in the demand for its products and services .
to address its financial crisis , the postmaster general told congress last september that usps plans to reduce annual costs organization - wide by $20 billion — or 27 percent of its projected $73 billion total operating expenses — by fiscal year 2015 .
but it appears that usps cannot restructure its retail network unless congress addresses usps's financial instability and the long - standing challenges that hinder its ability to change its retail network .
to help inform your consideration of actions needed to restructure usps operations and help it achieve financial viability , you asked us to examine its retail network .
postal service ( usps ) as a financially self - sufficient entity that was expected to cover its expenses almost entirely through postal revenues , yet at the end of fiscal year 2011 , it had incurred a $5.1 billion loss for the year , had $2 billion remaining on its $15 billion borrowing limit , and had not yet made its $5.5 billion scheduled retiree health benefits payment to the federal government .
if congress prefers to retain the current level of service and associated network , decisions will need to be made about how usps's costs for providing these services will be paid , including additional cost reductions or revenue sources .
in addition , usps is exploring expansion of alterative access through such things as franchising opportunities and use of kiosks to create additional channels to access retail services .
also during this period , mail volume has declined by about 21 percent , and usps's financial condition continued to deteriorate as net losses accumulated to more than $25 billion .
approximately 80 percent of its retail facilities do not generate sufficient revenue to cover their costs .
also , certain policy issues are unresolved , and pending legislation takes differing approaches to resolving usps's challenges .
moreover , the number of usps - operated retail facilities,about 32,000 , has remained largely unchanged over the past 5 years even as visits to , and transactions at , postal retail facilities have decreased by about 16 percent and 18 percent , respectively .
usps's ability to continue providing its current level of services is in jeopardy , and it is up to both congress and usps to construct solutions that will either reduce the cost of services or increase revenues from other sources .
