dod has taken no direct actions in response to these recommendations and has stated that its current acquisition approach fulfills the intent of dod policy and further limits on production are unnecessary .
in 2006 congress reduced the number of production aircraft to be funded in fiscal year 2007 and the number of aircraft to receive advanced procurement funds for aircraft to be procured in fiscal year 2008 .
this report assesses the progress of the jsf program since it was rebaselined in fiscal year 2004 to add resources needed to address technical problems .
the ronald w. reagan national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 ( p.l .
specifically , we ( 1 ) determined the jsf program's progress in meeting cost , schedule , and performance goals ; and ( 2 ) identified the challenges and risk the program will face in meeting these goals in the future .
we recommended dod pursue an acquisition strategy consistent with best practices and dod policy preferences regarding evolutionary and knowledge - based acquisitions including deferring production investments until the aircraft have been proven to work in flight testing .
dod currently estimates it will spend $276 billion to develop and procure about 2,443 aircraft and related support equipment by 2027 and an additional $347 billion to operate and support these aircraft once they have been fielded .
108-375 ) requires gao to review the jsf program annually for 5 years .
in the past 2 years , we issued reports identifying opportunities for the program to reduce risks and improve the chance for more successful outcomes .
the joint strike fighter ( jsf ) is the department of defense's ( dod ) most expensive aircraft acquisition program .
jsf is a central part of dod's overall recapitalization strategy for its tactical aircraft fleet , representing 90 percent of the remaining planned investment for its major tactical aircraft programs .
we were provided sufficient information to measure the program's progress in meeting its goals based on cost data provided in april 2006 as well as the challenges that remain for the program .
we performed our work from june of 2006 to march of 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
the act also requires us to certify whether we had access to sufficient information to make informed judgments on the matters contained in our report .
at the time of our review , dod was still preparing its new cost estimate to be included in the program's selected acquisition report dated december 31 , 2006 , expected to be delivered to the congress by april 2007 .
the jsf aircraft design includes three variants to be used by the air force , navy , marine corps , and eight cooperative international partners .
it should be noted that after our 2006 report was issued on march 15 , 2006 , dod released its december 2005 selected acquisition report , which showed an increase of over $19 billion in estimated jsf program costs .
because the new cost estimate for the jsf program will not be available until after this report is issued we are unable to make informed judgments on those estimated costs .
