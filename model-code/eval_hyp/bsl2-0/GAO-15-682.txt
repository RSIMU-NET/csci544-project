this report examines the extent to which ( 1 ) npfc has designed and implemented internal controls over damage claim and oil removal disbursements to reasonably assure that amounts are appropriately disbursed from the fund ; ( 2 ) npfc has designed and implemented internal controls to reasonably assure that responsible parties are designated and billed , as appropriate , for disbursements from the fund that are over $500,000 ; and ( 3 ) the fund was reimbursed for damage claim and oil removal costs in fiscal years 2011 through 2013 .
the federal government's potential fiscal exposure increases as responsible parties' capacity to cover their exposures is reduced , whether as a result of extensive oil spill liabilities , poor financial condition of responsible parties , or other factors .
opa and other federal laws set out the federal process for oil spill response management , the liability of different parties in the event of an oil spill incident , and federal funding to cover certain oil spill costs not covered by private parties .
the fund is administered by the u.s. coast guard's national pollution funds center ( npfc ) .
the oil pollution act of 1990 ( opa ) , which congress enacted after the exxon valdez spill in 1989 , authorized use of the oil spill liability trust fund ( fund ) to pay for certain oil spill cleanup costs and damages for immediate response costs and when the responsible parties cannot be identified or do not pay .
the coast guard authorization act of 2010 included a provision for gao to conduct an audit of fund disbursements .
to assess the design of existing internal controls over the damage claim and oil removal processes for reasonably assuring amounts are appropriately disbursed from the fund , we ( 1 ) reviewed opa and other federal laws and regulations to obtain an understanding of allowed costs , ( 2 ) reviewed standards for internal control in the federal government and evaluated the policies and procedures npfc has in place for damage claim and oil removal disbursements , ( 3 ) evaluated potential risks and the effectiveness of npfc's controls to mitigate those risks , ( 4 ) interviewed npfc officials and staff , and ( 5 ) performed walk - throughs of the damage claim and oil removal processes .
opa also provided that the federal government may subsequently seek reimbursement for these costs from responsible parties .
to assess the design of internal controls for reasonably assuring that responsible parties were designated and billed , as appropriate , for disbursements from the fund that are over $500,000 , we ( 1 ) reviewed npfc's policies and procedures for designating and billing the responsible parties , ( 2 ) evaluated potential risks and the effectiveness of npfc's controls to mitigate those risks , ( 3 ) interviewed npfc officials and staff , and ( 4 ) obtained billings and receipt data for fiscal years 2011 through 2014 .
the 27 damage claim disbursements accounted for 93 percent of the total amount of damage claim disbursements and the 61 oil removal disbursements accounted for 30 percent of the total amount of oil removal disbursements for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 .
we also report on the fund's reliance on the per - barrel oil tax , which is its primary source of revenue .
