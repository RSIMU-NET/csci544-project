to date ( july 2017 ) , the paris club has reached 433 agreements with 90 debtor countries .
the total amount of debt covered in paris club agreements — rescheduled or reduced — is approximately $583 billion .
official sector debts are those that have been issued , insured , or guaranteed by creditor governments .
the paris club includes the united states and 21 other permanent members , the major international creditor governments .
besides the united states , the permanent membership is composed of australia , austria , belgium , brazil , canada , denmark , finland , france , germany , ireland , israel , italy , japan , netherlands , norway , russia , south korea , spain , sweden , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
a paris club 'treatment' refers to either a reduction and / or renegotiation of a developing country's paris club debts .
it is rather a set of rules and principles for debt relief that have been agreed on by its members .
in addition to representatives from the creditor and debtor nations , officials from the international financial institutions ( ifis ) and the regional development banks are represented at paris club discussions .
other creditors are allowed to participate in negotiations on an ad - hoc basis .
the paris club is the major forum where creditor countries renegotiate official sector debts .
 ( the united states and several other countries routinely provide 100% bilateral debt cancellation. ) .
the ifis present their assessment of the debtor country's economic situation to the paris club .
non - hipc countries seeking debt relief first undergo an imf debt sustainability analysis .
the entry of brazil into the paris club is notable since they are the first developing country to join in two decades .
if the country is also determined to suffer from debt sustainability problems , where it lacks the long - term resources to meet its debt obligations and the amount of debt adversely affects its future ability to pay , the country is eligible for debt cancellation .
instead of using economic indicators to determine eligibility for debt relief , all potential debt relief cases are now divided into two groups: hipc and non - hipc countries .
hipc countries will continue to receive assistance under cologne terms , which sanction up to 90% debt cancellation .
these can include u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) loans , military aid loans , export - import bank loans and guarantees , and agricultural credits guaranteed by the commodity credit corporation .
the act , among other things , provides for new budgetary treatment of and establishes new budgetary requirements for direct loan obligations .
the current paris club chairman is jean - pierre jouyet , under - secretary of the french treasury .
prior to the passage of the act , neither budget authority nor appropriations were required for official debt relief and bilateral debt ( and other federal commitments ) were accounted for on a cash - flow basis , which credits income as it is received and expenses as they are paid .
since passage of the act , u.s. government agencies are required to value u.s. loans , such as bilateral debt owed to the united states , on a net present value basis rather than at their face value , and an appropriation by congress of the estimated amount of debt relief is required in advance of any debt relief taking place .
