as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we will describe ( 1 ) the health care benefit targeted to women covered under the tricare program and how this benefit compares to national clinical guidelines and other health plans' offerings and ( 2 ) women beneficiaries' satisfaction with and concerns about dod's health care benefit .
the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2002 directed that we study the adequacy and quality of the health care provided to women by dod .
with a health care system historically oriented towards men , dod has been challenged to ensure that its women beneficiaries receive the full range of services including primary , specialty , preventive , and reproductive care .
to conduct our work , we reviewed relevant policies and procedures and interviewed officials from dod's health affairs' office of clinical and program policy ; dod's tricare management activity ( tma ) ; and the surgeons general offices for the air force , army , and navy .
we also interviewed officials from the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog ) and reviewed two of the largest health care plans under the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) to compare the covered benefits with tricare's .
about half of all beneficiaries who are eligible to use tricare , the department of defense's ( dod ) health care program , are women â€” either active duty personnel , family members , or retirees .
to determine beneficiaries' perceptions on women's health care services in tricare , we relied on our past work on dod health care , and we reviewed the latest available data from two dod surveys: a dod - wide health care survey on beneficiary satisfaction and a survey targeted at inpatient care during childbirth at selected military treatment facilities ( mtf ) .
in addition , we held interviews with the defense advisory committee on women in the services ( dacowits ) , a group that advises the secretary of defense on issues concerning active duty women , and the national military family association ( nmfa ) , an advocacy group that obtains beneficiary views on issues concerning military families .
 ( for more on our scope and methodology , see app .
our work was conducted from november 2001 through april 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
it should also be noted that while our review focuses on health care for women beneficiaries , a number of our findings pertain to men as well , which we note where appropriate .
however , we did not independently validate this information or determine the prevalence of beneficiary concerns .
i. ) .
overall , dod data indicate that women beneficiaries are satisfied with the tricare health care benefit , but some have concerns about the care available to them .
in some cases , beneficiaries and commanders have not been adequately trained about the importance of women's basic health care and its effect on readiness .
dod has also implemented specific initiatives that affect health care provided to women beneficiaries , including maternity care and breast cancer care .
dod offers a full range of health care services for women beneficiaries through the tricare benefit .
