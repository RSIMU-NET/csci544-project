with the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l .
the revision of the nrp was also due to mandates in the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( p.l .
these efforts culminated in the initial national response plan ( nrp ) on october 10 , 2003 , followed by the release of nims on march 1 , 2004 .

109-295 , hereafter the post - katrina act ) .
in august 2005 , hurricane katrina made landfall , followed shortly by hurricanes rita and wilma .
events such as the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and hurricane katrina of august 2005 , prompted congress and president bush to require the development of a plan for how government at all levels , and also the nongovernmental sector , should respond to all types of emergencies and disasters .
it discusses some of the reasons the bush administration revised the nrp , as well as some controversial aspects of the review process .
in january 2008 , dhs issued the nrf , which took effect in march 2008 .
prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the structure for responding to emergencies and disasters resided in at least 5 separate plans .
since that time , the nrf has been the nation's core response document , providing a structure for the response to such disasters as the 2008 midwest floods and california wildfires , as well as hurricanes gustav and ike .
congress and president bush devoted considerable attention to how the nation can best prevent , prepare for , respond to , and recover from natural and human - caused disasters .
dhs made the decision to revise the nrp partially based on these reports .
a number of studies on the responses to these hurricanes found shortcomings in the nrp itself and its implementation .
the report also summarizes selected pending legislation concerning national response planning and concludes with a discussion of issues over which congress might consider exercising oversight .
this report reviews selected statutory provisions related to the nrf and provides an overview of the document .
the nrf is the end product of a long history .
in response to directives from congress and the president , the bush administration issued the nrf to establish a new approach to coordinate federal and nonfederal entities in times of emergencies and major disasters .
additionally , anecdotal reports following gustav and ike indicate the coordination of emergency activities among federal , state , and local governments has improved .
the document is more concise , has less jargon , and has made an attempt to clarify roles and responsibilities .
