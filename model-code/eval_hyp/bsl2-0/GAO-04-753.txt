dod has undertaken several human capital reforms that will affect its future civilian workforce of approximately 700,000 personnel .
in addition , technological advances have generated the need for a dod civilian workforce with more advanced education and greater technological skills .
the strategic workforce planning process includes five elements used by leading public - and private - sector organizations: ( 1 ) involvement of management , employees , and stakeholders in developing , communicating , and implementing strategic workforce plans ; ( 2 ) performing analyses to identify critical skill and competency gaps between current and future workforce needs ; ( 3 ) developing strategies to fill these skill and competency gaps ; ( 4 ) building the capability necessary to address administrative , educational , or other requirements to support workforce strategies ; and ( 5 ) monitoring and evaluating progress and the contribution of strategic workforce planning efforts in achieving program goals .
strategic workforce planning is an iterative , systematic process that addresses two critical needs: ( 1 ) aligning an organization's human capital program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals and ( 2 ) developing long - term strategies for acquiring , developing , and retaining an organization's workforce to achieve programmatic goals .
for these and other human capital reforms to have maximum effectiveness and value , it is critical that dod engage in effective strategic workforce planning .
the problem is exacerbated by today's emerging security threats and rapidly evolving technology .
futhermore , dod was granted permanent authority beginning in fiscal year 2004 to extend buyouts to as many as 25,000 civilian employees each year to downsize or restructure the workforce to meet mission objectives .
in addition , dod has undertaken efforts to convert over 20,000 military positions to civilian positions in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 , and more conversions are to be addressed in fiscal year 2006 and the out - years .
one major initiative is dod's creation of a new human capital management system , the national security personnel system ( nsps ) , which will give the department significant flexibility for creating a new framework of rules , regulations , and processes to govern the way civilians are hired , compensated , promoted , and disciplined .
leading public - sector organizations have found that strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious change management initiative to transform the culture of government agencies .
civilian personnel have been deployed along with military personnel to participate in operations such as iraqi freedom , desert storm , bosnia , and kosovo .
critical skills are core mission and support occupations that are vital to the accomplishment of an agency's goals and objectives .
as agreed with your office , we determined ( 1 ) the extent to which civilian strategic workforce plans have been developed and implemented to address future civilian workforce requirements and ( 2 ) the major challenges affecting the development and implementation of civilian strategic workforce plans .
strategic workforce planning , an integral part of human capital management , helps ensure that an organization has the staff with the necessary skills and competencies to accomplish its strategic goals .
with more than 50 percent of its civilian personnel becoming eligible to retire in the next 5 years , dod may find it difficult to fill certain mission - critical jobs with qualified personnel .
