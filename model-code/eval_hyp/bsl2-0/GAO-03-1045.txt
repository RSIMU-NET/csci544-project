in response , we assessed ( 1 ) how accuracy may have changed since vba increased its emphasis on production and ( 2 ) how well vba ensures the accuracy of its decisions .
for fiscal year 2003 , vba's goals are to produce about 806,000 decisions and further reduce inventory to 250,000 claims .
in light of vba's emphasis on completing more claims decisions more quickly , you asked us to assist the committee in its oversight of vba by examining the agency's efforts to ensure the accuracy of decision - making in its disability compensation and pension benefits programs .
during fiscal year 2002 , vba increased its claims decisions by two - thirds from about 481,000 to about 797,000 and reduced its inventory of pending claims by about one - fifth from about 421,000 to about 346,000 .
in order to improve the timeliness of its disability claims decisions , vba established a goal of completing about 839,000 decisions in fiscal year 2002 and reducing its inventory of pending claims to about 316,000 by the end of that year .
we reviewed vba's efforts to measure and report accuracy for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 .
at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 , over 400,000 claims for disability compensation and pension benefits were waiting for veterans benefits administration ( vba ) decisions .
vba has been making a concerted effort to reduce the inventory of claims and complete decisions in an average of 100 days by the end of fiscal year 2003 .
to determine how accuracy had changed over that time , we independently calculated and compared vba's accuracy rates for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 .
on average , veterans were waiting about 6 months and many were waiting more than a year .
as part of our analysis of how well vba ensures national and regional office accuracy , we reviewed vba's accuracy measurement system , known as the systematic technical accuracy review ( star ) program , including how vba incorporates accuracy into its performance standards for both regional office directors and claims processing staff .
vba has made significant progress in getting its compensation and pension claims workload under control to improve timeliness for veterans waiting for decisions on their claims .
however , vba's accuracy has declined .
unless vba balances its emphasis on producing more and faster decisions with an increased emphasis on accuracy , it will be difficult to ensure that veterans are getting the benefits to which they are entitled in a timely manner .
we also discussed accuracy issues with representatives of the american legion , disabled american veterans , paralyzed veterans of america , and veterans of foreign wars to gain their perspectives on vba efforts to improve accuracy .
in addition , we examined vba's criteria for regional office performance awards and the results of reviews by vba survey teams of regional offices .
we discussed factors affecting accuracy with staff at vba regional offices in phoenix , arizona ; st. petersburg , florida ; boston , massachusetts ; pittsburgh , pennsylvania ; and houston , texas .
while vba has made progress in measuring regional office accuracy , it has not made full use of the results to reward high performing offices or to improve poorly performing offices .
