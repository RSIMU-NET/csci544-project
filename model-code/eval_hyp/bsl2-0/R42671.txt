several recent and pending epa regulations implementing the various pollution control statutes enacted by congress have garnered vigorous oversight during the 112 th congress .
members have expressed concerns , in hearings , through bipartisan letters commenting on proposed regulations , and through introduced legislation that would delay , limit , or prevent certain epa actions .
epa expects that requirements and emission reductions associated with existing and recently promulgated federal regulations under the caa will significantly allay impacts of complying with the proposed revised pm standards , and anticipates that virtually all counties will meet the standards as proposed in 2020 .
because of health and cost implications , naaqs decisions historically have been the source of significant concern to some in congress .
particular attention is being paid to the caa , under which epa has moved forward with the first federal controls on emissions of greenhouse gases and also addressed emissions of conventional pollutants from a number of industries .
this crs report summarizes epa's june 2012 proposed changes to the pm naaqs and includes comparisons with previous ( 1997 ) and current ( 2006 ) promulgated and proposed standards .
in its regulatory impact analysis ( ria ) accompanying the proposed rule assessing the costs and benefits of proposed revisions to the pm naaqs , epa estimated that strengthening the pm 2 .
on the other hand , tighter standards could impose additional compliance requirements on communities , states , industry , and others , at what some stakeholders and members contend will be a substantial economic cost .
others have suggested that potential health benefits of tightening the pm naaqs might be higher than epa's estimates .
during the 112 th congress , some members expressed concerns in hearings , letters to the administrator , and proposed legislation in anticipation of potential changes to the pm naaqs , and the june 2012 proposal is expected to generate further oversight .
5 annual standard would add further similar health benefits anticipated with the promulgation of the 2006 pm naaqs .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) administrator signed a proposal to strengthen the national ambient air quality standard ( naaqs ) for particulate matter ( pm ) on june 14 , 2012 , intended to address potential health effects ( including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality ) associated with short - and long - term exposure to particulate matter .
as per statutory scheduling requirements under the caa , the final designation of areas ( primarily counties ) as nonattainment for any revised pm standards would not be determined until the end of 2014 , and states would have until at least 2020 to achieve compliance .
the evolution and development of the pm naaqs , in particular , have been the subject of extensive oversight .
epa's most recent statutorily required review and proposal has generated controversy and national debate among stakeholders , health and environmental advocacy groups , and states , as well as oversight in congress , as did the previous changes leading up to the existing pm naaqs promulgated october 2006 , and those established in 1997 .
because some farming and livestock practices contribute to particulate matter emissions , the agricultural community and some members have maintained a particular interest in epa's consideration of pm 10 and the potential impacts on agricultural operations .
