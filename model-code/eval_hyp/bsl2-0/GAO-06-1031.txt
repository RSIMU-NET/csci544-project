specific instances have been widely reported in newspapers and other media , including cases involving members of congress and other high - profile individuals .
misidentifications can result in travel delays and other inconveniences for the respective individuals .
misidentifications highlight the importance of having a process — often referred to as redress — for affected persons to express their concerns , seek correction of any inaccurate data , and request other actions to reduce or eliminate future inconveniences .
to identify individuals with known or potential links to terrorism , since the tragedies of september 11 , 2001 , agencies such as the departments of state , justice , and homeland security have implemented enhanced procedures to screen international travelers , airline passengers , and visa applicants .
the database , which contains names of foreign and u.s. citizens , is maintained by the terrorist screening center , an entity that has been operational since december 2003 under the administration of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) .
based upon agency - specific policies and criteria , relevant portions of the terrorist screening center's consolidated watch list can be used in a wide range of security - related screening procedures .
one important homeland security tool used by these federal frontline - screening agencies is the terrorist - screening database , otherwise known as the consolidated watch list , containing the names of individuals with known and suspected links to terrorism .
similarly , such a process would apply to other persons affected by the maintenance of watch list data , including persons whose names are actually on the watch list but should not be ( “mistakenly listed persons” ) as well as persons who are properly listed .
because terrorist watch list screening involves comparisons based on personal - identifying information such as names and dates of birth , there is potential to generate misidentifications — given that two or more persons , for example , may have the same or similar names .
as such , the screening inevitably can raise concerns from individuals who assert that they are being misidentified because of a name similarity to some other person whose name is on the watch list .
what are the major reasons that misidentifications occur , and what actions are the terrorist screening center and frontline - screening agencies taking to reduce the number of misidentified persons or expedite them through the screening process ? .
regarding the screening of air passengers , in addition to contacting the transportation security administration to broadly discuss the procedures of air carriers , we interviewed security officials at five major , domestic air carriers .
we are not making recommendations at this time because the agencies have ongoing efforts to improve data quality and otherwise either reduce the number of misidentifications or mitigate their effects and to provide more effective redress .
to address concerns from misidentified and mistakenly listed persons , what opportunities for redress have the terrorist screening center and frontline - screening agencies established ? .
also , to help ensure that known or suspected terrorists do not enter the united states , applicable portions of the watch list are to be checked by department of state consular officers before issuing u.s. visas and by u.s. customs and border protection officers before admitting persons at air , land , and sea ports of entry .
