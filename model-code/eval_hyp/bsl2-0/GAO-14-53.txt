this report compares ( 1 ) the health status of medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before enrollment and ( 2 ) the spending and use of services by medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before enrollment .
this suggests that the extent to which individuals enroll in private insurance before age 65 has implications for beneficiaries' health status and medicare spending .
you asked us to provide information on the effects of medicare beneficiaries' health insurance coverage before enrollment on their health status , spending , and use of services after enrollment .
previous research has produced inconclusive results concerning the extent to which , if at all , health insurance coverage before medicare enrollment affects beneficiaries' spending and use of services after enrollment .
to examine the effects of continuous health insurance coverage before medicare ( our independent variable of interest ) on beneficiaries' health status , spending , and use of services ( our dependent variables of interest ) , we used data from the health and retirement study ( hrs ) and medicare claims .
the health insurance coverage of pre - medicare individuals may have implications for the medicare program .
previous research regarding the extent to which health insurance coverage prior to medicare enrollment affects beneficiaries' spending and use of services after enrollment has been inconclusive , possibly because of different definitions of prior insurance and different approaches for dealing with the potential for reverse causality between health status and health insurance coverage .
as a result , these individuals may be in worse health and may require more costly medical services after medicare enrollment compared with those who were insured .
from the medicare data , we obtained information from 2001 through 2010 on multiple categories of beneficiaries' medicare spending ( total , institutional outpatient , and physician and other noninstitutional spending ) and services ( institutional outpatient and physician office visits ) .
health insurance protects individuals against the risk of financial hardship when they need medical care , and uninsured pre - medicare individuals may refrain from seeking necessary care because of the cost .
using our methodology , we found significant differences in medicare spending between beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance .
additionally , we found that beneficiaries without prior continuous insurance had higher total and institutional outpatient spending but did not have higher spending for physician and other noninstitutional services , suggesting that they required more intensive medical services or that they were accustomed to visiting hospitals more than physician offices .
from hrs , we obtained information from 1996 through 2010 on beneficiaries' self - reported health insurance coverage before medicare , self - reported health status in medicare , and demographic and health - related characteristics .
unlike other studies , we performed our analysis for multiple groups of medicare beneficiaries categorized by their length of medicare enrollment .
like researchers who did not find significant differences in medicare spending between beneficiaries with and without prior insurance coverage , we excluded individuals who were enrolled in government health programs prior to age 65 from our analysis because of the possibility that they lost insurance coverage because of poor health , which could have resulted in an overestimate of the effect of having prior insurance on medicare spending after age 65 .
