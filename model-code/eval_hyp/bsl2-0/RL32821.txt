 ( 6 ) senaterepublicans , in turn , have accused senate democrats of using their own ideological "litmus tests"to oppose certain judicial nominees and of making improper use of filibusters ( extended debate asa delaying tactic ) on the senate floor to block senate votes on circuit court nominees whom theyoppose .
at times , senate democrats have accused president bush of using hisnominating power to appoint to the courts persons having controversial ideological agendas , and ofmaking judicial appointments during senate recesses in order to bypass the need for senateconfirmation .
any supreme court nomination must be confirmed by the u.s. senate , which , in recentcongresses , has been embroiled in controversies over various of the president's nominations to thelower federal courts .
 ( 7 ) against this backdrop , a supreme court vacancy can be seen by senators of both parties , atleast to some extent , in an ideological context .
under any circumstances , it will command the attention of congress,especially the senate , which votes on whether to confirm judicial nominations .
 ( 1 ) on september 3 , 2005 , chief justice william h. rehnquist died , after having served almost19 years as chief justice .
depending on their judicial philosophy , future appointees to the court , senatorsrecognize , could have a potentially decisive impact on the court's ideological balance and , as well,on whether past rulings of the court will be upheld , modified , or overturned .
 ( 2 ) he had been diagnosed with cancer in october 2004 and , although in ill health since then , hadmanaged to lead the court through its last term , which ended in late june 2005 .
 ( 5 ) out of respect for the latechief justice , whose funeral was held on september 7 , the senate judiciary committee postponedthe start of its hearings on judge roberts' nomination to be chief justice until september 12 .
many highly controversial decisions of the court inrecent years have been closely decided , by 5-4 votes , appearing to underscore a longstandingphilosophical or ideological divide in the court between its more "liberal" and "conservative"members .
 ( 4 ) at age 50 , judge roberts , if confirmed by the senate , wouldbecome the youngest chief justice at time of confirmation in more than 200 years .
that action sent the nomination to thefull senate , which is expected to vote on whether to confirm judge roberts on september 29 .
 ( 8 ) all other things being equal , the appointment of a chief justice , owing to the responsibilitiesof the office and its symbolic importance , is foremost among the appointments that a presidentmakes to the supreme court .
even more attentionis expected in the current political environment , in light of the controversy that has recentlysurrounded the judicial appointment process and the importance that the president and senators ofboth parties have attached to upcoming supreme court appointments .
chief justice appointments occur infrequently , with only 16 individuals having served in thatposition since 1789 - - an average tenure of 13â½ years per chief justice .
other factors , moreover , can further complicate the appointment of a chief justice .
