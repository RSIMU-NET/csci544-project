officials from the big 3 have requested immediate federal financial assistance , reporting that their companies are experiencing significant financial stress .
less than two days ago , the big 3 submitted business plans to congress that describe their requests for federal assistance and restructuring plans .
congress has asked us to review these plans .
deteriorating financial , real estate , and labor markets have reduced consumer confidence and available credit , and automobile purchases have declined .
in addition to potential job losses at auto manufacturers , the collapse or partial collapse of the domestic auto industry would adversely affect auto dealers , suppliers , and other sectors .
the current economic downturn has added to the significant financial stress facing that industry .
while most auto manufacturers have experienced declining sales in 2008 , recent economic conditions have particularly hurt sales of the “big 3” domestic auto manufacturers ( general motors , ford , and chrysler ) , in part because these companies have historically derived most of their sales from vehicles such as sport utility vehicles , which are less fuel efficient , but more profitable than small cars .
the tightening of the credit markets has also affected the big 3 and their suppliers , which together employ about 730,000 people .
after reaching a recent high of about 1.8 million in july 2005 , the number of vehicles sold in the united states dropped to about 800,000 in october 2008 , approximately a 54 percent decline .
higher gasoline prices over the past several years , which rose to over $4 per gallon in the summer of 2008 before falling steeply this fall , have contributed to a sharp decline in consumer demand for these vehicles .
in deciding whether to provide financial assistance , congress must consider and balance the perceived need for expedience with the need to put a structure in place to ensure that the interests of taxpayers are safeguarded and the specific problems that have put the industry in its current financial crisis are addressed .
my remarks are based on our extensive body of work on previous federal financial assistance efforts that dates back to the 1970s , including those efforts directed to individual large corporations , such as the chrysler corporation and lockheed aircraft corporation , as well as municipalities and commercial aviation .
in my statement today , i will discuss principles that could serve as a framework for considering the desirability , nature , scope , and conditions of possible federal financial assistance and , should congress decide to provide financial assistance , how these principles could be applied in these circumstances .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on possible federal assistance to the domestic auto industry .
however , providing federal financial assistance to the auto manufacturing industry raises concerns about protecting the government's interests and the precedent such assistance could set for other industries seeking relief from the current economic downturn .
these principles are drawn directly from gao's support of congressional efforts over several decades to assist segments of industries , firms , the savings and loan industry , and municipalities .
the collapse or partial collapse of the domestic auto manufacturing industry would have a significant ripple effect throughout other sectors of the economy and serve as a drag on an already weakened economy .
