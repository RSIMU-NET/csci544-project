in 2010 , ssa paid almost 8 million recipients about $50 billion in ssi benefits , of which more than $9 billion was paid to about 1.2 million disabled children .
since that time , the number of children receiving ssi benefits has continued to rise , especially for those with mental impairments .
administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) , ssi is a nationwide federal assistance program that provides cash benefits to eligible low - income disabled individuals , including children , as well as certain individuals who are aged or blind .
during the early and mid 1990s , the ssi program experienced a period of unprecedented growth for children due , in part , to legal developments that expanded program eligibility for children with mental impairments .
my statement today focuses on initial observations from our ongoing review and examines ( 1 ) the trends in the rate of children receiving ssi benefits due to mental impairments over the past decade ; ( 2 ) the role that medical and nonmedical information , such as medication and school records , play in the initial determination of a child's medical eligibility ; and ( 3 ) the steps ssa has taken to monitor the continued medical eligibility of these children .
for example , from the end of 1989 through 1996 , the number of children receiving ssi benefits more than tripled from 265,000 to about 955,000 .
our prior work has shown that accurately diagnosing some types of mental impairments is a complex and often subjective process for ssa , which can sometimes be vulnerable to fraud and abuse .
to examine these issues , we collected agency data on the overall number of initial disability determinations and allowances , the number and types of mental impairments , and the number of continuing disability reviews of children conducted by ssa .
the recently enacted budget control act of 2011 authorized an increase in funding for cdrs and redeterminations under both the ssi and the social security disability insurance programs , starting with an additional $623 million in fiscal year 2012 and reaching an additional $1.3 billion in each of fiscal years 2017 to 2021 .
from 1996 to 2002 , congress provided funding to ssa to conduct additional cdrs for both social security disability and ssi beneficiaries .
our work included site visits to 9 field offices within these regions , as well as 11 state disability determination services ( dds ) offices ( state agencies under the direction of ssa that perform medical eligibility determinations and continuing disability reviews of ssi applicants ) .
since this funding expired , the number of cdrs ssa has conducted overall has dramatically declined .
we assessed the reliability of the data presented in this statement and found potential limitations with the extent to which primary and secondary impairment codes within ssa's 831 disability files — the file that contains data on disability determinations — may be complete .
however , because the 831 disability files are used by ssa to reflect the decisions made regarding medical determinations , we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to describe certain trends among children in the ssi program .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our preliminary observations on children with mental impairments in the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
