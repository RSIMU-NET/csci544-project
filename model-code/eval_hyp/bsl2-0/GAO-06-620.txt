effective information security controls affect the integrity , confidentiality , and availability of sensitive information — such as personnel and regulatory information — maintained by fdic .
these controls are essential to ensure that financial information is adequately protected from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , fraudulent use , improper disclosure , or destruction .
the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) has a demanding responsibility enforcing banking laws , regulating banking institutions , and protecting depositors .
in enforcing banking laws , it plays an important role in maintaining public confidence in the nation's financial system .
the corporation relies extensively on computerized systems to support and carry out its financial and mission - related operations .
as part of our audit of the calendar year 2005 financial statements for fdic's bank insurance fund , the savings association insurance fund , and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation ( fslic ) resolution fund , we assessed ( 1 ) the progress fdic has made in correcting or mitigating remaining information system control weaknesses reported as unresolved at the time of our prior review in 2004 and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of the corporation's information system controls for protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of its information and information systems .
our review was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
fdic has taken steps to address security control weaknesses .
we performed our review at fdic headquarters in washington , d.c. , and its computer facility in arlington , virginia , from september 2005 through february 2006 .
recognizing the importance of securing the information systems of federal agencies , congress enacted the federal information security management act of 2002 ( fisma ) to strengthen the security of information and systems within federal agencies .
a primary reason for these weaknesses is that fdic has not yet fully implemented its information security program .
access controls include ( 1 ) user accounts and passwords , ( 2 ) access rights and permissions , ( 3 ) network services , ( 4 ) configuration assurance , ( 5 ) audit and monitoring of security - related events , and ( 6 ) physical security .
fdic has not effectively implemented information security controls to properly protect the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of its financial and sensitive information and information systems .
without proper safeguards , systems are unprotected from individuals and groups with malicious intent to intrude and use the access to obtain sensitive information , commit fraud , disrupt operations , or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks .
these weaknesses include not adequately securing personal firewall settings on laptop computers , using live data for testing , and not ensuring that only authorized application software changes are implemented .
these concerns are well - founded for a number of reasons , including the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents , the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools , the steady advance in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology , and the dire warnings of new and more destructive attacks to come .
computer - supported federal operations are likewise at risk .
to help fully implement the corporation's information security program , we recommend that the fdic chairman take the following five actions: consistently implement the corporation's documented policies and procedures related to information security , include security plans or requirements for nonmajor applications into the plans for general support systems , provide specialized training to individuals with significant security report weaknesses as closed in remedial action plans only when corrective actions have been completed , and update continuity of operations plans and test them for the new financial environment .
