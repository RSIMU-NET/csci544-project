even though these efforts represented some progress , navajo and hopi tribal officials have repeatedly expressed the tribes' frustrations with the pace of federal efforts to address uranium - related issues .
in october 2007 , the house committee on oversight and government reform held hearings on the health and environmental effects of uranium contamination on the navajo reservation .
doe also began monitoring groundwater contamination or implementing plans to address groundwater contamination at three of these sites .
among other efforts , from the 1970s to the mid - 2000s , epa surveyed 65 structures and replaced 2 that had elevated levels of radiation ; federal and tribal agencies and others sampled thousands of unregulated water sources to identify contamination ; and a navajo mine reclamation program addressed many of the physical hazards posed by abandoned mines .
these efforts on the whole have been sporadic , with some exceptions .
all five agencies were either directly involved with uranium mining and processing or with addressing the environmental and health effects of uranium contamination , or both , and included: epa , doe , the department of the interior's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) , the department of health and human services' indian health service ( ihs ) , and the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) .
according to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and other federal agencies , health effects — including lung cancer , bone cancer , and impaired kidney function — can result from exposure to elevated levels of uranium and other radionuclides .
the largest effort was conducted by the department of energy ( doe ) , which completed remedial actions at four uranium mill sites on the navajo reservation where uranium ore was processed under the uranium mill tailings radiation control act of 1978 , as amended ( umtrca ) .
after uranium mining on the navajo reservation ended , some federal and tribal agencies began to address different aspects of the legacy of uranium contamination .
based , in part , on information received in that hearing , in january 2008 , the committee requested that five federal agencies create a 5-year plan to address the effects of uranium contamination on navajo and hopi tribal lands .
additional appropriations .
nearly 30 years later , the navajo people continue to live with the environmental and health effects from mining operations: more than 500 abandoned mines are located across the reservation , some close to homes and communities , and an unknown number of homes and drinking water sources contain radioactive elements .
this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which federal agencies achieved the targets identified in the 2008 5-year plan , and the reasons why or why not ; ( 2 ) what is known about the scope of work , time frames , and estimated costs of fully addressing uranium contamination ; and ( 3 ) the key challenges , if any , faced by federal agencies in completing this work and the opportunities , if any , which may be present to help overcome these challenges .
potentially responsible parties , such as former owners or operators of mines , can be compelled to clean up the contamination or to pay cleanup costs under the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) .
