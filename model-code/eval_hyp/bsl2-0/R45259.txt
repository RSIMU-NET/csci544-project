congress could continue to explore its authority to affect policy , conduct oversight , and provide appropriations for federal activities that influence groundwater supply management in the united states .
in recent congresses , some members have introduced legislation that could affect how groundwater resources may be managed to better ensure a sufficient and reliable supply , and several such bills ( or portions of such bills ) have been enacted into law .
drought conditions and constrained supplies of surface water have helped to spur legislative action .
much of the recent congressional interest in groundwater has been broadly related to policies for increasing water supplies generally , as a response to recent droughts , and in preparation for future droughts .
these conditions continue to affect many regions in western states , although droughts can occur anywhere in the nation .
it also includes management responsibilities for certain federal reservations if the purposes of those reservations require water , such as some national monuments , national forests , military bases , and other federal land holdings .
for example , the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( 42 u.s.c .
in addition , the federal government is involved in groundwater monitoring and assessment and in aspects of groundwater recharge , storage , and recovery .
this report is intended to provide context and a broad summary of federal authorities and activities affecting the supply and use of groundwater resources .
managing groundwater resources largely has been the purview of states rather than the federal government .
whereas the states primarily manage groundwater supply , the federal government plays a more direct role in managing the nation's groundwater quality .
the federal role in managing groundwater includes activities under federal trust responsibilities to indian tribes and reservations .
authorizes federal cleanup and enforcement actions to respond to releases of hazardous substances to the environment , including groundwater .
in some cases , these issues overlap .
authorizes the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to regulate underground injection activities to protect underground sources of drinking water , including injection wells used for aquifer recharge .
how each state manages its groundwater resources differs and depends on a mix of common law emerging from the 19 th century , state law , court decisions , water settlements , and , to a lesser extent , federal law .
numerous bills introduced in the 115 th congress would address several groundwater - related topics .
in recent years , congressional interest in groundwater has generally been in three major areas aquifer storage , recharge , and recovery ; groundwater rights ( including among other things , groundwater / surface water interaction and federal reserved water rights ) ; and groundwater supply monitoring and assessment .
it serves as a water source for domestic use and as irrigation water for agriculture , and it is used in mining , oil and gas development , industrial processes , livestock , and thermoelectric power , among other uses .

this report focuses on issues related to groundwater supply , not groundwater quality .
the first part discusses general background related to groundwater supply and management , including selected major issues before congress .
the second part provides a more detailed primer on groundwater resources , including relevant federal activities and authorities .
