as a result of the proposed settlement , you asked us to ( 1 ) identify tobacco - related industries and summarize existing studies that assess the national and regional economic impacts of the tobacco industry , ( 2 ) examine smoking trends for u.s. and canadian youths , ( 3 ) estimate the potential effect of a settlement on state revenues from cigarette excise taxes , and ( 4 ) investigate the extent of interstate and international cigarette smuggling affecting the united states .
under the proposed agreement , the industry would pay about $368.5 billion over a period of 25 years , accept the food and drug administration's ( fda ) authority to regulate tobacco products , restrict the advertising of its products , and release internal research documents .
in return , the proposed settlement would resolve the present actions by the 40 state attorneys general , drop all punitive damages claims for past conduct , and grant the tobacco industry immunity from future class - action lawsuits .
in addition , we developed an economic model to estimate the potential lost revenues from state excise taxes as a result of an increase in the price of cigarettes .
on june 20 , 1997 , the nation's largest tobacco companies and 40 state attorneys general who had filed suit against the industry agreed on a settlement that , if implemented , would significantly change the way tobacco products are manufactured , marketed , and distributed in the united states .
to respond to your request , we analyzed government , industry , and academic studies that we identified through extensive literature searches and through discussions with recognized experts in government , industry , and academia .
further detail on our objectives , scope , and methodology can be found at the end of this report .
on september 17 , 1997 , the president announced five key goals that he believes should be included in any national tobacco settlement legislation: ( 1 ) reducing smoking by teens , through , among other things , a combination of industry payments and penalties ; ( 2 ) granting fda full authority to regulate the manufacturing , marketing , and sale of tobacco products ; ( 3 ) changing the way the tobacco industry does business , such as through restricting the marketing and promoting of tobacco to children , and requiring the industry to disclose scientific and health - related research ; ( 4 ) addressing other related public health goals , such as promoting smoking cessation , researching the health consequences of smoking , and further restricting smoking in the workplace and in public areas ; and ( 5 ) minimizing the impact of a national settlement on tobacco farmers and their communities .
the tobacco industry agreed to pay about $368.5 billion ( in 1997 dollars ) over a period of 25 years â€” subject to consumption or volume adjustment.annual payments would range from $8.5 billion to $15 billion .
among other things , these payments would be used to fund an extensive federal enforcement program , including a state - administered retail licensing system to stop minors from obtaining tobacco products ; an annual national counter - advertising and tobacco - control campaign ; a nationwide smoking cessation program ; and expenditures for states' health benefits programs .
