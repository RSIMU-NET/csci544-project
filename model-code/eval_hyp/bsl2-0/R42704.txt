on december 19 , 2014 , congress passed the carl levin and howard p. "buck" mckeon national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2015 .
increasingly acknowledged conditions , such as traumatic brain injuries ( tbi ) and post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , as well as accidents and other events while deployed , bring up new questions as to when a servicemember deserves a purple heart .
although congress has traditionally left many military award requirements to the executive branch , the constitution does allow congress to act in this area , and events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the purple heart .
new events and changes in military , political , or social conditions can generate debate over who is eligible for various military awards .
these changes tend to be controversial , especially with veterans groups .
congress has considered several pieces of legislation that would change who would be eligible to receive the purple heart , and under what conditions .
the wars in iraq and afghanistan have greatly increased the number of servicemembers receiving the purple heart award as well as the potential conditions under which they receive the award .
veterans groups often voice their views when congress or the president proposes making changes to expand eligibility for the purple heart .
requirements for military awards and decorations can change over time .
determining which actions and events make a servicemember qualified for receiving a purple heart , and whether expanding eligibility does a disservice to those who have already earned the award , are contentious elements of this debate .
these groups argue , for example , that a servicemember who acquires ptsd may not always deserve the same recognition as a servicemember killed or wounded in direct combat , while others contend that these medical conditions can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries and can have lasting effects on servicemembers' lives .
congressional offices often receive questions about purple heart eligibility from constituents , especially when eligibility rules change .
the number of these questions is likely to increase as servicemembers return from conflicts around the world and if eligibility requirements are again changed .
this report will examine the history of the purple heart and changes in eligibility over time as well as current issues facing congress .
the july 17 , 2015 , shooting of servicemembers at a marine recruiting office and a naval reserve center in chattanooga , tn , again prompted questions about applying the purple heart to terrorist attacks versus criminal acts .
section 571 of the ndaa for fy2015 expanded eligibility by redefining what should be considered an attack by a "foreign terrorist organization" for purposes of determining eligibility for the purple heart .
as a result , servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 shootings in little rock , ar , and at fort hood , tx , were awarded purple hearts in 2015 .
this legislation was reintroduced in the 115 th congress on january 13 , 2017 , as h.r .
this bill was referred to the house judiciary subcommittee on crime , terrorism , homeland security , and investigations but saw no further action in the 114 th congress .
544 , the private corrado piccoli purple heart preservation act of 2017 , and a related bill , s. 765 , was passed by the senate on august 3 , 2017 .
