the welfare reform law provided states several options for administering medicaid in a post - welfare - reform era .
there have also been concerns that , under the new law , people losing afdc or ssi benefits may not be adequately informed about their continued medicaid eligibility .
some estimates projected that over 1.5 million individuals could be involved in such redeterminations and that nearly 1 million previously eligible aliens and disabled children would no longer qualify for medicaid benefits .
however , many believed that state medicaid programs could be significantly affected , since states could use their newly authorized flexibility to change the eligibility criteria for cash assistance — which , prior to welfare reform , was often the basis for medicaid eligibility — or to limit medicaid coverage for aliens already receiving benefits .
to promote work rather than welfare dependence and to provide states more flexibility in designing their welfare programs , the new welfare reform law made a number of changes to the nation's cash assistance programs , including aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
previously , eligibility for cash assistance and medicaid benefits were directly linked by federal law .
few changes were made directly to medicaid as a result of welfare reform .
also unclear was the states' ability to administratively handle the potentially large number of individuals — such as aliens and disabled children — who might lose ssi benefits due to welfare reform and would need their continued eligibility for medicaid to be redetermined .
the law also had important implications for medicaid , which in fiscal year 1996 spent $160 billion to finance health care coverage for low - income families and blind , disabled , and elderly people .
in light of the potential for significant change and your interest in determining what medicaid - related actions states have taken in the first year of welfare reform , you asked us to briefly describe the medicaid - related options the welfare reform law gave states and discuss the approaches states have chosen ; identify the implications of these state choices for medicaid eligibles and for the states' administrative processes ; and identify steps states have taken or plan to take to educate and enroll medicaid eligibles , in view of their changing eligibility for cash assistance programs .
to identify the choices states have made for their medicaid programs and the resulting impact on beneficiaries and state administrative processes during the first full year of the law's implementation , we contacted officials from the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
states' responses to these options — and the resulting impact on beneficiaries and states — were uncertain at the time of the law's enactment .
welfare reform , however , generally severed that link .
to identify the medicaid - related options states were provided under welfare reform , we analyzed the law and interviewed issue area experts , including those representing the american public welfare association and the george washington university's center for health policy research .
during these visits and in subsequent follow - up contacts , we also asked state officials about their efforts to educate and enroll medicaid - eligible populations following welfare reform .
