importantly , epa has not been able to complete assessments of key chemicals of concern to public health , including dioxin , formaldehyde , trichloroethylene ( tce ) , naphthalene , and tetrachloroethylene ( perc ) ( see app .
however , epa's productivity in finalizing iris assessments is poor , and epa has a significant backlog of incomplete iris assessments and a growing number of outdated assessments .
in this context , my testimony today discusses ( 1 ) highlights of our march 2008 report , chemical assessments: low productivity and new interagency review process limit the usefulness and credibility of epa's integrated risk information system , ( 2 ) key aspects of epa's revised iris assessment process , released on april 10 , 2008 , and ( 3 ) progress epa has made in completing assessments in fiscal year 2008 .
thus , although iris assessments are not regulatory in nature , the quantitative iris values are likely to influence many risk management decisions and serve as a basis for regulatory consideration .
for our march 2008 report , we examined the outcome of steps epa has taken to ensure that iris contains current , credible chemical risk information ; to address the backlog of ongoing assessments ; and to respond to new requirements from the office of management and budget ( omb ) .
with risk assessment information , decision makers can make informed risk management decisions on how to protect public health , reflecting other important data and considerations , such as the costs and benefits of mitigating identified risks , the technological feasibility of managing risks , and the concerns of various stakeholders .
the development of health risk assessments is thus directly dependent on the development of toxicity assessments such as those developed in the iris program .
iris is therefore a critical component of epa's capacity to support scientifically sound risk management decisions , policies , and regulations .
we also examined the potential effects of planned changes to the iris assessment process on epa's ability to ensure that iris provides current , credible risk information .
containing epa's scientific position on the potential human health effects that may result from exposure to more than 540 chemicals in the environment , iris is one of the most significant tools that epa has developed to effectively support its mission of protecting people and the environment from harmful chemical exposures .
in conducting our work , we obtained and analyzed information on epa's productivity and the resources provided to the program for fiscal years 2000 through 2007 , user needs , and epa's assessment completion goals .
we also interviewed epa's national center for environmental assessment officials who manage the iris assessment program ; officials from other epa program offices and federal science and health agencies involved in the iris assessment process ; and officials from the department of defense , the department of energy ( doe ) , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and omb .
iris information can then be used with the results of exposure assessments ( typically conducted by epa's program or regional offices ) to provide an overall characterization of the public health risks for a given chemical in a given situation .
