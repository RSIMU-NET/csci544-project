our high - risk status reports are provided at the start of each new congress to help in setting congressional oversight agendas and to help in raising the priority and visibility of government programs needing transformation .
these reports also help congress and the executive branch carry out their responsibilities while improving the government's performance and enhancing its accountability for the benefit of the american people .
in addition , as we have repeatedly reported , our fragmented food safety system has resulted in inconsistent oversight , ineffective coordination , and inefficient use of resources .
together , the high - risk update and the recommendations for oversight can help congressional decision makers focus on the programmatic challenges facing the nation .
in this regard , i recently provided congressional leadership with a set of recommendations based on gao's work , including work on some areas we have designated as high risk , for its consideration in developing the oversight agenda of the 110th congress .
with 15 agencies collectively administering at least 30 laws related to food safety , the patchwork nature of the federal food safety oversight system calls into question whether the government can more efficiently and effectively protect our nation's food supply .
as a result , we added the federal oversight of food safety to our list of programs needing urgent attention and transformation in order to ensure that our national government functions in the most economical , efficient , and effective manner possible .
because of your continuing interest in the effective use of food safety resources , i will focus on three key points: ( 1 ) the role of gao's high - risk series in raising the priority and visibility of the need to transform federal oversight of food safety , ( 2 ) the fragmented nature of federal oversight of food safety , and ( 3 ) the need to address federal oversight of food safety as a 21st century challenge .
however , each year , about 76 million people contract a foodborne illness in the united states ; about 325,000 require hospitalization ; and about 5,000 die , according to the centers for disease control and prevention .
while progress on developing and implementing plans has been mixed , concerted efforts by agencies and ongoing attention by omb are critical .
top administration officials have expressed their commitment to ensuring that high - risk areas receive adequate attention and oversight .
key determinants include a demonstrated strong commitment to and top leadership support for addressing problems , the capacity to do so , a corrective action plan , and demonstrated progress in implementing corrective measures .
my testimony is based on published gao products that were developed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) has led an initiative to prompt agencies to develop detailed action plans for each area on our high - risk list .
further , to respond to the nation's pressing fiscal challenges , agencies may have to explore new ways to achieve their missions .
further , omb has encouraged agencies to consult with us regarding the problems our past work has identified and the many recommendations for corrective actions we have made .
