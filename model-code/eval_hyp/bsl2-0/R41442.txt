other major funding programs are the urbanized area formula program ( 43% of funding in safetea ) , the fixed - guideway ( rail ) modernization program ( 16% ) , and the bus and bus - related facilities capital program ( 9% ) .
this report discuses major issues that congress may consider in a long - term reauthorization .
the new starts program underwent several significant changes in safetea , and a long - term reauthorization of the surface transportation program provides a major opportunity for congress to consider more changes .
rail transit systems , more so than buses , are typically very long - lived assets that require major future financial commitments for operation and maintenance .
moreover , the new starts program , probably more than any other federal transit program , has implications for the future of transit and transit policy .
for example , the program was extended through december 31 , 2010 , under the hiring incentives to restore employment ( hire ) act ( p.l .
these include the size of the overall program and how those funds are distributed in terms of project size and the required local match ; the types of transit modes that are eligible and favored within the program ; the new starts approval process , including the way in which projects are evaluated and rated for funding ; and private sector participation in new starts projects .
the federal transit program is authorized by the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea ) ( p.l .

during the five years of safetea ( fy2005 through fy2009 ) , the new starts program accounted for about 18% of authorized transit funding .

the remaining 15% of funding authorized goes for several other smaller programs , state and metropolitan planning , research , and fta operations .
new starts has funded the development of bus rapid transit ( brt ) and ferries , as these are eligible under the definition of fixed - guideway , but the vast majority of funding has gone to transit rail systems .
the new starts program is one element of the federal transit program that is administered by the federal transit administration ( fta ) within the department of transportation .
public transit , as defined in federal law , does not include transportation by school bus , intercity bus , or intercity passenger rail ( amtrak ) .
it concludes with some thoughts on the longer - term relevance of new starts for the future of public transit .
between 1985 and 2008 , consequently , rail transit route - mileage almost doubled , with light rail mileage more than tripling , commuter rail mileage doubling , and subway mileage growing by 25% .
new starts grants tend to be relatively large , and securing funding through the competitive grant making process often determines whether a project moves forward .
the new starts program provides federal funds to public transit agencies on a largely competitive basis for the construction of new fixed - guideway transit systems and the expansion of existing fixed - guideway systems ( 49 u.s.c .
