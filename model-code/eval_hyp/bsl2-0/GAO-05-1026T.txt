the effects are not trivial ; the zebra mussel alone is estimated to have caused $750 million to $1 billion in costs between 1989 and 2000 .
numerous harmful species have been introduced into u.s. waters via ballast water and have caused serious economic and ecologic damage .
today , i am going to provide some information on the legislative and regulatory history of ballast water management and discuss some issues that pose challenges for the federal government's program for preventing the introduction of invasive species into u.s. waters from ships' ballast water discharges , including an update on concerns that we identified in our 2002 report .
as you know , many of these species are now permanent residents in u.s. ecosystems and have significantly altered the structure of these systems , or promise to do so in the future .
to update our work from 2002 , we examined relevant statutes , regulations , and agency policies and documents .
we also gathered recent data on compliance with current regulations .
the environment and economy of the chesapeake bay , san francisco bay , puget sound , and other coastal areas have also been affected by species transported in ballast water .
we reported in 2002 that at least 160 nonnative aquatic species had become established in the great lakes since the 1800s , more than one - third of which had been introduced in the prior 30 years .
in addition , we interviewed agency officials and representatives of the shipping industry , technology developers , state agencies , environmental organizations , and academic researchers .
this problem is not confined to the great lakes , however .
ballast water is considered a major , although not the only , source of those introductions .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss actions to address the introduction of harmful invasive species via the ballast water in ships .
we conducted our work from march through august 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
congress reauthorized appropriations for and amended that law in 1996 , making it more national in scope .
congress recognized ballast water as a serious problem in 1990 with the passage of the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance prevention and control act , legislation intended to help reduce the number of species introduced into u.s. waters , focusing on the great lakes .
the federal government has been taking steps to address the introduction of potentially invasive species via the ballast water in ships for well over a decade .
given the pace and expansion of global trade , the movement of additional invasive species to these and other ecosystems can only be expected to continue .
notably , invasive species are found in virtually all of our coastal bays and estuaries â€” resources that are typically enormously productive and support multibillion dollar commercial fisheries and recreation industries .
the cross - cut budget effort is intended to encourage agencies to , among other things , develop shared goals and strategies , and to promote cooperation and coordination on invasive species issues .
in addition to these domestic developments , members of the united nation's international maritime organization have adopted a convention on ballast water management that , if ratified by a sufficient number of countries , could affect the global fleet .
