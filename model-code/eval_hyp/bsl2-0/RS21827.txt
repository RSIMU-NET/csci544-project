congress is now exploring federal standards for some aspects of state regulation ofinsurance .
since then , markets have not really integrated , and regulatory silos - - with fewexceptions - - remain intact .
rs21827 - - insurance regulation after the gramm - leach - bliley act april 26 , 2004 summary congress passed the gramm - leach - bliley act in 1999 , anticipatingwholesale integration in financial services .
thisreport was written under the supervision of barbara miles , government and finance division , and will be updatedas events warrant .
congress passed the gramm - leach - bliley act ( 1 ) ( the glb act ) in 1999 to enhance competition among financial services providersand to modernize their regulation .
 ( 2 ) competitionamong those providers has evolved differently than most observers expected itwould , as fewer than expected cross - sectoral mergers and consolidations have occurred .
 ( 3 ) mergers and consolidation have insteadoccurred largely within sectors , though companies within each sector are producing and distributing a broader rangeof financialproducts .
 ( 11 ) the concept of functional regulation as implemented in the glb act has been praised and criticized .
 ( 12 ) others criticize it for not modernizing financial services regulation at all but rathercombining functional and institutional regulation , ( 13 ) preserving the status quo , ( 14 ) orcreating bias .
 ( 21 ) .
 ( 4 ) the glb act preserved the role of the federal reserve board as an umbrella supervisor for holding companies , ( 5 ) and it alsoexpressly preserved state regulation of insurance .
some praise it for openingcommunication among sectoral regulators .
 ( 6 ) it allowed national banks to underwrite insurance in a financial holding companyaffiliate ( 7 ) and to sell insurance .
accordingly , the bill is intended to ensure that banking activities are regulated by bank regulators , securitiesactivities are regulatedby securities regulators , and insurance activities are regulated by insurance regulators .
 ( 45 ) .
 ( 9 ) the states were not , however,to frustrate congressional intent by discriminating against banks or theirsubsidiaries or affiliates .
 ( 44 ) senator hollings , ranking member ofthe senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation has introduced s. 1373 , the insurance consumer protection act , to mandate federal regulation of insurance .
itis inefficient and impractical to expect a regulator to have or to develop expertise in regulating all aspects offinancial services .
 ( 8 ) these insurance activities were to "be conducted ina manner that is consistent with applicablestate regulation. .
it remains tobe seenwhether such proposed improvements in insurance regulation will improve the operation of the risk transfermarketplace generally inthe u.s. or the regulation of insurers as financial intermediaries .
 ( 20 ) the board has alsoestablished resource centers to monitor developments in the insurance industry andhas undertaken cross - training with various state insurance supervisors .
the glb act required that state insurance regulators , the federal reserve board , and federal banking regulatorscoordinate effortsand share information about insurers and affiliated depositary institutions .
 ( 16 ) the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) ( 17 ) has reported that , as of february 2003,46 states had signed regulatory cooperation agreements with the office of thriftsupervision ; 43 states , with the office of the comptroller of the currency ; 47 states , with the federal depositinsurancecooperation , and 38 states , with the federal reserve .
