you subsequently asked us to assess the ( 1 ) reported status of 23 of the agencies under the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) in performing effective patch management practices , ( 2 ) tools and services available to federal agencies to perform patch management , ( 3 ) challenges to performing patch management , and ( 4 ) additional steps that can be taken to mitigate the risks created by software vulnerabilities .
since 1995 , nearly 13,000 security vulnerabilities in software products have been reported .
while federal agencies can mitigate the risk of cyber attacks by keeping their systems up to date with appropriate patches , applying and maintaining these patches is challenging .
in that testimony , we stated that patch management is one means to address the increasing vulnerabilities to cybersecurity .
on september 10 , 2003 , we testified before the subcommittee on technology , information policy , intergovernmental relations and the census on the role of software patch management in mitigating the risks of cyber incidents .
with the increasing sophistication of technology , attacks that once took weeks or months to propagate over the internet now take only hours or even minutes .
to address these objectives , we conducted an extensive search of professional information technology ( it ) security literature .
the process of applying software patches to fix flaws , referred to as patch management , is a critical process used to help secure computing systems from attacks .
flaws in software code can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers may attempt to exploit and cause significant damage to federal computer systems .
we also reviewed research studies and reports about cybersecurity - related vulnerabilities to update information provided in our testimony and consulted our prior reports and testimonies on information security .
in addition , we interviewed private - sector and federal officials about their patch management experiences , practices , and challenges .
federal agencies rely extensively on computerized information systems and their software to carry out their missions .
the federal government has taken several steps to address security vulnerabilities that affect agency systems , including efforts to improve patch management .
the increasing complexity and size of software programs contribute to the growth in software flaws .
specific actions include ( 1 ) requiring agencies to annually report on their patch management practices as part of their implementation of fisma , ( 2 ) identifying vulnerability remediation as a critical area of focus in the president's national strategy to secure cyberspace , and ( 3 ) creating us â€“ cert .
figure 1 illustrates the dramatic growth in security vulnerabilities over these years .
the sophistication and effectiveness of cyber attacks have steadily advanced .
the 2003 fisma reporting instructions that specifically address patch management practices include agencies' status on ( 1 ) developing an inventory of major it systems , ( 2 ) confirming that patches have been tested and installed in a timely manner , ( 3 ) subscribing to a now - discontinued governmentwide patch notification service , and ( 4 ) addressing patching of security vulnerabilities in configuration requirements .
agencies have implemented common effective patch management practices inconsistently .
while most flaws do not create security vulnerabilities , the potential for these errors reflects the difficulty and complexity involved in delivering trustworthy code .
