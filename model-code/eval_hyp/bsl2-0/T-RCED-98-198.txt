to receive their awards , banks must prove that they have made eligible loans or investments , but the fund has no long - term monitoring role in this program .
the bea program rewards banks for increased lending and investments in cdfis or in distressed communities .
to date , the fund has sought to expand access to credit and other financial services in distressed communities primarily through two programs â€” the cdfi and the bank enterprise award ( bea ) programs .
community - based financial institutions have improved the economic well - being of economically distressed communities and their residents through lending and investments tailored to these communities .
our testimony today focuses on the first year's performance of the cdfi and bea programs and identifies opportunities for improving their effectiveness .
as you know , access to credit and investment capital is essential for creating and retaining jobs , developing affordable housing , revitalizing neighborhoods , and promoting the development and growth of small businesses .
we found that the performance measures in the assistance agreements generally assess activities ( such as the number of loans made ) rather than accomplishments reflecting the results of activities ( such as the number of new low - income homeowners ) .
because participants in the cdfi program are just beginning to report preliminary results , our discussion of this program will focus on the fund's progress in developing performance measures for awardees and systems to monitor and evaluate their progress .
in contrast , participants in the bea program have largely completed the activities for which they are rewarded ; therefore , we will discuss the impact of the program on banks' investments in cdfis and distressed communities .
the cdfi program provides financial and technical assistance to a wide range of for - profit and nonprofit financial institutions to support their activities in distressed communities and monitors their performance over a period of at least 5 years .
finally , our testimony will review the fund's progress in meeting the strategic planning requirements of the government performance and results act of 1993 ( results act ) .
in 1994 , recognizing that such community - based institutions were relatively few in number and small in size and often had difficulty meeting the demand for their services , the congress created the cdfi fund .
these agreements are consistent with the program's objectives .
the fund has developed reporting requirements for awardees to collect information for monitoring their performance and is developing postaward monitoring procedures for assessing their compliance with their assistance agreements .
we further found that although the performance measures in the assistance agreements are generally related to specific goals , they do not always address all key aspects of the goals , and most assistance agreements lack baseline data that would facilitate tracking progress over time .
these shortcomings are similar to those in other federal agencies' initial efforts to comply with the results act and omb's associated guidance .
because the cdfi act provides no specific guidance for evaluating performance measures , we used the results act's standards .
according to fund officials and cdfis in our case studies , this emphasis on activity measures is due , in part , to difficulties in isolating and assessing the results of community development initiatives , which may not be observable for many years and may be subject to factors outside the awardees' control .
