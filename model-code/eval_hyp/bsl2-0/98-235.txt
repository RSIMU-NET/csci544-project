u.s. greenhouse gas emissions ( mmtce ) ,1990-2001 source: environmental protection agency , inventory of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990-2001 ( april 2003 ) , epa 430r03004 .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) publishes the official emissions data annually .

u.s. baseline year greenhouse gas emissions source: epa , inventory of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990 - 2001 ) april 2003 , epa 430r03004 .
 ( 12 ) the united states also from timeto time reports on emissions andexplains its climate change programs in the climate action report ( car ) to theunited nations ; the third car was published in 2002 .
 ( 14 ) besides actual quantities of emissions , an alternative measure of a nation's contribution to global warming is "greenhouse gas intensity of the economy" - - thatis , emissions per unit of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
for the united states , greenhouse gas intensity hasbeen declining since at least the 1980s ; for the 1990s , the decline in intensity wasabout 10% , based on net emissions ( 15 ) ( see table 3 ) .
in effect , this measurefocuses on the efficiency of the economy in terms of greenhouse gas emissions: themore efficient , the fewer emissions per dollar of economic output and thus the lowerthe "greenhouse gas intensity. .
following international convention , epa presents the data in teragrams ofco 2 equivalent ; crs has converted thefigures to million metric tons of carbon equivalent ( mmtce ) , a metric that is more familiar to most u.s.policymakers .
each annual report includes updated estimates based on methodological and data revisions,although such changes are usually small .
however , any changes tend to be modest , seldom affecting totalsmuch more than plus or minus 1% , except for sequestration figures , which have beensubject to larger changes .
revisions are discussed at some length ineach report .
 ( 13 ) the u.s. baselines for the unfccc and the kyoto protocol are shown in table 2 .
pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change , the united stateshas published "national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinksof all greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol , using comparable methodologies... agreed upon by the conference of the parties. .
the emissions baselines shown in table 2 are not immutable .
the criteria for calculating emissions agreed upon by the conference ofparties hinge on both current technical knowledge and policy judgments .
for the unfccc commitment , the baseline is 1990 emissions , or 1,675mmtce ; if the united states had acceded to the kyoto targets , the baseline wouldhave been 1,676 mmtce , a negligible difference .
newtechnical information can change factors , for example concerning calculation ofgreenhouse gas equivalents ; and policy judgments can be adjusted , for exampleconcerning the time frame for calculating effects .
in addition , a few technical issuesremain unresolved , for example in assigning emissions from fuels burned ininternational travel .
