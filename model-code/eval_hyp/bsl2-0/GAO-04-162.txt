in august 2003 , va released its draft cares plan , which presented a wide range of health care service enhancement proposals based on veterans' projected health care needs and related capacity requirements .
to enhance services for veterans across its entire health care system , va began a nationwide strategic planning initiative in october 2000 , known as capital asset realignment for enhanced services ( cares ) .
the cares process is designed to address , among other things , veterans' access to health care and the cost and quality of health care .
as part of this initiative , va conducted analyses of needs and alternatives at both the national and local levels , using the 77 designated health care markets in va's health care networks .
we support the goals of this initiative , which was undertaken in response to our 1999 recommendation that va restructure its delivery of health care to reduce spending on underutilized or inefficient buildings and , in turn , reinvest the savings in enhanced health care resources closer to where veterans live .
over 7 million veterans are enrolled nationwide ; during fiscal year 2002 , almost 4.3 million veterans received va health care , at a cost of $22.6 billion .
veterans residing in chattanooga , tennessee , have encountered difficulties accessing va inpatient and outpatient health care services .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates a nationwide health care system that is organized into 21 integrated health care networks comprising over 160 hospitals and 600 community - based outpatient clinics .
after reviewing the plan and collecting additional information , an independent cares commission will , in february 2004 , make specific recommendations to the secretary of veterans affairs for restructuring va's health care system ; the secretary is expected to make a final decision within 30 days of receiving the commission's recommendation .
to measure the accessibility of its health care services , va established guidelines for travel times and waiting times .
as part of its cares initiative , va established national travel time guidelines to help define reasonable access to health care .
following the 1999 report , va took several steps specifically designed to enhance veterans' access to health care , including expanding service capacity at the chattanooga clinic and contracting for inpatient hospital care and outpatient primary and specialty care with local providers in chattanooga , including the erlanger medical center .
at your request , we assessed how ( 1 ) chattanooga - area veterans' access to inpatient hospital and outpatient primary and specialty care compared to va's established travel time and appointment waiting time guidelines and ( 2 ) va's draft cares plan , if implemented , could affect chattanooga - area veterans' access to such care .
for example , in a 1999 report , va's inspector general ( ig ) cited waiting times for outpatient specialty care that frequently exceeded 90 days , which raised concern about va's capacity to meet veterans' health care needs at the chattanooga clinic and the nearest va hospitals located in murfreesboro and nashville , tennessee .
prior to its cares initiative , va had already established 30 days or less as a reasonable waiting time for initial primary care and outpatient specialty care appointments .
