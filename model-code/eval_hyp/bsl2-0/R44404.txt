funding for cybersecurity activities has also risen over the years .
although a methodologically rigorous total for these investments has not been calculated , an understanding of how the federal government applies resources to enhance its cybersecurity is necessary for congress to provide constructive oversight and prevent waste .
recent high profile breaches of federal government systems , including those of the white house , state department , and office of personnel management , have called into question the ability of the federal government to secure its data and networks adequately in today's threat environment .
cyberattacks against the u.s. government and the nation have been reported with increasing frequency since 2006 .
this report provides an overview of how the federal government has applied resources to promote cybersecurity in the past , and options for how it could choose to do so in the future .
there is a great deal of interest in the cybersecurity activities of the federal government .
each of these includes spending on information technology infrastructure ( i.e. , hardware and software ) and services ( including the costs of personnel ) .
for this report , federal government spending on cybersecurity will be analyzed in three ways: agency spending to protect its own systems , networks , and data ; agency spending to protect other governmental systems , networks , and data ; and agency spending to protect non - federal it systems , networks , and data .
there are several different reasons for interest in various calculations of federal spending on cybersecurity .
after reviewing these various cybersecurity responsibilities and potential ways to assess federal spending to meet them , this report will analyze three sources often cited as totals of cybersecurity spending , and discuss what would be necessary to provide an authoritative total that could support oversight efforts .
this type can also be divided into two categories: direct funding — usually in the form of grants or other direct financing — and services — which could include training , technical assistance , regulatory efforts , information sharing efforts , or other programs where the government helps facilitate cybersecurity functions of outside organizations .
an authoritative top - line number for federal government spending on cybersecurity cannot be calculated , however , without an explicit definition of what such a total encompasses and consistent reporting of data from all federal agencies .
as such , neither the president's nor the agency budget justifications , nor the fisma report ( both discussed below ) can be considered complete and accurate representations of how much the federal government is spending on cybersecurity .
the first two types of spending can be termed "internal" spending , as they relate to the government dealing with its own cybersecurity responsibilities within the federal .gov domain .
the third type can be termed "external" spending , as it relates to the government promoting cybersecurity to elements beyond its direct control .
at the agency level , there may be an interest in looking at spending on cybersecurity as part of an effort to compare the level of activity across the government .
one might ask how much the government spends on cybersecurity in an attempt to gauge a level of commitment to confronting the issue .
