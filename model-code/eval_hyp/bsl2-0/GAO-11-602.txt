this report provides ( 1 ) information on policies and measures airlines , federal agencies , and other entities have in place to prevent international parental child abductions involving airline flights and ( 2 ) options federal agencies , airlines , nongovernmental organizations , and others could consider to prevent international parental child abductions involving airline flights , as well as the advantages and limitations of those options .
we met with officials from the dhs and the departments of justice ( doj ) , state , and transportation ( dot ) , and seven nongovernmental child advocacy organizations .
in determining policies and measures that are in place to prevent these types of abductions , we examined relevant laws and regulations .
preventing abductions involving airline flights , however , can be difficult .
during these meetings , we obtained and analyzed information related to major policies and measures in place to prevent such abductions .
although the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — in collaboration with the airlines — screens all travelers boarding international flights , the united states does not generally exercise exit controls on its borders that would prevent u.s. citizens holding a valid passport from leaving the country with a child .
since 2000 , the annual number of new international child parental abduction cases for which parents requested department of state ( state department ) assistance has nearly tripled .
thus , prevention of international parental child abductions , including through air travel , is critical to ensure that parents are not separated from their children for a long period or indefinitely .
you requested that we study the prevention of international parental child abductions involving airline flights .
in addition , we received information from eight cross - continental airlines regarding their policies and measures to prevent international parental child abductions .
we then designed and implemented a web - based survey of domestic and foreign airlines , as well as nongovernmental child advocacy organizations to obtain their views regarding the effectiveness , advantages , limitations and key issues of two specific options for further preventing these types of abductions involving airline flights .
the state department reported that , from fiscal year 2007 through 2009 , it received 3,011 parental abduction requests for assistance in returning 4,365 children to the united states from other countries .
we also met with and obtained and analyzed information provided by two airline associations to determine what policies and measures airlines have in place to prevent international parental child abductions .
in determining additional options that federal agencies and others could consider to prevent abductions involving airline flights , we developed a list of hypothetical options from the federal agencies , nongovernmental child advocacy organizations , and airline associations mentioned above .
although 36 percent of these children were abducted to a bordering country , the nonborder countries with the most child abductions — the united kingdom , germany , india , japan , brazil , and australia — almost all involve cross - oceanic travel and , therefore , likely involved the parent and child leaving the united states aboard an airline flight .
once a child is abducted from this country to another , the laws , policies , and procedures of the foreign country determine whether and how the child will be returned .
