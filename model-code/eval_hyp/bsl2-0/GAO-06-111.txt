the challenges the department of defense ( dod ) faces in managing its reserve forces and allocating its resources across services and programs are some of the many issues that we have highlighted to congress as the nation entered the 21st century .
the army also hopes the model will increase deployment predictability for army national guard soldiers , who have been heavily involved in recent operations and must balance their military duties with civilian careers .
the post - september 11 increase in the army national guard's responsibilities , particularly its increased involvement in overseas operations , raises concerns about whether the army national guard has the equipment it needs to continue to support operations in the future .
while army officials anticipate guard involvement to decline somewhat in 2006 , the tempo of operations over the long term remains uncertain .
the army recognizes that it needs to transform its forces , including the national guard , to better meet the emerging threats of the 21st century and is undertaking two initiatives designed to enhance the capability of active and reserve forces .
in addition , the army national guard must use its allotted equipment to perform other domestic responsibilities , including responding to natural emergencies or incidents of civil unrest .
in addition , the army is in the process of developing a rotational force model in which active and reserve forces would progress through a cycle of increasing readiness , culminating in the availability of a specified number of units for deployment if needed .
one of the army's key initiatives — called the modular force initiative — is a multibillion dollar effort to restructure the entire army .
it involves increasing the flexibility and responsiveness of the force by converting from a division - based structure to smaller brigade combat teams and increasing the pool of units available for deployment .
historically , the army national guard has been structured as a follow - on force that supports the active army in overseas conflicts , and as such , guard units have not been resourced with all of the equipment and personnel they require for their missions .
and , in august 2003 and september 2004 , we reported on several reserve mobilization issues , including the limited use of the individual ready reserve and long - term availability issues .
however , army national guard members now comprise 31 percent of the ground forces in iraq .
we have previously reported on how the army national guard and army reserve have been used in recent operations .
in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and the subsequent launch of the global war on terrorism , the army national guard has been called upon to play a significant role in supporting active army forces overseas while , at the same time , taking on new homeland defense missions , such as protecting critical infrastructure — all of which require that the army national guard have sufficient quantities and types of equipment items .
in 2004 , we reported on the effect of the continuing high use of national guard forces and challenges to prepare the guard for future overseas and domestic missions .
instead , it was assumed that there would be sufficient time for units to obtain the remainder of their resources prior to deployment .
