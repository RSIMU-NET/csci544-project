within the last decade , congress has passed and amended legislation requiring dod to conduct strategic human capital planning efforts for the department's overall civilian workforce , its civilian senior leader workforce , and its financial management workforce .
to successfully address such complex challenges as national security , and other evolving national issues , it is necessary for dod to attract and retain skilled personnel .
for fiscal year 2015 , dod budgeted approximately $74 billion for a civilian workforce of approximately 782,000 full - time equivalents .
however , until dod aligns its strategic workforce plan with the budget process and other strategic management initiatives , such as those to address recruitment , retention , and readiness issues , both dod and congressional decision makers may not have visibility over the areas most in need of attention .
we discuss dod's progress on the plan and related areas — including dod's response and any recommendations implemented — in further detail later in this report .
three important elements of workforce planning include determining the critical skills and competencies necessary to achieve programmatic goals , conducting gap analyses , and developing strategies that are tailored to address any identified gaps .
while the office of personnel management , individual agencies such as dod , and congress have taken important steps over the last few years to better position the government to close current and emerging critical skills gaps that are undermining agencies' abilities to meet their vital missions , the area remains high risk because more work is needed in implementing specific corrective strategies for addressing critical skills gaps and evaluating their results .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 mandates gao to report to congressional defense committees on dod's plan within 180 days of its submission .
more recently , in september 2010 and again in september 2012 , we found that , although dod had demonstrated some progress in addressing the legislative requirements related to its civilian human capital strategic workforce plan , several key elements continued to be missing from the process — including such elements as competency - gap analyses and monitoring of progress .
specifically , section 115b of title 10 of the united states code ( section 115b ) , enacted in october 2009 , requires dod to develop and submit to congressional defense committees on a biennial basis a strategic workforce plan to shape and improve the department's civilian workforce , and includes a list of specific reporting requirements such as conducting assessments of current and future critical skills and competencies of dod's civilian workforce .
dod's civilian workforce performs a wide variety of duties and responsibilities , including mission - essential combat - support functions — such as logistics , support , and maintenance — that traditionally have been performed by the uniformed military .
we first reported on dod's need for strategic workforce plans for its civilian workforce in 2004 , and since have published several reports on dod's strategic workforce in february 2008 , we found that dod did not address most plans .
through greater alignment , dod can help to better ensure that its strategic workforce plan appropriately addresses the human - capital challenges of the future and better contributes to the agency's efforts to meet its missions and goals .
