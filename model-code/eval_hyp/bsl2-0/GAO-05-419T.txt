last fiscal year alone , dod had goals to recruit more than 180,000 personnel into its active duty forces and more than 120,000 personnel into its reserve components .
as you know , this subcommittee and others have raised concerns about dod's ability to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of personnel who possess required skills and experience .
my statement , which focuses only on enlisted personnel , will address our preliminary findings with respect to ( 1 ) the extent to which the active duty , reserve , and national guard components have met their overall recruiting and retention goals ; ( 2 ) the degree to which the components have met their recruiting and retention goals for selected , hard - to - fill critical occupations ; and ( 3 ) steps the components have taken to enhance their recruitment and retention efforts .
moreover , dod must retain tens of thousands of personnel each year to sustain its active duty , reserve , and guard forces .
to meet its human capital needs , the department of defense ( dod ) must convince several hundred thousand people to join the military each year , the majority of whom are recent high school graduates .
mr. chairman , we expect to complete our evaluation of the services' recruitment and retention efforts by august and issue our report this fall .
dod has made enhancements to existing programs and introduced new programs in recent years to improve its ability to recruit and retain servicemembers .
individual components have also implemented changes .
the work done in preparation for this hearing was conducted from february to march 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
findings presented here are preliminary , and we will assess the reliability of data provided to us by dod as we complete our evaluation .
the military components generally met their overall recruiting and retention goals over the past 5 fiscal years .
however , some are beginning to experience difficulties in meeting their overall recruiting and retention goals for fiscal year 2005 .
thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss our preliminary observations on recruitment and retention issues within the active and reserve components .
in addition , the army generally reduced its overall retention goals from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003 .
finally , the army and marine corps components are increasing their recruiting forces to meet their additional recruiting challenges .
these programs include increasing the eligibility for and size of enlistment and reenlistment bonuses and educational benefits , and the number of recruiters .
the army plans to add 965 recruiters to its recruiter force in fiscal year 2005 , for a total force of 6,030 recruiters , and the marine corps plans to add 425 recruiters to its recruiter force by fiscal year 2007 , bringing its total recruiter force to 3,025 recruiters .
selective reenlistment bonuses are designed to provide an incentive for an adequate number of qualified midcareer enlisted members to reenlist in designated critical occupations where retention levels are insufficient to sustain current or projected levels necessary for a service to accomplish its mission .
personnel who sign up for shorter extensions will receive a smaller bonus ; personnel who extend for 1 additional year , for example , will receive $8,000 .
