specifically , we addressed ( 1 ) the funding made available to rebuild iraq's oil and electricity sectors and the factors that may affect iraq's ability to meet its future funding needs , ( 2 ) the u.s. goals for the oil and electricity sectors and progress in achieving these goals , and ( 3 ) the key challenges the u.s. government faces in helping iraq restore its oil and electricity sectors .
oil export revenues account for over half of iraq's gross domestic product and over 90 percent of its revenues .
this revenue is essential to iraq's ability to provide for its needs , including reconstruction .
to accomplish our objectives , we reviewed and analyzed u.s. , iraqi , donor government , united nations ( un ) , international monetary fund ( imf ) , and world bank reports and data .
gao's review of reconstruction efforts in iraq , done under the comptroller general's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative , examined u.s. activities directed at rebuilding the oil and electricity sectors .
in addition , an inadequate and unreliable supply of electricity affects both public perceptions of the government's ability to deliver basic services and the productivity of iraq's oil sector , which is highly dependent on electricity .
both sectors are crucial to rebuilding the economy .
since 2003 , the u.s. government has provided several billion dollars in reconstruction funds to help restore iraq's crude oil production and exports and improve iraq's electrical generating capacity , transmission , distribution , and monitoring systems .
iraq's crude oil reserves , estimated at 115 billion barrels , are the third largest in the world .
we analyzed data on iraq's 2006 and 2007 budgets and 2006 budget expenditures .
we examined data on iraqi oil production from the department of state's iraq reconstruction and management office ( irmo ) and the department of energy's energy information administration ( eia ) .
during our field work in washington , d.c. ; baghdad , iraq ; and amman , jordan , we met with officials from the department of state , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , the department of defense ( dod ) , the department of the treasury , and the department of energy .
we found these data to be sufficiently reliable for comparing iraq's intended ministry expenditures and determining that iraq has not been able to fully expend its budget in certain budget categories .
the iraqi government inherited an oil and electricity infrastructure that was greatly deteriorated due to the previous regime's neglect , international sanctions , and years of conflict , looting , and vandalism .
during our two trips to iraq and jordan , we met with iraqi , un , imf , world bank , donor country ( japan and european union ) , private sector , and u.s. officials .
the ministries of oil and electricity have encountered difficulties spending their existing capital improvements budgets , and their future budgets are subject to the volatility of oil revenues .
we also interviewed u.s. , iraqi , and un officials at a november 2006 electricity conference sponsored by the un development programme ( undp ) at the dead sea , jordan .
