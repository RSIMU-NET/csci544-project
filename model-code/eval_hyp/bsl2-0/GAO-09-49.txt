army and marine corps forces currently collect biometrics data ( fingerprints , iris scans , and facial images ) from ( 1 ) persons seeking access to u.s. installations in iraq and afghanistan , ( 2 ) detainees , and ( 3 ) persons encountered by u.s. forces during military operations .
in accordance with this and other laws and regulations , dod , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the department of state ( dos ) share biometrics information .
in military activities , dod uses biometrics to identify and verify individuals encountered in the field as friend , foe , or neutral ; to operate detention facilities ; to protect dod personnel at expeditionary bases in theater ( force protection ) ; and to recover and identify u.s. personnel in afghanistan and iraq .
for example , dod uses biometrics to verify its common credential and to support access controls .
while a number of biometrics databases exist across the federal government , there are three major federal biometrics databases that include , among other data sets , information on known and suspected terrorists: ( 1 ) the fbi's integrated automated fingerprint identification system ( iafis ) ; ( 2 ) dod's automated biometric identification system ( abis ) , which is collocated with iafis ; and ( 3 ) the dhs automated biometric identification system ( ident ) , which is used by dhs for border patrol , customs , naturalization , and counterterrorism activities , as well as by dos as part of its visa approval process .
homeland security presidential directive 6 , issued in september 2003 , states that it is the policy of the united states to develop , integrate , and maintain terrorist information , and to use that terrorist information as appropriate and to the full extent permitted by law to support certain screening and other processes , including military , intelligence , law enforcement , immigration , and visa processes .
biometrics data , and the sharing of these data among federal agencies , are important to the united states' broader national security mission beyond dod's operations in afghanistan and iraq .
several dod organizations are involved in developing guidance on the collection and use of biometrics data .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act created an information sharing environment , defined as an approach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security information , with a program manager responsible for information sharing across the federal government .
latent fingerprints are also recovered in combat zones from unknown individuals who may be foes or neutral .
biometrics — measurements of unique personal characteristics , such as fingerprints , irises , and faces , to identify an unfamiliar person — have become an important tool in these operations , as well as in the department of defense's ( dod ) business functions and military activities .
within dod , the deputy secretary of defense , in a january 2007 memorandum , stated that dod would immediately adopt the practice of sharing unclassified dod biometrics data with other u.s. departments and agencies with counterterrorism missions .
dod , the fbi , dhs , and dos have established formal and informal arrangements , pursuant to applicable u.s. laws and regulations and international agreements , regarding the sharing of information among the iafis , abis , and ident databases .
