the mission of the environmental protection agency ( epa ) is to protect human health and the environment .
biomonitoring studies for certain chemicals , such as lead , have been ongoing for decades , but recent advances in analytic methods have allowed scientists to measure more chemicals in smaller concentrations .
to help epa achieve this objective , the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) authorizes it to regulate the manufacture , processing , and distribution of chemicals .
moreover , children may be more vulnerable to harm from these chemicals than adults because their biological functions are still developing and their size and behavior may expose them to proportionately higher doses .
epa uses such risk assessments to determine if it needs to take any risk management actions , such as prohibiting or restricting the manufacture , processing , or distribution of a chemical .
some of these have the potential to cause cancer or birth defects .
a crucial tool in this regulatory process is chemical risk assessment , which involves determining the extent to which populations will be exposed to a chemical and assessing how this exposure affects human health .
a recent proliferation of biomonitoring data has provided new insights into the general population's exposure to chemicals .
biomonitoring , which measures chemicals in people's tissues or body fluids , has shown that the u.s. population is widely exposed to chemicals used in everyday products .
specifically , my statement addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which epa incorporates information from biomonitoring studies into its assessments of chemicals , ( 2 ) steps that epa has taken to improve the usefulness of biomonitoring data , and ( 3 ) the extent to which epa has the authority under tsca to require chemical companies to develop and submit biomonitoring data to epa .
this is a promising development .
for example , the cdc reported that 90 percent of the people tested had detectable levels of bisphenol a ( bpa ) .
on the basis of results from recent studies using novel approaches to test for subtle effects , the food and drug administration announced in january of this year that it and the national toxicology program at the national institutes of health ( nih ) have some concern about the potential effects of bpa on the brain , behavior , and prostate gland in fetuses , infants , and young children .
according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , “biomonitoring measurements are the most health - relevant assessments of exposure because they measure the amount of the chemical that actually gets into people from all environmental sources , such as the air , soil , water , dust , or food combined.” the cdc conducts the most comprehensive biomonitoring program in the country , and in december 2009 it published the fourth in a series of reports on the concentrations of certain chemicals or their by - products in a representative sample of the u.s. population .
my testimony today is based on our prior work on federal biomonitoring efforts and discusses epa's use of current biomonitoring studies , epa's biomonitoring research strategy , and epa's authorities under tsca to obtain biomonitoring data .
