the number of orphan drugs fda has approved for marketing has also increased over time , with 77 marketing approvals in 2017 .
however , the growth in orphan designations and marketing approvals has coincided with questions about fda's orphan drug program , including that drug development challenges remain for the majority of rare diseases .
currently , only about 5 percent of rare diseases have treatments approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
demand for orphan designations has grown substantially since the oda's enactment , with the number of designation applications nearly tripling over the past decade .
according to fda , the growth in orphan designations and marketing approvals is expected to continue , partly due to medical advances that make health care more personalized , genetically targeted , and likely to address rare diseases .
in this report , we examine 1. actions fda has taken to address the growing demand for orphan 2. the extent to which fda has used consistent criteria and complete information to review applications for orphan designation , and the characteristics of drugs seeking orphan designation ; 3. the orphan drugs fda has approved for marketing ; and 4. the steps fda has taken to address challenges in rare disease drug development .
due to the importance of rare disease drug development , you requested that we provide information on drugs receiving orphan designations and marketing approvals , and examine certain aspects of fda's orphan drug processes .
the orphan drug act ( oda ) was enacted in 1983 to provide drug manufacturers with incentives for developing treatments for small patient populations that were not expected to be profitable .
separate from orphan designation , fda also determines which drugs may be marketed in the united states , based on evidence of safety and effectiveness .
in addition , we reviewed its plan for additional programmatic actions to meet designation demand and the mechanisms the agency has in place to respond to orphan drug issues .
these incentives include tax credits and exclusive marketing rights .
to receive orphan designation , a drug manufacturer must provide evidence demonstrating that its drug meets certain criteria specified in the oda and fda's implementing regulations .
we also reviewed the agency's plans for staffing levels and expertise devoted to reviewing orphan designation applications .
to examine the actions fda has taken to address the growing demand for orphan designations , we reviewed agency plans for meeting this demand and reports on timeliness metrics used to track designation reviews .
a rare disease or condition ( hereafter , “disease” ) is typically defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the united states , and these diseases are often serious or life - threatening .
the oda , as amended , provides incentives for drug manufacturers to develop drugs and biologics ( hereafter referred to collectively as “drugs” ) to treat rare diseases .
while fda action to improve its designation reviews will not address the broader rare disease drug development challenges identified by stakeholders we interviewed and research we analyzed , it could help fda ensure the consistency of its review process , particularly as demand for orphan designations continues to grow .
we also assessed fda's orphan designation processes against federal internal control standards .
