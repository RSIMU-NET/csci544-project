this testimony addresses ( 1 ) the specific efforts of u.s. agencies to improve intellectual property protection in other nations , ( 2 ) the means used to coordinate these efforts , and ( 3 ) challenges facing the enforcement efforts abroad .
the u.s. government , through numerous agencies , is seeking better intellectual property protection overseas .
as a result , u.s. goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy in many countries .
to address these issues , we analyzed key u.s. government reports and documents from eight federal agencies and two offices .
the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property through means such as copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
to understand more fully how u.s. agencies have performed in this regard , you asked us to identify and review their activities .
we also conducted field work in four countries where serious problems regarding the protection of intellectual property have been reported ( brazil , china , russia , and ukraine ) and met with u.s. embassy and foreign government officials as well as representatives of u.s. companies and industry groups operating in those countries .
however , protection of intellectual property in many parts of the world is inadequate .
in addition to meeting with federal officials , we met with officials from key intellectual property industry groups and reviewed reports they had prepared .
as agencies continue to pursue ipr improvements overseas , they will face daunting challenges .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on u.s. efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property rights ( ipr ) overseas and our recent report on this topic .
these challenges include the need to create political will overseas , recent technological advancements that facilitate the production and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods , and powerful economic incentives for both producers and consumers , particularly in developing countries .
as you know , the united states dominates the creation and export of intellectual property â€” creations of the mind .
we conducted our work from june 2003 through july 2004 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
the effects of u.s. actions are most evident in strengthened foreign ipr legislation .
with a broad mandate under its authorizing legislation , niplecc has struggled to establish its purpose and unique role .
u.s. efforts are now focused on enforcement , since effective enforcement is often the weak link in intellectual property protection overseas and the situation may be deteriorating for some industries .
further , counterfeiting of products such as pharmaceuticals and food items fuels public health and safety concerns .
eight federal agencies , as well as the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) and the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , undertake the primary u.s. government activities to protect and enforce u.s. intellectual property rights overseas .
further , as the u.s. government focuses increasingly on enforcement , it will face different and complex factors , such as organized crime , that may prove quite difficult to address .
such considerations could help niplecc identify appropriate activities and operate more effectively to coordinate intellectual property law enforcement issues .
the agencies are the departments of commerce , state , justice , and homeland security ; ustr ; the copyright office ; the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) ; and the u.s. international trade commission .
