the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency responsible for administering medicare , has established quality and patient safety requirements called conditions of participation ( cop ) that hospitals must meet in order to be eligible for medicare payment .
according to cms , serious deficiencies substantially limit a hospital's capability to render adequate care and adversely affect the safety and health of patients .
examples of serious deficiencies include a hospital's inability to provide adequate nursing services or failure to implement and enforce infection control policies .
hospitals that are accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( jcaho ) are generally deemed under federal law to be compliant with medicare requirements for patient safety and health and become eligible for payments from medicare .
questions have been raised by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( oig ) and others regarding whether accreditation by jcaho ensures that hospitals provide adequate care .
no other health care accreditation program has this same statutory authority .
federal law establishes criteria for hospitals for purposes of medicare .
in january 2004 , jcaho implemented a new hospital accreditation process with goals that included further enhancing health care quality and safety .
cms oversight of jcaho's hospital accreditation program is limited because it cannot restrict or remove jcaho's accreditation authority if the agency detects problems .
in fiscal year 2002 , nearly 7.4 million medicare beneficiaries received inpatient health care at hospitals that participated in medicare .
specifically , we ( 1 ) examined the extent to which jcaho's pre - 2004 hospital accreditation process identified deficiencies in medicare cops that were identified by state survey agencies , ( 2 ) determined whether jcaho's new hospital accreditation process has potential for improving the detection of deficiencies in medicare cops and whether the process was adequately tested , and ( 3 ) examined the effectiveness of cms's oversight of jcaho's hospital accreditation program .
jcaho sets standards that accredited hospitals must meet and reports that these standards are more comprehensive than the medicare cops .
of the four possible outcomes to this comparison of survey findings — ( 1 ) jcaho and state agencies both identify no deficiencies , ( 2 ) jcaho identifies deficiencies not found by state agencies , ( 3 ) jcaho and state agencies both identify the same deficiencies , and ( 4 ) state agencies identify deficiencies that jcaho does not — we focused on the fourth because it highlights the need for cms oversight of the hospital accreditation program .
specifically , experts have questioned how well jcaho's hospital accreditation process identifies deficiencies in hospitals that could jeopardize patient safety and health .
the validation surveys , which are performed by agencies that cms has agreements with in each state , help cms determine whether medicare quality and safety requirements are being met .
you asked that we examine the effectiveness of jcaho's hospital accreditation process in ensuring that hospitals comply with medicare cops to ensure the safety and health of medicare beneficiaries .
to determine the adequacy of cms's oversight of jcaho's hospital accreditation program , we reviewed relevant statutory and regulatory provisions regarding oversight of health care accreditation programs and how cms had implemented this authority in order to provide oversight .
