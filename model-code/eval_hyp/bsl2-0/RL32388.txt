moreover , these laws influence the effectiveness of federal agencies when they implement , evaluate , and help formulate public policies .
the quality of the general management laws , as well as their implementation , are considered crucial to maintaining the accountability of the executive branch to congress , the president , and the public .
in combination , these reports have three main objectives: to identify and describe the major general management laws under which the executive branch is required to operate , including their rationale , design , and scope ; to assist members of congress and their staff in overseeing management of the executive branch ; and to help congress when considering potential changes to the management laws , as well as other legislation , including authorizing statutes and appropriations .
the compendium contains profiles of selected "general management laws" â€” broad statutes designed to regulate the activities , procedures , and administration of all or most executive branch agencies .
as a complement to the compendium , this report ( "companion report" ) focuses on major themes and possible management policy options for congress that emerge when the general management laws are viewed together , as a whole .
this report , general management laws: major themes and management policy options , is a companion to crs report rl30795 , general management laws: a compendium ( pdf ) ( hereafter "compendium" ) .
the companion report reflects the status of general management laws at the end of the first session of the 108 th congress , and will be updated along with the compendium to reflect actions taken through the close of the 108 th congress .
with regard to general management laws , congress faced this tension between flexibility and accountability in 2002 and 2003 , when considering whether to grant the departments of homeland security ( dhs ) and defense ( dod ) discretion to determine some of the contents of their human resources management ( hrm ) systems through regulation .
each of these themes , in turn , may raise potential issues and "management policy" options for congress .
institutional checks: when authority is delegated to an agency , congress can ensure that one or more additional agencies or entities can veto or block the delegate agency's actions .
for example , congress could involve another agency in the promulgation of regulations ( such as the dhs personnel system , which requires that regulations be prescribed jointly by dhs and the office of personnel management ( opm ) ) ; require notice and comment before an agency is allowed to proceed with certain actions ; provide sequential funding within an appropriation that is contingent upon certain conditions at each of several milestones ; require the agency or additional agencies to conduct an independent study examining an issue ; or use "committee vetoes" to prevent certain actions absent congressional committee approval .
the entries are organized into the following seven functional categories: information and regulatory management ; strategic planning , performance measurement , and program evaluation ; financial management , budget , and accounting ; organization ; procurement and real property management ; intergovernmental relations management ; and human resources management and ethics .
