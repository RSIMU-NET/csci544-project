mandatory spending accounts for more than half of the federal government's annual outlays .
discretionary spending , by contrast , is provided in annual appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees .
congress typically vests authority to implement these laws in agencies .
in issuing the omb memorandum , the bush administration's stated goal was to restrain federal spending growth for mandatory spending programs .
the memorandum did not address , however , whether agencies' administrative actions and corresponding spending changes would be consistent with congressional intent or expectations , or whether agencies' proposals and omb's decisions would be transparent to congress and the public .
for purposes of omb's process , an increase was defined as spending more than the amount that the administration assumed in its most recent projection of what is required under current law to fund the mandatory spending program .
 ( see appendix b for tabular displays of fy2009 mandatory outlays broken out by authorizing committee and programmatic area. ) .
for the most part , mandatory spending programs are provided for in substantive laws under the jurisdiction of house and senate authorizing committees .
to offset such a difference in spending , the memorandum also required the agency to propose actions that would "comparably reduce" mandatory spending .
after several years of implementation , however , very little is publicly known about the scope and effect of omb's process or the rationales for omb determinations .
in one case , some details about omb's process were disclosed publicly in june 2010 , which prompted congressional concerns about agency policy implementation and the role of omb .
in 2009 , the barack obama administration said it would continue the omb memorandum's process .
finally , appendix c of the report discusses how congress in other contexts has responded legislatively to the prospect of ( 1 ) agencies operating under broad grants of discretion to implement laws , and ( 2 ) the president's involvement in agency decision making through omb .
in using the term "paygo," the administration juxtaposed this omb involvement in agency decision making with a different , statutory mechanism that congress has used when carrying out its power of the purse and legislative function ( see box 1 ) .
the administration elsewhere characterized the process as "augmenting its ... controls" on agency decisions , and , in addition , referred to the process as "administrative paygo. .
next , the report discusses potential options for congress .
if an agency wished to use discretion under current law in a way that would "increase mandatory spending," the memorandum required the agency to propose the action to omb .
it then discusses other potential implications , if the omb process were widely utilized in practice .
joshua b. bolten , director of omb at that time , wrote that "effective immediately," omb would involve itself systematically in some aspects of how agencies execute laws related to mandatory spending .
this report's analysis draws on these precedents , which may inform congressional consideration of options related to the omb memorandum and its use on behalf of the president .
