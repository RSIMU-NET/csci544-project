in fiscal year 2017 , dhs announced the availability of 10 preparedness grant programs totaling more than $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2017 .
following the federal response to hurricane katrina in 2005 , congress enacted the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) .
in response to the act , among other things , dhs centralized its preparedness grants under fema's grant programs directorate ( gpd ) to better integrate and coordinate grant management .
as described in more detail below , our recommendations have identified additional steps fema can take to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these efforts , including enhancing coordination and providing guidance on preparedness .
the act also requires that fema develop a national preparedness system and assess preparedness capabilities to determine the nation's preparedness .
gpd provides preparedness grants to state , local , tribal , and territorial governments , as well as transportation authorities , nonprofit organizations , and the private sector , to improve the nation's readiness in preventing , protecting against , responding to , recovering from and mitigating terrorist attacks , major disasters and other emergencies .
our work over the last seven years has focused on fema's efforts to coordinate federal interagency preparedness and manage and assess the impact of fema's preparedness grants on state and local preparedness .
fema has taken actions to address some of these recommendations , but more fully addressing all of them could lead to additional savings , better services to the public , improved program performance and accountability , and , ultimately , a better prepared nation .
according to dhs , from fiscal years 2002 through 2017 the department has awarded over $49 billion to a variety of dhs preparedness grant programs to enhance the capabilities of state , local , tribal , and territorial grant recipients to carry out the above activities related to terrorist attacks and other disasters .
this statement specifically addresses fema's efforts to manage preparedness grants and our prior recommendations .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to provide an update on the efforts of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) — a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — to manage preparedness grants and measure and assess national preparedness capabilities .
for example , the national preparedness report noted that while many programs exist to build and sustain preparedness capabilities , challenges remain in measuring their progress over time .
fema has taken some steps to address our recommendation .
we reported in march 2013 that fema has made some progress in assessing its preparedness capabilities , but continued to face challenges developing a national preparedness system that could assist fema in prioritizing preparedness grant funding .
my testimony today covers our prior work on fema preparedness efforts from march 2011 through february 2016 and selected updates conducted in december 2017 and february 2018 .
regardless , as of february 2018 , fema had taken steps to assess preparedness capabilities , but had not yet completed a national preparedness assessment with clear , objective , and quantifiable capability requirements against which to assess preparedness , as we recommended .
according to fema , the new methodology will measure changes in state and urban area preparedness through the use of standardized capability targets and key indicators that will show how fema preparedness grants are being used to address gaps in capability targets .
