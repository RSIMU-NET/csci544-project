fcc has also initiated efforts to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to ensure universal access to affordable , high quality broadband services .
this report focuses on the low - income program and our objectives were to review ( 1 ) how program participation and support payments have changed in the last 5 calendar years ( 2005-2009 ) and what factors may have affected program participation , ( 2 ) the extent to which fcc uses performance goals and measures to manage the program , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the program has mechanisms in place to evaluate program risks and monitor controls over compliance with program rules .
to begin addressing these and other concerns , fcc has taken preliminary steps , such as initiating a universal service working group , to assist in fcc's efforts to modernize and reform all universal service programs .
we have previously reported on oversight and internal control mechanisms used by fcc to oversee other usf programs .
given the importance of the usf to the nation's telecommunications policy , significant advances in telecommunications technology , and potential usf reform efforts , you asked us to review issues surrounding all the usf programs .
however , telecommunications technology has advanced and new ways to access telecommunications services have been developed .
for example , in our reviews of the usf e - rate program , we found weaknesses in the administration and operational framework and have recommended corrective actions to reduce fraud , waste , and abuse in the program .
in particular , in 2009 , fcc was mandated to develop a broadband plan that would “ensure that all people of the united states have access to broadband capability…” an fcc task force issued the plan in march 2010 , with recommendations , among many other things , on how to reform the usf and modify the low - income program to support broadband service .
to expand the availability of lifeline , which discounts local service , and to provide additional consumer choice , fcc has allowed certain prepaid wireless providers , to be granted limited designation as eligible telecommunications carriers ( etc ) for the low - income program in their licensed service areas .
as new technologies continue to develop , the universal service policy will be challenged to define “access” to telecommunications services for low - income consumers .
in 2009 , the low - income program provided approximately $1 billion in support payments .
traditionally , universal service policy and access to telecommunications services for low - income subscribers has centered on landline residential telephone service throughout the united states .
for example , consumers today have more options to access telephone service than in the past , including cable , wireless , and broadband .
to respond to these objectives , we reviewed key orders , reports , and program assessments from fcc and the universal service administrative company ( usac ) , the not - for - profit corporation that administers the low - income program under a memorandum of understanding with fcc , and interviewed officials from both organizations and other stakeholders with knowledge of the program .
we compared this information against our guidance on useful practices for developing successful goals and measures and our standards for internal controls in the federal government , as well as office of management and budget ( omb ) guidance on internal controls .
