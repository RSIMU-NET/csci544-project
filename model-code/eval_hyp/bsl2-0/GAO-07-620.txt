for example , in 2003 , the secretary of defense expanded socom's duties to include leading the department of defense's ( dod ) global war on terrorism ( gwot ) operations .
in the past several years , socom's acquisition program budget has increased significantly — from $788 million in 2001 to approximately $1.91 billion in 2006 — as the role of the special operations forces in u.s. military operations has grown .
in light of socom's expanded acquisition duties , congress requested that gao review socom's management of its acquisition programs .
both the asds and cv - 22 programs have experienced significant cost , schedule , and performance problems because of requirements , technology , and design issues .
the change became more prominent with the fiscal year 2004 budget request , in which the president proposed a 47 percent increase in socom's funding .
to what extent have socom's acquisition programs progressed as planned , meeting their initial cost and schedule estimates ? .
what challenges if any does socom face in managing its acquisition programs ? .
socom has encountered difficulties over the past several years with two of its flagship acquisition programs — the advanced seal delivery system ( asds ) and the cv - 22 advanced vertical lift aircraft .
in keeping with this expanded role , dod has begun to re - tool socom from primarily a supporting command into a command responsible for planning and executing missions in gwot .
socom funds sof - peculiar modifications to the cv - 22 .
to do so we addressed the following questions: what types of acquisition programs has socom undertaken since 2001 and are they consistent with socom's mission ? .
this “special operations forces - peculiar” equipment may be newly created or standard equipment modified to meet sof needs , but may not duplicate equipment provided from the other military services .
to assess socom's management of its acquisition programs , we collected and reviewed information on all programs undertaken by the command between 2001 and 2006 .
the asds program is funded by socom and managed by the navy .
since both programs began before 2001 , we did not include them in our analysis .
the special operations command ( socom ) was established in 1987 to oversee the training , doctrine , and equipping of all u.s. special operations forces ( sof ) .
these larger programs involve modifications to existing platform systems and more substantial technology development efforts .
to identify the challenges they face , we examined and analyzed pertinent documentation to include dod , military departments , and socom directives , instructions , policies , and operating procedures related to the defense acquisition system , and we interviewed key officials from socom's special operations acquisition and logistics and resources and requirements organizations .
the basic cv - 22 platform is funded by the air force and produced under a navy contract .
however , we have reported separately on the programs , and those reports are listed at the end of this report .
we analyzed the information to determine what types of systems were being acquired and whether programs were meeting planned cost , schedule , and quantity objectives .
