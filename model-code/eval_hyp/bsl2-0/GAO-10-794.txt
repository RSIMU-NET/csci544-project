furthermore , our prior work has noted that critical steps and practices that help agencies to achieve success include ( 1 ) strategic planning ; ( 2 ) measuring performance ; ( 3 ) aligning resources to support goals ; ( 4 ) involving stakeholders ; and ( 5 ) building expertise .
because some of africom's activities represent a shift from traditional warfighting activities , africom's efforts to plan and implement its activities have required increased collaboration with other federal partners such as the department of state ( state ) and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .
according to africom's mission statement , its activities will focus on conducting sustained security engagement and collaborating with other u.s. government and international partners to promote a stable and secure african environment in support of u.s. foreign policy .
these activities ranged from efforts to fight hiv / aids in african militaries to assisting african partners in combating terrorism .
however , as the command has matured , africom — with its four military service components ( army africa , naval forces africa , marine corps africa , air force africa ) , special operations command , and horn of africa task force — has begun planning and prioritizing activities .
africom's initial approach was to continue to conduct these inherited activities with little change .
this report is part of a series of studies on dod's efforts in africa since the establishment of africom , which have been requested by the subcommittee on national security and foreign affairs of the house committee on oversight and government reform .
we also reviewed non - dod documents to determine how africom's strategies compared or aligned with the strategies of other federal partners , including the fiscal years 2007 – 2012 department of state / usaid joint strategic plan ; the usaid strategic framework for africa ; and fiscal year 2008 , fiscal year 2009 , and fiscal year 2010 mission strategic plans of 12 u.s. embassies in africa .
we made recommendations to help africom address the challenges it faced with respect to communicating its mission , integrating personnel from other federal agencies ( “interagency personnel” ) into the command , and determining the total costs for establishing a permanent headquarters and offices in africa .
africom has created overarching strategic guidance and has led activity planning meetings with its stakeholders such as state .
concerns included areas such as humanitarian assistance and other noncombat activities that involve non - dod agencies and organizations .
to conduct our work , we reviewed a wide range of dod and command documentation , including dod strategies and guidance ; africom's theater strategy , theater campaign plan , and posture statements ; and africom components' priorities and draft strategic plans , when available .
furthermore , we have previously reported and testified on challenges that africom has faced since its establishment with regard to its presence on the continent .
however , activities are being implemented as the detailed supporting plans for conducting many activities have not yet been finalized .
the department of defense ( dod ) created its newest combatant command , u.s. africa command ( africom ) , to provide a more strategic , holistic approach to u.s. military activities in africa .
