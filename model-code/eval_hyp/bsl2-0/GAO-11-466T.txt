addressing these fiscal challenges will require action on several fronts .
first , all federal programs and activities — discretionary programs , mandatory spending , revenues , and tax expenditures — need to be reexamined .
this , in turn , will limit budget flexibility and the federal government's ability to respond to future challenges .
absent changes in fiscal policy , the structural imbalance between spending and revenue paths lead to large and growing deficits .
the accumulation of large deficits leads to an unsustainable increase in debt over the long term .
looking forward , our long - term simulations underscore the need to begin addressing the long - term federal fiscal outlook .
in addition , weaknesses in management capacity , both governmentwide and in individual agencies , undermine efficient and effective government .
moving forward , the gpra modernization act can offer opportunities to help make tough choices in setting priorities as well as reforming programs and management practices to better link resources to results .
here too , our recent update to our high - risk list identified numerous opportunities to reduce costs and improve government performance .
the federal government is the world's largest and most complex entity , with about $3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2010 that fund a broad array of programs and operations .
in this regard , we recently issued a report that identified over 80 areas of potential duplication , overlap , or fragmentation as well as cost savings and revenue - enhancing opportunities .
second , program structures that are outmoded , overlapping , duplicative , fragmented , and not up to the challenges of the times must be reformed or restructured .
in particular , the act calls for: a more coordinated and crosscutting approach to achieving meaningful efforts to address weaknesses in major management functions , ensuring performance information is both useful and used in decision sustained leadership commitment and accountability for achieving results , engaging congress in identifying management and performance issues to address .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss how the provisions put into place by the government performance and results act ( gpra ) modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) , could help address significant fiscal , performance , and management challenges facing the federal government .
my statement today , which is based on our past and ongoing work , will focus on five key areas where the requirements of gprama could help address government challenges .
finally , my statement will speak to gao's role in evaluating implementation of this act .
if programs are overlapping , fragmented , or duplicative , they must be streamlined .
gprama provides the administration and congress with new tools to identify strategies that are achieving results as well as those that are ineffective , duplicative , or wasteful that could be eliminated .
realizing the promise of gprama for improving government performance and accountability and reducing waste will require sustained oversight of implementation .
programs and management functions at significant risk of waste , fraud , and abuse must be corrected .
although agencies have made progress improving their operations in recent years , they need more effective management capabilities to better implement new programs and policies .
