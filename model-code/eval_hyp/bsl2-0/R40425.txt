projections of future medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries .
in response to these concerns , congress may consider a range of medicare reform options , from making changes within the current structure , including modifying provider payments and revising existing oversight and regulatory mechanisms , to restructuring the entire program .
cbo also estimates that federal medicare spending ( after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts ) will be about $637 billion in 2019 , accounting for about 14% of total federal spending and 3% of gdp .
the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that total medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion ; of this amount , approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits .
the committees of jurisdiction for the mandatory spending ( benefits ) portion of medicare are the senate committee on finance , the house committee on ways and means , and the house committee on energy and commerce .
the house and senate committees on appropriations have jurisdiction over the discretionary spending used to administer and oversee the program .
the program has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders as well as on the economy in general through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled , the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by those beneficiaries , its payments to providers who supply those health care services , and its interaction with other insurance coverage .
spending under the program ( except for a portion of administrative costs ) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process .
about 28% of medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services ( see figure 1 ) .
medicare is expected to be a high - priority issue in the current congress .
in 2019 , the program will cover an estimated 61 million persons ( 52 million aged and 9 million disabled ) .
the program is administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons , so long as specific criteria are met .
