in march 2015 , hhs announced plans to make addressing opioid abuse a high priority through two broad goals: ( 1 ) decreasing opioid overdoses and overall overdose deaths , and ( 2 ) decreasing the prevalence of opioid use disorder .
further , in january 2017 , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the hhs agency that administers medicare , issued its opioid misuse strategy for the medicaid and medicare programs , including medicare part d. the strategy includes the agency's plans to address concerns about beneficiary use of opioids and the prescribing of opioids by providers .
accordingly , this testimony focuses on ( 1 ) how cms oversees beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under medicare part d , and ( 2 ) how cms oversees providers who prescribe opioids to medicare part d beneficiaries .
in addition , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( hhs - oig ) reported that 14.4 million people ( about one - third ) who participate in medicare part d received at least one prescription for opioids in 2016 , and that part d spending for opioids in 2016 was almost $4.1 billion .
misuse of prescription opioids , which are used to treat both acute and chronic pain , has become a serious public health problem for the u.s. population , including medicare beneficiaries .
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) reported that from 1999 to 2013 the rate of drug poisoning deaths from prescription opioids nearly quadrupled from 1.4 to 5.1 per 100,000 people .
gao and the hhs - oig have previously reported on inappropriate activities that can be associated with such prescriptions , including “doctor shopping” to receive multiple opioid prescriptions from different providers ; the diversion of prescription drugs for uses other than what was intended ; and questionable prescribing practices by providers , including those in medicare .
for our report , we reviewed cms opioid utilization and prescriber data , cms guidance for plan sponsors , and cms's strategy to prevent opioid misuse .
in 2016 , cdc issued guidelines with recommendations for prescribing opioids in outpatient settings for chronic pain .
cdc guidelines also noted that providers should use additional caution in prescribing opioids to patients aged 65 and older , because the drugs can accumulate in the body to toxic levels .
the guidelines recommended that providers use caution when prescribing opioids at any dose , carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when increasing opioid dosage to 50 mg morphine - equivalent dose ( med ) per day or more , and either avoid or carefully justify dosage at 90 mg med or more .
my remarks today discuss the findings and recommendations from our report on cms efforts to oversee prescription opioids .
we also interviewed officials from cms , the six largest part d plan sponsors — private organizations , such as health insurance companies , contracted by cms to provide outpatient drug benefit plans to medicare beneficiaries — and 12 national associations selected to represent insurance plans , pharmacy benefit managers , physicians , patients , and regulatory and law enforcement agencies .
i am pleased to be here to discuss our recently released report on oversight of opioid prescribing in the medicare program .
