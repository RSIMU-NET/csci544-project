cra defines a “major” rule as one which has resulted in or is likely to result in ( 1 ) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more ; ( 2 ) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers , individual industries , government agencies , or geographic regions ; or ( 3 ) significant adverse effects on competition , employment , investment , productivity , innovation , or on the ability of u.s. - based enterprises to compete with foreign - based enterprises in domestic and export markets .
however , there remain areas of concern .
under cra two types of rules , major and nonmajor , must be submitted to both houses of congress and the gao before either can take effect .
these include preparation of a cost - benefit analysis , when required , and compliance with the regulatory flexibility act , the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 , the administrative procedure act , the paperwork reduction act , and executive order no .
in addition , executive branch and independent agencies appear to be more cognizant of their responsibilities under the requirements of the cra .
gao's primary role under cra is to provide the congress with a report on each major rule concerning gao's assessment of the promulgating federal agency's “compliance with the procedural steps” required by various acts and executive orders governing the regulatory process .
cra specifies that the determination of what rules are major is to be made by oira .
since i testified before this subcommittee on march 10 , 1998 , in some areas we have seen enhanced cooperation from oira in implementing the cra .
after a brief review of the operation of the statute , i will discuss what progress has been made in four areas during the past 3 months .
major rules cannot be effective until 60 days after publication in the federal register or submission to congress and gao , whichever is later .
nonmajor rules become effective when specified by the agency , but not before they are filed with the congress and gao .
i am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the general accounting office's experience in fulfilling its responsibilities under the congressional review act ( cra ) and our efforts to coordinate implementation of the act with the office of management and budget's office of information and regulatory affairs ( oira ) .
since the congressional rulemaking review provisions of cra were enacted on march 29 , 1996 , our office has received 131 major and 9,052 nonmajor rules from executive branch and independent agencies .
we have made this database available , with limited research capabilities , on the internet .
our database captures the title , the agency , the regulation identification number , the type of rule , the proposed effective date , the date published in the federal register , the congressional review trigger date , and any joint resolutions of disapproval that may be enacted .
gao's report must be sent to the congressional committees of jurisdiction within 15 calendar days .
i will discuss shortly our belief that this database would have more significant value to the congress if the executive branch agencies would cooperate with gao and provide additional information relevant to each rule .
