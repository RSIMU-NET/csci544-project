as demand for traditional postal services has declined , usps has struggled to operate as a self - financing entity and has experienced significant losses â€” $78 billion from fiscal years 2007 through 2019 .
the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) generally prohibits usps from providing new types of nonpostal products and services .
this report examines: the costs , revenues , and non - revenue benefits associated with usps's retail facilities ; the nonpostal efforts usps has conducted since 2008 to increase revenues and non - revenue benefits from its retail facilities , and the costs , revenues , non - revenue benefits , and challenges associated with such efforts ; and the key considerations for additional nonpostal efforts usps could pursue to increase revenues and non - revenue benefits from its retail facilities .
as a result , usps's financial viability has been on our list of high - risk areas since 2009 .
given the ubiquity of usps's retail facilities and the costs to maintain them , postal stakeholders , such as the task force on the united states postal system , have suggested that usps could be authorized to offer additional products and services through its retail facilities in order to generate revenue and provide benefits to consumers , other government entities , and communities .
we used these analyses to identify the sources and amounts of retail facility costs ( e.g. , personnel ) and revenues ( e.g. , stamp sales ) for most retail facilities and facilities where revenues may not cover costs .
however , this mission continues to be at risk because usps's revenues do not cover its expenses .
to identify non - revenue benefits of usps's retail facility network , we reviewed publications and studies , such as those conducted by usps , usps's office of inspector general ( oig ) , and usps's oversight body , the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) .
you asked us to review the value of usps's retail facility network and the opportunities to increase the value of this network through nonpostal efforts ( i.e. , efforts that are not directly related to mail delivery ) .
even if usps were authorized to offer these services , there is little consensus as to what sorts of opportunities may be worth pursuing .
to describe the costs , revenues , and non - revenue benefits associated with usps's retail facilities , we reviewed usps's financial analysis of its retail network for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 , the only years usps conducted such analysis .
for this comparison , we made certain adjustments to usps's total operating expenses as stated in its reports on form 10-k by excluding certain components of workers' compensation and retirement benefits expenses that did not relate to active employees' costs , because those costs are related to service performed in the past and thus do not reflect the impact of operational changes .
this network is central to usps's fulfilling its mission to provide prompt , reliable , and efficient postal services .
we then compared these amounts with usps's total costs and revenues to determine how much retail facilities contribute to them .
