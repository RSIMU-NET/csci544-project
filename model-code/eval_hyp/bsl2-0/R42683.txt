the purpose of the report is to aid congress in its oversight of critical infrastructure programs and activities at dhs .
the u.s. patriot act ( p.l .
1016 ( e ) ) defined critical infrastructure as: systems and assets , whether physical or virtual , so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security , national economic security , national public health or safety , or any combination of those matters .
to the extent that resilience can contribute to reducing that risk , congressional interest extends to the policies and programs associated with promoting resilience .
it also identifies and discusses issues related to the evolution of policy and programs at the department of homeland security ( dhs ) that are meant to , or could , promote the resiliency of the nation's critical infrastructure .
reducing the potential risks associated with the loss of critical infrastructure resulting from a terrorist , natural hazard , or technological disaster ( hereinafter referred to collectively as all - hazard events ) is a key element in the nation's homeland security strategy and a topic of continued interest in congress .
dhs has identified 18 sectors of the economy that they believe possess such systems and assets .
dhs's 2009 national infrastructure protection plan defined resilience as "the ability to resist , absorb , recover from , or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions. .
among these are electric power generation and distribution , drinking water , communications and information systems , oil and gas production and distribution , transportation systems , and banking and finance .
this report focuses on the resilience of critical infrastructure .
the resilience of a community , a region , or the nation as a whole is also important to homeland security , and depends in part on the resilience of critical infrastructure , but also involves a broader range of elements , behaviors , and social - economic relationships that are beyond the scope of this report .
in a homeland security context , a change of conditions implies a terrorist attack , a natural hazard , such as hurricane or earthquake , or a technological failure , such as a dam collapse or a serious accident at a nuclear power plant .
this report discusses the concept of resilience in the context of critical infrastructure and homeland security .
107-56 , sec .
to date , congress has taken primarily an oversight role in regard to critical infrastructure resilience , holding hearings and requesting reports from its congressional support agencies .
if additional incentives are warranted , congress could consider expanding its preparedness and mitigation grant programs to include more private sector owner and operators of critical infrastructure .
however , it has been two years since gao reported that dhs had not yet developed the ability to measure the extent to which owners and operators of critical infrastructure assets had taken resilience - enhancing actions .
congress may choose to continue its oversight of the progress being made in the area of metrics .
congress also may revisit the ps - prep program .
updating the latest metrics on the extent to which firms are adopting resiliency measures or the extent to which firms are seeking certification through the voluntary ps - prep program could provide insight into the need , if any , for additional incentives beyond those provided by the market .
