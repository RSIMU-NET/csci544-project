as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .
however , this report focuses singularly on aggregate national net farm income and the status of the farm debt - to - asset ratio as reported by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda's ) economic research service ( ers ) .
the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .
it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .
in addition , u.s. agricultural output inc ludes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .
the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .
usda projects u.s. agricultural exports at $139.8 billion in 2017 , up 8% from 2016's total ( figure 18 ) , due largely to an improving economic outlook in several major foreign importing countries .
usda also projects that u.s. agricultural imports will be higher , at $116.2 billion ( +3% ) , with a resulting agricultural trade surplus of $23.6 billion ( +42% ) .
annual u.s. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period .
when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .
u.s. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income , especially since 2005 .
as a result , the sharp downturn in those exports that followed 2014's peak of $152.3 billion both coincided with and deepened the downturn in farm income that started in 2015 .
meanwhile , total farm debt is forecast to rise to $390 billion in 2017 ( +4.4% ) .
in inflation - adjusted terms ( using 2009 dollars ) , farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( figure 22 ) .
the u.s. farm income and asset - value situation and outlook suggest a relatively stable financial position heading into 2017 for the agriculture sector as a whole but with considerable uncertainty regarding the downward outlook for prices and market conditions for the sector and an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses: farm asset values — which reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investments — are projected to be up 4% in 2017 to a nominal $3,075 billion ( table 3 ) .
the leveling off of crop land values in 2017 reflects mixed forecasts for commodity prices ( corn , soybeans , and cotton lower ; wheat , rice , and livestock products higher ) and the uncertainty associated with international commodity markets ( figure 23 ) .
