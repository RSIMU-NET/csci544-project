efforts to enforce these sanctions are referred to as worksite enforcement and are conducted by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) .
yet , the commission also noted that immigration , particularly illegal immigration , can have adverse consequences by helping to depress wages for low - skilled workers and creating net fiscal costs for state and local governments .
following the passage of irca , the u.s. commission on immigration reform and various immigration experts have concluded that deterring illegal immigration requires , among other things , strategies that focus on disrupting the ability of illegal immigrants to gain employment through a more reliable employment eligibility verification process and a more robust worksite enforcement capacity .
as the u.s. commission on immigration reform reported , immigration contributes to the u.s. national economy by providing workers for certain labor - intensive industries and contributing to the economic revitalization of some communities .
the legislative proposals currently under consideration would revise the current employment verification process and the employer sanctions program .
specifically , i will discuss our observations on ( 1 ) the current employment verification process and ( 2 ) ice's priorities and resources for the worksite enforcement program and the challenges it has faced in implementing that program .
in the nearly 20 years since passage of irca , the employment eligibility verification process and worksite enforcement program have remained largely unchanged .
citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) , and social security administration ( ssa ) officials in headquarters and selected field locations .
the act established a two - pronged approach for helping to limit the employment of unauthorized workers: ( 1 ) an employment verification process through which employers verify all newly hired employees' work eligibility and ( 2 ) a sanctions program for fining employers who do not comply with the act .
to help address this magnet , in 1986 congress passed the immigration reform and control act ( irca ) , which made it illegal for individuals and entities to knowingly hire , continue to employ , or recruit or refer for a fee unauthorized workers .
in particular , the commission report and other studies have found that the single most important step that could be taken to reduce unlawful migration is the development of a more effective system for verifying work authorization .
moreover , in previous work , we reported that employers of unauthorized aliens faced little likelihood that the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) would investigate , fine , or criminally prosecute them , a circumstance that provides little disincentive for employers who want to circumvent the law .
my testimony today is based on our august 2005 report to congress on the employment verification process and ice's worksite enforcement program .
to address these objectives , we reviewed federal laws and information obtained from ice , u.s .
ice's focus of its enforcement resources on critical infrastructure protection since september 11 , 2001 , is consistent with the dhs mission to combat terrorism by detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure sites which , if exploited , could pose serious threats to domestic security .
this focus on critical infrastructure protection , though , generally has not addressed noncritical infrastructure employers' noncompliance with irca .
