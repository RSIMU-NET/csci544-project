the federal government has an interest in increasing opportunities for minority - and women - owned businesses and helping address barriers they face .
in july 2015 , members of congress hosted a summit with representatives of several federal retirement plans and an insurance program to discuss barriers and other constraints to engaging mwo asset managers .
the agency has also identified challenges faced by minority - owned businesses and taken steps to help address them .
more recently , the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes a provision requiring certain agencies to develop procedures to ensure the fair inclusion of women and minorities in contracting , among other things .
for example , the federal government has established a number of programs that assist small businesses , including those that are minority - and women - owned , when they seek to contract with federal agencies .

asset management firms registered in the united states managed more than $70 trillion as of may 2017 , but asset management firms owned by minorities or women ( mwo asset managers or firms ) manage less than 1 percent of these assets .

despite this small percentage , some industry reports indicate that an increasing number of state , local , and private pension plans and other institutional investors have started using mwo asset managers .
policymakers have continued to raise questions about the transparency of the asset manager selection processes the federal entities used and the lack of diversity in federal asset management overall .
specifically , the 100 largest asset managers account for more than 50 percent of total reported assets .
