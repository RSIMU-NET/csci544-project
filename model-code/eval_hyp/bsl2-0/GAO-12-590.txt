in december 2002 , epa finalized revisions to nsr regulations , including exemptions for certain pollution control projects from nsr .
these revisions were intended to maximize operating flexibility , improve environmental quality , and promote administrative efficiency , among other aims .
the united states depends on a variety of fuels to generate electricity , including fossil fuels ( coal , natural gas , and oil ) , renewable sources ( such as wind , solar , and biomass ) , and nuclear power .
throughout its history , nsr has been characterized by complexity and controversy , involving disputes between epa and industry about , among other issues , whether certain changes to generating units qualified for exclusion as routine maintenance , repair , and replacement .
state implementation plans also must include nsr regulations that are at least as stringent as epa's nsr regulations , although states and local agencies are authorized to include more stringent or additional requirements .
these nsr reforms , as the two rulemakings were known , provoked considerable controversy .
however , epa's regulatory definition of major modification excludes certain activities ; generating units can undertake these activities without obtaining nsr permits or installing any additional controls .
emissions controls can also be expensive ; for example , installing scr equipment in a typical coal - fired generating unit could cost from $108 million to $129 million .
in addition , 564 units ( 38 percent of older units ) did not have any controls for nitrogen oxides , and 1,277 units ( 86 percent of older units ) had not installed selective catalytic reduction ( scr ) equipment , the type of control most effective at reducing nitrogen oxides .
the reduction in emissions from the use of emissions controls can be substantial: scr equipment , for example , can reduce nitrogen oxides emissions by 70 to 95 percent .
without such information , epa cannot fully assess the extent to which state and local agencies incorporate its comments in nsr permits or the extent to which emissions control requirements imposed by state and local permitting agencies reflect suggestions made by epa in its comments .
yet in addition to providing about 70 percent of u.s. electricity , electricity generating units at fossil fuel power plants produce substantial amounts of harmful air emissions .
a substantial number of these older units did not have emissions controls ; for example , 1,201 units ( 74 percent of older units ) did not have controls for sulfur dioxide .
specifically , our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) what information epa maintains on nsr permits issued to fossil fuel electricity generating units ; ( 2 ) challenges , if any , that epa , state , and local agencies face in ensuring compliance with requirements to obtain nsr permits ; and ( 3 ) what available data show about compliance with requirements to obtain nsr permits .
nonetheless , epa has an opportunity to improve its efforts by collecting more comprehensive nsr permitting data .
residential consumers rely on electricity to power their households , and electricity is a key input for businesses that produce trillions of dollars in products and services .
in turn , epa's regional offices carry out much of epa's nsr enforcement responsibilities , oversee states' enforcement programs , and implement nsr in certain areas , such as indian country.1999 , epa has made enforcing nsr among coal - fired electricity generating units a national enforcement priority and has reached several settlements with owners of such units , which have resulted in the installation of emissions controls , unit retirements , agreements to fund environmentally beneficial projects , and tens of millions of dollars in civil penalties .
