as agreed , using the selected key outcomes for nasa as a framework , we ( 1 ) assessed nasa's planned progress toward achieving these outcomes , and the strategies the agency has in place to achieve them ; and ( 2 ) compared nasa's fiscal year 2002 performance plan with the agency's prior year performance plan for these outcomes .
the selected key outcomes are to expand scientific knowledge of the earth system , expand the commercial development of space , and deploy and operate the international space station ( iss ) safely and cost effectively .
additionally , we agreed to analyze how nasa addressed its major management challenges , including the governmentwide high - risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security , that we and nasa's office of inspector general ( oig ) identified .
these are the same outcomes we addressed in our june 2000 review of nasa's fiscal year 1999 performance report and fiscal year 2001 performance plan to provide a baseline by which to measure the agency's performance from year to year.we also addressed these outcomes in our july 2001 review of nasa's fiscal year 2000 performance report .
as you requested , we reviewed the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) fiscal year 2002 performance plan required by the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) to assess the agency's planned performance for the selected key outcomes that you identified as important mission areas for the agency .
as agreed with your office , we are issuing this separate report on our assessment of the selected outcomes in nasa's fiscal year 2002 performance plan .
appendix i provides detailed information on how nasa addressed these challenges .
appendix ii contains nasa's comments on a draft of our report .
new and valuable information on the plans , goals , and strategies of federal agencies has been provided since federal agencies began implementing gpra .
under gpra , annual performance plans are to clearly inform the congress and the public of ( 1 ) the annual performance goals for agencies' major programs and activities , ( 2 ) the measures that will be used to gauge performance , ( 3 ) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals , and ( 4 ) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information .
gpra is intended to shift the focus of government decisionmaking , management , and accountability from activities and processes to the results and outcomes achieved by federal programs .
nasa officials told us that , generally , the changes were made to ( 1 ) improve nasa's ability to assess progress toward achieving goals and objectives ; ( 2 ) reflect commitment to safety and privatization efforts ; or ( 3 ) reflect the broader scope of programs and activities and shifts in enterprise responsibilities .
this section discusses our analysis of nasa's performance goals and measures and strategies the agency has in place , particularly strategic human capital management and information technology , for accomplishing the outcomes .
the issuance of the agencies' performance reports , due by march 31 of each year , represents a new and potentially more substantive phase in the implementation of gpra â€” the opportunity to assess federal agencies' actual performance for the prior fiscal year and to consider what steps are needed to improve performance , and reduce costs in the future .
