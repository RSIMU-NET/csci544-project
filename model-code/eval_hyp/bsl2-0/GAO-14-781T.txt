the legislation that established ntis requires it to be financially self - sustaining to the fullest extent feasible .
to prepare this statement , we relied on our previously published work on ntis ; related updates on actions needed to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in the federal government ; and a review of legislation pertaining to ntis's role .
this information largely takes the form of research reports acquired from federal agencies and their contractors and grantees , as well as from other domestic and foreign sources .
in addition , ntis performs various fee - based information services for other federal agencies .
however , the increasing availability of the information that ntis collects and disseminates — primarily through the web — has called the service's basic statutory function into question .
at your request , my testimony today will summarize the results of a report that we issued in november 2012 on ntis's operations , trends in the age of and demand for the information it collects , and the extent to which this information is readily available from other public sources .
all of the work supporting this testimony was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the performance audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
as you know , ntis was established to serve as a permanent repository and disseminator of scientific , technical , engineering , and business - related information .
thank you for inviting me to testify at today's hearing on the department of commerce's national technical information service ( ntis ) .
we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
we have also continued to highlight this issue in our report and related updates on actions needed to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in the federal government .
recent legislation intended to reassess the critical functions of ntis that you , chairwoman mccaskill , and senator coburn have introduced , well as the version of the legislation introduced by representatives bridenstine and cuellar , has the potential to address the issues we have identified .
the current legislation presents an opportunity for congress to reconsider and modify this role , taking into account the public's interest in accessing technical , scientific , and engineering information produced by the federal government .
in addition , the 2014 senate appropriations bill for the departments of commerce and justice , and science , and related agencies contains a provision that would , among other things , prohibit ntis from charging for any report or document generated by the legislative branch .
let me google that for you act , s. 2206 , 113th congress , 2nd session ( 2014 ) .
these bills stand to serve as an important vehicle for congress to reexamine the appropriateness and viability of ntis's fee - based model .
during our review , the director of ntis cited factors contributing to the greater availability of this information: ( 1 ) federal agencies are increasingly making information , including scientific , technical , and engineering information products , freely available on their websites ; and ( 2 ) agencies are working with search engines to make their products more readily available to the public .
