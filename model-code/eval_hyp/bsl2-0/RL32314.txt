in 2005 , u.s. companies exported to thailand $7.4 billion in goods and over $1 billion in services .
regionally , the fta is viewed as advancing president bush's enterprise for asean initiative ( eai ) .
for agricultural producers , by eliminating or reducing thailand's high tariffs and other barriers , the fta offers the opportunity to significantly increase export sales to thailand .
from the standpoint of u.s. foreign policy interests , the administration views the proposed fta as strengthening cooperation with thailand in bilateral , regional , and multilateral fora .
the bush administration notified congress on february 12 , 2004 , that it intends to begin free trade agreement ( fta ) negotiations with thailand .
maintaining preferential access for u.s. investors in thailand is also a top priority for u.s. business .
the administration also argued that an fta would help boost u.s. exports of goods and services in sectors such as information technology , telecommunications , financial services , audiovisual , automotive , and medical equipment .
given that thailand is a relatively small economy compared to the united states ( 1 / 100 th "the size" ) , the agreement by itself will have limited effects on the overall u.s. economy .
by eliminating u.s. tariff and non - tariff barriers to thai exports , an fta could help increase the competitiveness and market share of thai products in the u.s. market .
in economic terms , thailand is very concerned that its exports to the united states have been losing market share in recent years to countries such as mexico and china .
zoellick's letter states that an fta would be particularly beneficial to u.s. agricultural producers who have urged the administration to move forward , as well as to u.s. companies exporting industrial goods and services .
bilaterally , the fta is seen as strengthening thailand's position as a key military ally , particularly in the war on terrorism .
as for thailand , similar broad economic and political calculations explain its interest in an fta .
more efficient resource allocation , lower priced imports , and greater selection of goods ) , those industries subject to increased competition face additional pressure to cut costs , wages , and prices .
an fta could encourage thailand to actively cooperate with the united states in supporting multilateral trade negotiations under the aegis of the doha development agenda , particularly in the area of agricultural liberalization .
thailand also does not want to be excluded from fta benefits the u.s. has negotiated with other countries , particularly the potential of an fta to increase u.s. investment in thailand .
multilaterally , thailand plays a key leadership role in the world trade organization ( wto ) .
at the same time , mr. zoellick alluded to sensitive issues that require attention: trade in automobiles , protection of intellectual property rights , and labor and environmental standards .
this notification , which follows an october 19 , 2003 announcement by president bush and former thai prime minister thaskin of their agreement to launch negotiations , allows for talks to begin within 90 days or by mid - may 2004 , after required consultations with congress .
thai stakeholders are also particularly wary , given the high incidence of aids infections , in u.s. efforts to secure data exclusivity for patented pharmaceuticals .
