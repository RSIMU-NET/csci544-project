under the new program , overall federal funding doubled for independent living programs from $70 million to $140 million .
in addition to providing increased funding , fcia resulted in other significant changes for the independent living program .
in response to concerns that youth leave foster care poorly prepared to live self - sufficiently , in 1986 congress created the independent living program , which was further strengthened with the passage of the foster care independence act of 1999 ( fcia ) and creation of the john h. chafee foster care independence program ( chafee program ) .
my testimony today will focus on four key issues as they relate to the implementation of the chafee program: 1. how states' funding allocations for independent living programs compare when considering the number of youth eligible for services , 2. the extent to which states have expanded independent living services and age groups for youth in foster care after the passage of fcia and what challenges remain , 3. the extent to which states have used other federal and state programs to coordinate the delivery of independent living services to foster care youth , and 4. how the states and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) have fulfilled the program accountability provisions of the law and assessed the effectiveness of independent living services .
despite these coordination efforts , some states may not make full use of the available resources .
research studies have shown that many of these young people face serious problems once on their own , including homelessness , a lack of education and stable employment , and difficulties obtaining medical and mental health services .
these recommendations have not been implemented .
states and hhs have taken action to fulfill the accountability provisions of fcia , but little information is available to assess the effectiveness of independent living services .
our 2007 testimony cites a similar recommendation that hhs take action to improve awareness of and access to federal social services by such means as modifying the catalog of federal domestic assistance .
funding varied because of differences in states' eligibility requirements and the funding formula used to allocate funds .
we analyzed federal financial and foster care data .
my comments are based on the findings of a report gao issued in 2004 , with updated information from a may 2007 testimony on challenges facing state child welfare systems .
inconsistent availability of information on the array of programs that were operating in each state and local area was cited as a challenge in promoting coordination in both our prior and more current work .
the information reported in the 2004 report was based on survey responses from independent living coordinators in all 50 states and the district of columbia regarding their experiences in developing and implementing their chafee programs in federal fiscal year 2003 .
for example , securing safe and secure housing was identified as a challenge by youth and program officials in the 4 states we visited , including limited affordable housing in costly urban areas and scarce rental housing in rural areas .
at the time of our review in 2004 , all states had developed their initial multiyear plans for their programs and submitted annual reports to the administration for children and families ( acf ) , but using these plans and the reports to assess state performance was hindered by inconsistencies between the plans and reports , an absence of goals and baseline information to use in measuring progress , and incomplete information on outcomes for all youth who received services .
