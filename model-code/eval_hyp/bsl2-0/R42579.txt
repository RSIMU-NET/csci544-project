some hydropower proponents are pursuing policies to reduce what they view as impediments to hydropower development .
at issue for the 114 th congress is whether , and if so how , to change federal support for hydropower and what priority to give hydropower vis - Ã  - vis other energy investments , and social and environmental concerns .
although there is some interest in increasing the current level of hydropower investment , such investment remains limited , in part because of federal and nonfederal financial constraints , high uncertainty in electricity generation policies and markets ( which may dissuade capital investment ) , and the environmental operating requirements required for hydropower projects .
these issues are ongoing and are shaped by the introduction and consideration of hydropower - related bills from past congresses .
the united states has considerable hydropower potential beyond what is already developed .
so far , four hydropower - related bills have been introduced in the 114 th congress: s. 1236 ( hydropower improvement act of 2015 ) , s. 1264 ( renewable electricity standard act ) , s. 1338 ( small hydropower dependable regulatory order act of 2015 ) , and s. 1270 ( reliable investment in vital energy resources [river] act ) .
other stakeholders prefer that hydropower investments only proceed when they are protective of other interests , including other water users and the aquatic environment and its species .
113-24 ( bureau of reclamation small conduit hydropower development and rural jobs act ) , and p.l .
113-20 ( bonneville unit clean hydropower facilitation act ) , p.l .
and more than 30 hydropower - related bills were introduced in the 113 th congress .
for example , more than 25 bills dealing with various aspects of hydropower were introduced in the 112 th congress , a quarter of which were state - or site - specific legislation .
conventional hydropower accounted for more than 6% ( 258,749 gigawatt hours ) of total net u.s. electricity generation in 2014 .
cited advantages include its possible renewable energy status , zero to minimal greenhouse gas emissions during operation , and high operational efficiency .
for example , congress passed p.l .
over time , there has been a variety of hydropower legislative proposals and stakeholder opinions , which stem partly from differing views of the benefits and costs of hydropower development .
many have pointed out advantages and drawbacks of conventional hydropower .
several federal government agencies own and operate large hydropower projects , while other agencies administer the process by which nonfederal hydropower projects are built , maintained , and operated .
whether the hydropower project investor is a federal or nonfederal entity dictates which laws apply and thus may affect which committees are involved in oversight or changes to such laws .
large federal hydropower projects are managed primarily by the u.s. department of the interior's bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) .
supporters also note its ability to generally serve as a reliable and flexible domestic energy source .
the power from these projects is generally marketed by the department of energy's power marketing administrations ( pmas ) .
