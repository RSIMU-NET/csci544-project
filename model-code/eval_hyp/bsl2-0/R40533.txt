in 2008 , congress passed the health care safety net ( hcsn ) act ( p.l .
nhsc workforce programs intersect with other health safety net programs , such as the health centers program , and health care financing structures under medicare and medicaid .
as legislators consider options for health care reform , the nhsc's potential contributions are of significant interest .
the nhsc is a health safety net program that aims to ( 1 ) add to the supply of primary health care workers through its recruitment programs , ( 2 ) retain primary health care workers in underserved areas , and ( 3 ) increase access to primary health care for underserved populations .
such an imbalance among components of the health safety net , such as a reduction in nhsc clinicians , could result in additional unmet health care needs .
the nhsc's role as a major program for recruiting and retaining primary health care workers is increasingly recognized for its track record in recruiting and retaining primary health care workers , given the boost it received from the economic stimulus legislation ( arra 2009 ) .
these health workforce programs include various authorizations in the public health service ( phs ) act , social security act , and authorities administered in the indian health service , department of defense , and department of veterans affairs .
despite the nhsc's recent reauthorization and increase in funding , policymakers face considerable challenges in providing direction for the nhsc in an era of health care reform and economic constraint .
these interrelationships among health safety programs suggest that as changes in federal policies affect one part of the health safety net , the effects of those policies are felt by the other parts .
this report provides ( 1 ) a descriptive summary of the nhsc ; ( 2 ) appropriation trends ; ( 3 ) a profile of nhsc programs ; ( 4 ) a review of selected program goals and outcomes ; ( 5 ) a survey of the nhsc's workforce capacity ; ( 6 ) a description of the nhsc national advisory committee ; and ( 7 ) an analysis of policy issues that may be of interest to congress .
as an element of the health safety net , the nhsc program complements other federal health workforce programs that support the education and training of health care professionals .
the omnibus appropriation , 2009 ( p.l .
111-8 ) provided $135 million for the nhsc program for fy2009 , which is $12 million more than the fy2008 appropriation of $123 million .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) administers the nhsc through the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , bureau of clinician recruitment and service .
110-355 ) , which reauthorized the nhsc's programs through 2012 .
thus the total fy2009 nhsc funding is $360 million .
the statutory mandate for the nhsc is unique , as the nhsc is one among a few federally supported health workforce programs that retains various primary care clinicians in exchange for benefits provided .
the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) of 2009 , the economic stimulus bill that the president signed into law on february 17 , 2009 , provided an additional $300 million for the nhsc program , of which $225 million is available for fy2009 .
