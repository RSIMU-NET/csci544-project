congressional stakeholders have expressed concern as to whether vera has been designed and implemented to allocate resources commensurate with workload .
in turn , va's networks have budget and management responsibilities that include allocating vera resources to facilities , clinics , and programs within their networks and ensuring equity of access to appropriate health care services .
to address concerns you raised , this report ( 1 ) describes the effect vera has had on network resource allocations and workloads , ( 2 ) assesses whether vera's design is a reasonable approach to resource allocation , and ( 3 ) identifies weaknesses in vera that may limit va's ability to allocate comparable resources for comparable workloads .
since fiscal year 1997 , va has used the veterans equitable resource allocation ( vera ) system to allocate most of its medical care appropriation as part of its overall strategy to reform va health care .
by contrast , vera was intended to equitably allocate health care resources , that is , allocate comparable resources to networks with comparable workloads .
as a health care payer , like the medicare and medicaid programs , va faces the challenge of allocating resources to account for differences in patient workload treated , encourage efficiency , and ensure quality .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) spent about $21 billion for health care in fiscal year 2001 to treat about 3.8 million veteransï£§most of whom had service - connected disabilities or low incomes .
as a direct provider , va also operates a major health care system consisting of 22 regional health care networks that are at risk for budget shortfalls if the cost of providing care to veterans treated by the network is greater than available resources .
prior to vera , va allocated resources primarily on the basis of facilities' historical expenditures .
to examine these issues , we reviewed va documents and consultants' reports on vera's original design , proposed vera changes , and actual vera changes .
as agreed with your offices , we focused our work on vera's allocation of resources from headquarters to the networks but we did not examine the extent to which networks in turn allocate comparable resources for comparable workloads to their respective facilities and programs .
our reviews of vera in its first 2 years concluded that it was an important step forward in equitable resource allocation compared to the allocation practices it replaced .
we also interviewed va headquarters officials and officials in 8 networks , conducted site visits in 5 networks , surveyed all 22 network directors , and interviewed va and other public and private sector health care resource allocation experts .
in addition , we analyzed changes in resources allocated among the 22 networks from fiscal year 1996 through 2001 , changes in the number of veterans treated , and the effect of making adjustments to vera .
we also relied on our more than 10 years of work reviewing va's resource allocation process in addition to other health care financing work .
this included additional resources congress appropriated from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001 .
making changes to address weaknesses in vera will add some complexity to how va allocates resources .
