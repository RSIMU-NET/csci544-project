specifically , we examined and compared the government procurement commitments of trade partners with the top five wto's gpa and active u.s. fta procurement markets .
this report provides information on the commitments made by u.s. trading partners outlined in ( 1 ) the provisions and ( 2 ) the market access schedules of the selected agreements .

according to ustr , beginning with the tokyo round code on government procurement that entered into force in 1981 as part of the general agreement on tariffs and trade , these commitments have potentially opened billions of dollars of procurement to international firms , providing numerous new opportunities for american businesses and government agencies .
in procurements that are covered by these agreements , foreign suppliers are able to compete for certain u.s. government contracts alongside u.s. suppliers , and u.s. suppliers are able to compete for certain foreign government contracts in accordance with the processes established in the agreement .
government procurement constitutes a significant potential market for international trade , with an estimated annual global size of $4.4 trillion , and the united states has played a key role in developing trade agreements that partially open government procurement markets , which are often closed to foreign competition , according to officials from the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) .
we also analyzed and compared the market access - related commitments ( lists of entities and exclusions ) made in the annexes of these agreements that contain coverage schedules .
