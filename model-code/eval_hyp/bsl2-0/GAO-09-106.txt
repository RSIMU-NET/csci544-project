the whistleblower protection program at the department of labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) is responsible for receiving and investigating most whistleblower complaints .
with the exception of the occupational safety and health act , the basic provisions of these statutes are administered by agencies other than the department of labor ( labor ) .
all of the whistleblower provisions are intended to protect non - federal workers in a range of industries , including nuclear power , transportation , pipeline infrastructure , consumer product safety , and securities industries , as well as in several environmental areas .
since the whistleblower program began in 1970 , the number of statutes for which osha is responsible for enforcing whistleblower provisions has increased — recent additions in 2008 bring the total to 17 such statutes .
 ( 3 ) what are the key challenges osha faces in administering the whistleblower program ? .
the whistleblower protection program does not have its own budget , but shares resources with osha's other enforcement programs - - the exact distribution of resources for investigations is decided by each of the 10 regional administrators .
during fiscal year 2007 , osha investigated and closed over 1,800 whistleblower complaints covering 13 statutes .
 ( 2 ) what are the outcomes from complaints filed with the whistleblower protection program ? .
moreover , with the addition of new statutes to the program , caseloads are increasing at all levels .
under the whistleblower provisions , osha has between 30 and 90 days , depending on the statute , to complete its investigation and make its initial findings .
since 2003 , the number of investigators has remained relatively steady ; currently , osha has 69 investigators , 8 supervisory investigators , and 1 program manager assigned to the whistleblower program .
within this context , we addressed the following objectives: ( 1 ) what is known about the processing times for claims under the whistleblower statutes that osha administers and what factors affect processing times ? .
after osha completes its investigation and issues its decision , the whistleblower and his or her employer generally have the right to appeal the decision within labor — for many of the statutes , to the office of administrative law judges ( oalj ) and , ultimately , the administrative review board ( arb ) .
in 2001 , labor's inspector general similarly found that osha was not completing its whistleblower investigations under two other statutes within statutory time frames .
when we last reviewed the whistleblower program in 1988 , we found that osha had not focused sufficient management attention on the program , and that criteria and standards for handling complaints were not consistently followed .
many federal laws and regulations establish a whistleblower protection process , whereby workers who feel they have faced retaliation for blowing the whistle can report their allegations to the appropriate federal agency , which then determines the merit of their claims .
because we had to rely largely on reviewing whistleblower case decisions to gather these data , we focused our efforts on cases closed in fiscal year 2007 .
after this administrative appeals process , either party may , in certain circumstances , bring a legal action in a u.s. district court or a u.s. court of appeals .
