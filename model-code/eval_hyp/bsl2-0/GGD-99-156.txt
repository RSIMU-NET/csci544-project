as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe the availability of information on the nature and extent of consumer complaints about death care industries , ( 2 ) describe and assess the federal trade commission's ( ftc ) efforts to ensure compliance with its funeral rule , and ( 3 ) provide information on selected state governments' roles in protecting consumers in their death care transactions .
you further stated that recent media accounts have focused on the need for consumers to approach death care transactions with considerable caution , especially because these purchases can be some of the most costly and emotionally difficult financial transactions a consumer can make .
you expressed concern about consumers who may be faced with unneeded or inflated expenses or unfair or deceptive sales practices at a time when they are highly vulnerable â€” after the death of a loved one .

from each of these organizations we collected and reviewed available documents on such matters as issues affecting death care industries and consumers , sales and revenues of death care providers and average costs of death care goods and services , and federal and state regulatory issues .
we also did a literature and internet search for information on issues affecting death care industries and consumers and reviewed pertinent books , magazines , trade publications , and periodicals regarding consumer concerns with related death care industries .

we made technical changes as appropriate .
