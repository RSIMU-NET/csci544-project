according to the institute of medicine , an estimated 30% - 40% of health care spending is wasted on unnecessary and even unsafe care .
the final challenge is to eliminate unnecessary and ineffective care that compromises quality , drives up costs , and neglects the needs of patients .
the third challenge is to reduce the burden of chronic disease , which affects almost half of all americans and accounts for three - quarters of health care spending .
improving access to care and controlling rising costs will require changes to both the financing and delivery of health care .
racial and ethnic minorities and low - income groups face disproportionately higher rates of disease , disability , and mortality , largely because of variations in access to care , and quality of care .
the second challenge is to eradicate disparities in care .
in a november 2008 report outlining its goals for health reform , the national priorities partnership , representing all the major stakeholder groups in the health sector , identified four major challenges to the delivery of high - quality care .
health care reform is at the top of the domestic policy agenda for the 111 th congress , driven by concerns about the growing ranks of the uninsured and the unsustainable growth in spending on health care and health insurance .
the first is to improve patient safety by eliminating medical errors and other adverse events .
experts point to a growing body of evidence of the health care system's failure to consistently provide high - quality care to all americans .
these errors mostly result from faulty systems , processes , and conditions that lead to mistakes .
the house legislation also would create a multi - billion dollar public health investment fund to provide additional funds for the programs .
the house legislation would amend numerous phsa programs whose appropriations authority has expired , though many of the programs continue to receive an annual appropriation .
the legislation includes new authorizations for appropriations to fund most of those programs , typically through fy2014 .
as described below , the legislation includes several provisions authorizing the appropriation of amounts from the fund for specified phsa programs .
the report groups the bill's provisions under the following headings: ( 1 ) public health investment fund ; ( 2 ) health centers ; ( 3 ) health workforce , including programs authorized under the public health service act ( phsa ) and under other statutes ; ( 4 ) health care quality ; ( 5 ) health disparities ; ( 6 ) prevention and wellness ; ( 7 ) food and drug administration ; ( 8 ) emergency care ; ( 9 ) behavioral health care ; ( 10 ) pain care and management ; and ( 11 ) miscellaneous .
to ensure that the fund is used to supplement and not supplant regular appropriations , the authority to appropriate amounts from the fund would be contingent on maintaining a certain level of regular appropriations for the programs .
on july 14 , 2009 , representative dingell ( d - mi ) introduced a comprehensive health reform bill , the america's affordable health choices act of 2009 ( h.r .
these amounts would be in addition to any amounts provided through regular appropriations .
