specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) analyze the extent to which fema's key management practices — including strategic planning , human capital planning , intra - agency collaboration , records management , financial management , and acquisition management — affect the agency's ability to administer nfip ; ( 2 ) identify lessons to be learned from the cancellation of its most recent attempt to modernize nfip's flood insurance policy and claims processing system , including to what extent key acquisition management processes were followed ; and ( 3 ) describe factors that are relevant to nfip operations and analyze limitations on fema's authority that could affect its financial stability .
nfip has subsequently borrowed additional funds from treasury to make interest payments on this debt and , as of march 2011 , owed approximately $17.8 billion .
the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) , which is administered by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , is a key component of the federal government's efforts to minimize the damage and financial impact of floods and is the only source of insurance against flood damage for most residents of flood - prone areas .
however , after the 2005 hurricanes — primarily hurricane katrina — the program borrowed $16.8 billion from treasury to cover the unprecedented number of claims .
we also found problems with the oversight of contractors responsible for performing key nfip functions such as collecting nfip data and marketing the program .
because of the risks and challenges facing nfip and the financial and operational weaknesses we had identified , we undertook a review to look for potential underlying management weaknesses that , if addressed , might improve the operation and functioning of the program .
in earlier reports , we identified a number of operational challenges that hindered fema's ability to effectively administer nfip and contributed to nfip's placement on the list .
for example , we found internal control weaknesses in fema's oversight of the write - your - own ( wyo ) insurers that are key to nfip operations and that have received payments representing one - third to two - thirds of the premiums collected .
as a result of the program's importance , level of indebtedness , and potential for future losses , we placed nfip on our high - risk list in march 2006 .
until 2004 , nfip was able to cover most of its claims with premiums it collected and occasional loans from the department of the treasury ( treasury ) that were repaid .
unless it takes further steps to address these management challenges , fema will be limited in its ability to manage nfip's operations or ensure program effectiveness .
further , we reviewed relevant legislation , internal control standards , best practices , and external studies of fema's management challenges .
to address these objectives , we collected available data from fema and conducted over 80 interviews with representatives from fema and their relevant bureaus or divisions .
because of structural weaknesses in the way the program is funded and operated , nfip is unlikely to be able to repay this debt in the near future , if ever .
