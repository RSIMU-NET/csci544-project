without political will and investment from the new enrique peña nieto administration , both the federal government and the states may not meet the 2016 constitutional deadline for implementing judicial reforms enacted in 2008 .
progress has moved forward in many states , but is stalled at the federal level .

congress may also consider weighing in on how implementing agencies divide the assistance provided for judicial reform between the federal and state level reform efforts .
however , if mexico does not prioritize the judicial reforms , congress may question whether funding for such programs in mexico should be discontinued , scaled back , or made contingent upon the federal and state governments demonstrating political will to implement the reforms .
during his confirmation hearing , secretary of state john kerry vowed to try to protect u.s. assistance under the mérida initiative from budget cuts , including support for judicial reform .
