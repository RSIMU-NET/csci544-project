as you requested , i will first briefly summarize state experiences and then focus on provisions regarding gao , the budget enforcement act ( bea ) , and for the government performance and results act ( gpra ) .
when i appeared before you last july i presented testimony on some of the broad issues involved in such a shift .
i would ask also that my july 1996 statement be included in the record along with this statement .
thank you for inviting me back to join you as you consider changing the budget process from an annual to a biennial cycle .
gao reviews of the supplemental security income program have highlighted several long - standing problem areas: ( 1 ) determining initial and continuing financial eligibility for beneficiaries , ( 2 ) determining disability eligibility and performing continuing disability reviews , and ( 3 ) inadequate return - to - work assistance for recipients who may be assimilated back into the work force .
the bill requires appropriations to be enacted every 2 years .
we have reported on long - standing serious weaknesses in the department of defense's ( dod ) financial operations that continue not only to severely limit the reliability of dod's financial information but also have resulted in wasted resources and undermined its ability to carry out its stewardship responsibilities .
in addition , for those entities for which the congress has recognized a programmatic need to have appropriations immediately available at the beginning of the fiscal year ( such as grants to states for medicaid ) , the congress has accommodated this need with advance appropriations .
during the first year of the biennium , authorizations and revenue legislation would be expected to wait until completion of the budget resolution and appropriations bills .
s. 261 would also change some reporting requirements in gpra and add some new reports .
more recently , between 1996 and 1997 , almost 55 percent of budget accounts with current appropriations experienced changes of more than plus or minus 5 percent although total current appropriations declined by about 0.5 percent .
while total current appropriations grew by only 0.9 percent between 1994 and 1995 , more than half of all budget accounts that received current appropriations had net changes greater than plus or minus 5 percent .
our work regarding aviation safety and security has noted that serious vulnerabilities exist in both domestic and international aviation systems .
recent proposals have merit and would fundamentally reinvent the federal aviation administration , but challenges remain , including key questions about how and when the recommendations would be implemented , how much it will cost to implement them , and who will pay the cost .
even in this era of discretionary spending caps , the congress has demonstrated the need to address changing conditions among the numerous budget accounts and program activities of the federal government .
existing provisions of law requiring gao to assist the congress are sufficiently broad to encompass requests such as those envisioned in section 8 of s. 261 .
we have worked closely with this committee , other irs oversight committees , and the appropriations committees in an effort to move irs toward ( 1 ) formulating a much needed business strategy for maximizing electronic filings , ( 2 ) implementing a sound process to manage technology investments , ( 3 ) instituting disciplined processes for software development and acquisition , and ( 4 ) completing and enforcing an essential systems architecture including data and security subarchitectures .
