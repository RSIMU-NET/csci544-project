tsca addresses those chemicals manufactured , imported , processed , distributed in commerce , used , or disposed of in the united states , but excludes certain substances including pesticides regulated under the federal insecticide , fungicide , and rodenticide act ( fifra ) and food additives , drugs , and cosmetics regulated under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) .
i am pleased to appear today before the senate committee on environment and public works , to discuss our work on the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) implementation of the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) .
although these chemicals are an integral component in the production of important goods and services , some may be toxic and may adversely affect human health and / or the environment .
tens of thousands of chemicals are currently in commercial use in the united states and , on average , over 700 new chemicals are introduced into commerce each year .
without government intervention , and often with little or no knowledge of their potential adverse health and environmental impacts , some of these chemicals were produced and used in high volumes .
since congress enacted tsca in 1976 , epa has issued regulations under the act to ban or limit the production of only five existing chemicals or groups of chemicals .
recognizing the need for additional information on existing chemicals , in the late 1990s epa implemented its high production volume ( hpv ) challenge program , under which chemical companies have begun to voluntarily provide test data on about 2,800 chemicals produced or imported in amounts of 1 million pounds or more a year .
it was in this context , that the congress passed tsca in 1976 , authorizing epa to obtain manufacturer information on the risks of chemicals and to control those that epa determines will pose an unreasonable risk .
my testimony today , which is based on our june 2005 report , chemical regulation: options exist to improve epa's ability to assess health risks and manage its chemical review program , describes epa's efforts to ( 1 ) assess existing chemicals used in commerce , ( 2 ) control the risks of new chemicals not yet in commerce , and ( 3 ) publicly disclose information provided by chemical companies under tsca .
however , the fundamental and historical problems the agency has experienced with utilizing its authorities under tsca continue to limit epa's ability to manage its chemical review program and assess chemical risks .
tsca authorizes epa to review those chemicals already in commerce – what are referred to as existing chemicals — and to assess chemicals before they enter commerce – so - called new chemicals .
moreover , epa's ability to provide the public with information on chemical production and risks is hampered by the strict confidential business information provisions of tsca .
since 1998 , epa has focused its efforts on obtaining information on existing chemicals through voluntary programs , such as the hpv challenge program .
earlier legislation on clean water and air had primarily addressed releases of chemicals into the environment .
in this regard , epa officials say the act's legal standards are so high that they have generally discouraged epa from using its authorities to ban or restrict the manufacture or use of chemicals .
