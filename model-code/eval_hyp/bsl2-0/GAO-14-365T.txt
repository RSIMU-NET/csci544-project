this bill includes provisions regarding multiple aspects of the cfats program , including risk assessment , security plan reviews , and facility inspections .

in closing , we anticipate providing oversight over the issues outlined above and look forward to helping this and other committees of congress continue to oversee the cfats program and dhs's progress in implementing this program .
facilities considered to be high - risk in one of four risk - based tiers , require high - risk facilities to develop security plans , review these plans , and inspect the facilities to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements .
4007 would require dhs to consult with the heads of other federal agencies , states and political subdivisions and business associations to identify chemical facilities of interest ; direct dhs to develop a risk assessment approach that includes all elements of risk , including threat data based on available intelligence , the vulnerability of the facility to terrorist attack , and consequence measurements including potential economic consequences ; reaffirm the risk - based performance standard approach to facility security plans and the use of alternative security programs allow chemical facilities to utilize any federal screening program that periodically vets individuals against the terrorist screening database to satisfy the requirements of a personnel surety performance standard ; authorize the use of non - department or non - government entities , with the secretary's approval , for audits and inspections ; and require us to submit a semiannual report to congress containing our assessment of the implementation of the bill .

to conduct our prior work , we reviewed applicable laws and regulations , as well as nppd , ip , and iscd policies and procedures for administering the cfats program and conducting its mission .
additionally , once the cfats program begins performing and completing a sufficient number of compliance inspections , we are mandated review those inspections along with various aspects of them .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts in implementing and managing the chemical facility anti - terrorism standards ( cfats ) program .
my testimony today summarizes our past work on the cfats program and provides our observations on the status of dhs's efforts in four key areas â€” identifying facilities to be covered by cfats , assessing risk and prioritizing covered facilities , reviewing facility security plans , and inspecting facilities to verify compliance with cfats regulations .
