in addition , congress appropriated funding that agencies also attributed to overseas combating terrorism activities .
between fiscal years 2002 and 2005 , funding attributed to homeland security activities increased 39 percent , from $33 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $46 billion for fiscal year 2005 .
in response to the september 11 attacks and the resulting emphasis placed on combating terrorism , congress took legislative action to revise reporting requirements related to federal funding for combating terrorism activities .
for fiscal year 2006 , the president requested nearly $50 billion for activities associated with homeland security .
however , omb is no longer required to report on overseas combating terrorism funding data .
under section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 , the president's annual budget is required to include an analysis of homeland security funding .
according to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , combating terrorism includes efforts to secure the homeland ( that is , homeland security activities to detect , deter , protect against , and , if needed , respond to terrorist attacks occurring within the united states ) and those to combat terrorism overseas ( those activities occurring outside the united states and its territories ) , excluding direct military action .
because combating terrorism funding is embedded within appropriation accounts , agencies provide omb with information on the portion of funding that is attributable to combating terrorism activities — both homeland security and overseas combating terrorism .
this analysis is to be organized by budget function ( i.e. , functions that cover 17 areas of the government such as agriculture and health ) , agency , and initiative area .
much of the funding for combating terrorism activities is embedded within appropriation accounts that finance programs that are not primarily homeland security or overseas combating terrorism related .
according to omb staff responsible for preparing this analysis on behalf of the president , omb adopted the six critical mission areas captured in the national strategy for homeland security — intelligence and warning , border and transportation security , domestic counterterrorism , protecting critical infrastructure and key assets , defending against catastrophic threats , and emergency preparedness and response — to represent initiative areas in its analysis .
this funding supports the uscg's operations both for combating terrorism activities such as securing ports , waterways , and the coast and for non - combating terrorism activities such as ice - breaking operations to facilitate navigation through waterways .
reporting such data along with homeland security funding would greatly improve the transparency of funding attributed to combating terrorism activities across the federal government .
among these other challenges was the difficulty the executive branch faced in measuring the effective use of funds for combating terrorism since clearly defined federal and national performance objectives and measures for assessing programs' progress had not been established .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the administration and congress have increased funding in support of combating terrorism both at home and abroad .
for example , the u.s. coast guard ( uscg ) receives the majority of its appropriations through its operating expenses account .
in november 2002 , we reported on the difficulty the executive branch faced in identifying and tracking combating terrorism funding and other challenges associated with reporting such data to congress .
