this report ( 1 ) describes u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) processes for meeting the act's requirements and ( 2 ) describes how these requirements contribute to u.s. efforts to monitor compliance with the 2006 softwood lumber agreement .
the act also requires gao to report on ( 1 ) whether countries that export softwood lumber or softwood lumber products to the united states are complying with international agreements entered into by those countries and the united states and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of the u.s. government in carrying out the reconciliations and verifications mandated by the softwood lumber act .
in addition , in accordance with our agreement with the senate committee on finance and the house committee on ways and means , in appendixes iii and iv we include updated information on u.s. efforts to monitor compliance , on which we first reported in june 2009 .
in response to the first mandate , gao reported in june 2009 that the u.s. and canadian governments have established mechanisms to monitor compliance with the 2006 softwood lumber agreement , but face operational challenges .
this report primarily addresses the second mandate on u.s. efforts to reconcile and verify softwood lumber data as required by the act .
to address these objectives , we obtained and reviewed planning and programmatic documents describing cbp reconciliation and verification procedures to implement the requirements of the act .
we also interviewed officials from cbp , the department of commerce ( commerce ) , and the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) , to obtain their perspectives on how the act's requirements contribute to monitoring compliance with the bilateral trade agreement and to obtain updated information on compliance concerns with the agreement .
in 2008 , the united states passed the softwood lumber act that requires , among other things , that the u.s. government reconcile and verify softwood lumber trade data .
after several years of litigation related to u.s. allegations of unfair canadian subsidies , the united states and canada signed the 2006 softwood lumber agreement .
the agreement ended ongoing litigation and requires , among other things , the canadian federal and provincial governments to establish export charges and quotas for canadian lumber exports .
in addition , we interviewed officials from canada's department of foreign affairs and international trade ( dfait ) .
it also requires the two countries to exchange information to support monitoring compliance with the agreement .
in 2008 , canada exported approximately $3.2 billion worth of softwood lumber products to the united states , about 17 times the amount supplied by the next biggest exporter to the united states .
 ( see app .
cbp has established mechanisms to comply with its requirements .
we also interviewed industry representatives in both the united states and canada to obtain their perspectives on the act's requirements and the implementation of the bilateral trade agreement .
it is unclear how cbp would implement its continuing requirements under the act and what purpose these requirements would have in the absence of an international agreement .
we traveled to the ports in buffalo , new york , and blaine , washington , to meet with cbp port officials as well as customs brokers representatives .
