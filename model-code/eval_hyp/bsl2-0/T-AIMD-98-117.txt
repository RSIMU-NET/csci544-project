while some progress has been made in addressing the federal government's year 2000 readiness , serious vulnerabilities remain .
much more action is needed to ensure that federal agencies satisfactorily mitigate year 2000 risks to avoid debilitating consequences .
vital economic sectors of the nation are also vulnerable .
these include state and local governments ; telecommunications ; banking and finance ; health , safety , and emergency services ; transportation ; utilities ; and manufacturing and small business .
during the past year , we have issued over 25 reports detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies .
many agencies are behind schedule .
as a result , the upcoming change of century is a sweeping and urgent challenge for public and private - sector organizations .
for this reason , we designated the year 2000 computing problem as a high - risk area for the federal government and published guidance to help organizations successfully address the issue .
at the current pace , it is clear that not all mission critical systems will be fixed in time .
as the world's most advanced and most dependent user of information technology , the united states possesses close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of internet assets .
as a result , if not modified , computer systems or applications that use dates or perform date - or time - sensitive calculations may generate incorrect results beyond 1999. leadership and public / private partnerships essential to confronting the unprecedented challenges posed by the year 2000 crisis .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss the nation's year 2000 computing crisis as well as the year 2000 program being implemented at the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) .
our testimony today outlines year 2000 risks and presents actions that should be taken by the president's council .
we have provided for comment a draft report on these issues to the chairman of the president's council on year 2000 conversion and the office of management and budget ( omb ) and expect to issue it soon .
 .
in addition , at your request , my statement today will include an initial assessment of hud's year 2000 program .
financial transactions could be delayed , airline flights grounded , and national defense affected .
the many interdependencies that exist among governments and within key economic sectors could cause a single failure to have adverse repercussions .
while managers in the government and the private sector are taking many actions to mitigate these risks , a significant amount of work remains , and time frames are unrelenting .
the public faces a risk that critical services could be severely disrupted by the year 2000 computing crisis .
these include ensuring that the government's highest priority systems are corrected and that contingency plans are developed across government .
while hud has attempted to mitigate its year 2000 risks , several systems are behind schedule and actions must be taken to avoid widespread economic repercussions .
other agencies have made progress , although risks remain and a great deal more work is needed .
in particular , the president's council on year 2000 conversion can initiate additional actions needed to mitigate risks and uncertainties .
