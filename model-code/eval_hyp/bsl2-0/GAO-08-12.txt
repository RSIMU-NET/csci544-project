much of the federal framework for port security is contained in the maritime transportation security act of 2002 ( mtsa ) .
efficiently implementing such plans can reduce the potential for unauthorized entry and help prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited to kill people , cause environmental damage , or disrupt transportation systems and the economy .
mtsa establishes requirements for various layers of maritime security , including requiring a national security plan , area security plans , and facility and vessel security plans .
the act calls for various types of facilities to develop and implement a security plan , and it places federal responsibility for approving and overseeing these plans with the department of homeland security ( dhs ) .
to reduce the opportunity for terrorists to exploit security vulnerabilities , as well as to help minimize the effects of accidents or natural disasters , facilities are required to implement security plans to maintain physical , passenger , cargo , and personnel security and may utilize measures such as fences , security guards , and monitoring activities using cameras .
since 2004 , requirements for inspecting maritime facilities have increased .
dhs has placed lead responsibility for this and other mtsa requirements with the u.s. coast guard .
ports and waterways represent attractive targets for terrorist attack , given their importance to the economy , abundance of specific targets , proximity to large populations , and accessibility by water and land .
efforts to address port vulnerabilities face the challenge of having to consider the impact that an increase in security may have on the operation of commerce and the impact on maritime facility operators of costly security requirements .
we reported that facility owners and operators had made progress in developing their security plans but expressed concerns about challenges the coast guard faced in ensuring enough well - trained inspectors and equipping them with adequate guidance to conduct thorough , consistent reviews .
in 2004 we reviewed the implementation of these and other mtsa provisions .
subsequent coast guard guidance in 2003-2004 called for conducting annual on - site inspections to verify a facility's compliance with its security plan .
the security of more than 3,200 terminals , chemical plants , factories , and power plants plays an important role in the protection of our nation's ports .
the guidance also calls for the coast guard to provide additional oversight at any time based on perceived risk .
as vital as ports are to the country , they are susceptible to terrorist acts due to their size and openness â€” easily accessible by water and land and are attractive targets given the proximity of many ports to urban areas and collocation with power plants , oil refineries , and other energy facilities .
the importance and potential vulnerability of our nation's ports are well documented .
this report addresses the extent to which the coast guard has met its maritime facility inspection requirements and has found facilities to be in compliance with their security plans , has determined the availability of trained personnel to meet current and future facility inspection requirements , and has assessed the effectiveness of its mtsa facility oversight program and ensured that program compliance data collected and reported are reliable .
actions to improve security are undertaken with the knowledge that total security cannot be bought no matter how much is spent on it because of the difficulty of anticipating and addressing all security concerns .
