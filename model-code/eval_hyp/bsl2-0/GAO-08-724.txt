however , cms has encouraged state medicaid programs to consult with tribes when making changes to their medicaid programs .
moreover , some states have policies requiring consultation between the state medicaid program and indian tribes .
this report ( 1 ) describes interactions between cms and ihs , ( 2 ) examines mechanisms cms uses to interact and consult with indian tribes , ( 3 ) examines mechanisms that selected states' medicaid programs use to interact and consult with indian tribes , and ( 4 ) identifies barriers to enrollment in medicare and medicaid and efforts to help eligible american indians and alaska natives apply for and enroll in these programs .
while states have flexibility in making many changes to their medicaid programs , some changes require states to obtain a waiver of certain medicaid requirements .
interactions between indian tribes , ihs , and the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within hhs that administers medicare and oversees states' medicaid programs , can help prevent policy changes from having unforeseen effects on tribes and ihs - funded facilities .
specifically , the social security act authorizes the secretary of hhs to waive certain federal medicaid program requirements under certain conditions .
reimbursement from medicare and medicaid can increase the amount of funds available to ihs - funded facilities because by law they can retain reimbursement from these programs without an offsetting reduction in their appropriated funding .
given the importance of cms programs to american indians and alaska natives , you asked us to examine the interactions between the medicare and medicaid programs with ihs - funded facilities .
in fiscal year 2007 , ihs reported approximately $677 million in reimbursement from medicare and medicaid ; however , facilities vary greatly in the total reimbursement obtained from these programs .
however , cms has provided guidance to state medicaid programs that encourages the programs to consult with tribes and be as responsive as possible to their issues and concerns when making changes to state medicaid programs .
changes to medicare and medicaid can affect the enrollment of american indians and alaska natives in these programs and the ability of ihs - funded facilities to claim reimbursement for enrolled individuals .
ihs is funded through appropriations , which in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 were approximately $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion , respectively .
in contrast , states are not subject to the executive order or hhs's tribal consultation policy .
thus , cms is required to consult with indian tribes on program issues that have tribal implications .
for example , if changes in a medicaid program's delivery system — such as moving to a system of managed care — are discussed with tribes and ihs officials , then consequences — such as ihs - funded facilities not being part of managed care systems — may be avoided .
in addition to federal appropriations , ihs - funded facilities can seek reimbursement for services they provide to individuals enrolled in medicare , the federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled individuals , and for those enrolled in medicaid , a joint federal and state health financing program for certain low - income families and low - income individuals who are aged or disabled .
