in recent years , some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the federal deficit and debt .
other members of congress have expressed support for increased federal spending for r&d as an investment in the nation's future competitiveness .
its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense , health , safety , the environment , and energy security ; advancing knowledge generally ; developing the scientific and engineering workforce ; and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .
in recent years , widespread concerns about the federal debt , recent and projected federal budget deficits , and federal budget caps have driven difficult decisions about the prioritization of r&d , both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal r&d portfolio .
agency r&d budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process .
congress plays a central role in defining the nation's r&d priorities as it makes decisions about the level and allocation of r&d funding â€” overall , within agencies , and for specific programs .
increases in the budget caps for fy2018 and fy2019 reduced some of the pressure affecting these decisions , but the concerns remain and the caps for fy2020 have not been increased .
agency budgets are subjected to review , revision , and approval by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and become part of the president's annual budget submission to congress .
r&d funding may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to r&d or in accounts that include funding for non - r&d activities .
the u.s. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering r&d .
the federal r&d budget is an aggregation of the r&d activities of these agencies .
as congress acts to complete the fy2020 appropriations process , it faces two overarching issues: the amount of the federal budget to be spent on federal r&d and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding .
most of the r&d funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies .
the federal r&d budget is then calculated by aggregating the r&d activities of each federal agency .
the 116 th congress continues its interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites , shale gas extraction , and defenses against disease .
there is no single , centralized source of r&d funds .
the remainder of the report discusses and analyzes the r&d budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that , collectively , account for approximately 99% of total federal r&d funding .
