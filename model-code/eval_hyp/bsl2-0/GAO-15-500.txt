the sab and casac are both federal advisory committees and therefore must comply with the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) and its implementing regulations .
casac also has subcommittees and panels .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) uses scientific studies and methodologies when formulating rules to protect the environment and public health .
the clean air act requires epa to set and periodically review and revise naaqs for certain air pollutants , the emission of which cause or contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare .
this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional committees' requests for scientific advice from the sab ensure compliance with erddaa ; ( 2 ) the extent to which casac has provided advice related to naaqs ; and ( 3 ) policies , if any , epa has to ensure the sab and casac maintain their independence from the agency when performing their work .
for example , epa requests and obtains advice and recommendations from the science advisory board ( sab ) and the clean air scientific advisory committee ( casac ) .
epa seeks to enhance the quality and credibility of such rules by obtaining reviews from experts of the underlying studies and methodologies .
the environmental research , development , and demonstration authorization act of 1978 ( erddaa ) mandated that epa establish the sab and required the sab to provide the epa administrator with scientific advice as requested .
in addition , epa must have procedures to ensure that the advice or recommendations of its federal advisory committees , including the sab and casac , are products of their independent judgment and not “inappropriately” influenced by epa .
casac was established pursuant to amendments to the clean air act in 1977 to , among other things , provide advice to the administrator with regard to epa's national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) .
in 1980 , congress amended erddaa by adding a provision requiring the sab to also provide scientific advice to designated congressional committees when requested .
the sab , its staff office , and casac report directly to the epa recent interactions between the house committee on science , space , and technology and the sab related to specific sab reviews on hydraulic fracturing and water body connectivity have raised questions with the committee regarding whether the sab is fulfilling its statutory obligations to provide scientific advice to the designated congressional committees.in addition , recent testimony received by the committee has raised questions regarding whether casac is carrying out its statutory obligations to advise epa of any adverse public health , welfare , social , economic , or energy effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of naaqs .
the epa administrator appoints members to the sab ( and its standing committees ) and casac , and the sab staff director appoints consultants to the sab ad hoc committees , panels , and workgroups and casac subcommittees and panels .
to examine the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional committees' requests for scientific advice from the sab ensure compliance with erddaa , we reviewed erddaa and its legislative history , the sab's charters , legal cases involving the sab , and epa documents to determine how requests to the sab from congressional committees were addressed .
