the federal health center program is authorized in section 330 of the public health service act ( phsa ) and supports four types of health centers: ( 1 ) community health centers ; ( 2 ) health centers for the homeless ; ( 3 ) health centers for residents of public housing ; and ( 4 ) migrant health centers .
the program is administered by the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) — specifically by its bureau of primary care — within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
it also describes the federal programs available to assist health center operations including the federally qualified health center ( fqhc ) designation for medicare and medicaid payments .
the report concludes with a brief discussion of issues for congress such as the potential effects of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 ( aca ) on health centers ( both the program and individual health centers ) , the health center workforce , and financial considerations for health centers in the context of changing federal and state budgets .
finally , the report has two appendices that describe ( 1 ) fqhc payments for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries served at health centers ; and ( 2 ) programs that are similar to health centers but not authorized in section 330 of the phsa .
this report provides an overview of the federal health center program including its statutory authority , program requirements , and appropriation levels .
according to hrsa data , over 9,400 unique health center sites ( i.e. , individual health center facility locations ) exist ; the majority are community health centers ( chcs ) .
the federal health center program awards grants to support health centers: outpatient primary care facilities that provide care to primarily low - income individuals .
chcs serve the general low income or otherwise disadvantaged population , whereas the remaining three types of health centers provide care to more targeted low income or otherwise disadvantaged populations ( e.g. , migrant health workers ) .
data compiled by hrsa demonstrate that health centers serve the intended safety net population as the majority of patients are uninsured or enrolled in medicaid .
these requirements make health centers part of the health safety net — providers that serve the uninsured , the underserved , or those enrolled in medicaid .
regardless of type , health centers are required , by statute , to provide health care to all individuals regardless of their ability to pay and are required to be located in geographic areas that have few health care providers .
the report then describes health centers in general , where they are located , their patient population , and some outcomes associated with health center use .
these include ( 1 ) the role of health centers in health insurance expansions under the aca , ( 2 ) the adequacy of the health center workforce , and ( 3 ) financial challenges that health centers may face .
health care access has traditionally been an issue of congressional concern .
for example , health centers may be affected by the mandatory budget reductions that may be required as part of the budget control act ( p.l .
