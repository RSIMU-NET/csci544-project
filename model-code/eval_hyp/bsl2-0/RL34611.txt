the three measures are the energy independence and security act ( h.r .
these bicameral units often write the final version of major measures that both chambers will vote upon .
it is not that conference committees are unimportant , it is that another method for adjusting and reconciling bicameral differences on significant legislation has taken on greater prominence in the contemporary congress .
conference committees have long been known as "the third house of congress. .
this apparent development merits some attention and analysis .
current developments suggest , however , that the "third house" characterization might require modification .
in a bicameral legislature like the u.s. congress , they are usually the principal forum for reconciling major bills passed in dissimilar form by the two houses .
as one senator said , conferences are "where the final touches are put on legislation which constitutes the laws of the country. .
or as a congressional scholar put it , in "the legislative process , all roads lead to the conference committee. .
if the conference committee is being somewhat eclipsed by the ping pong procedure as an important way to achieve bicameral reconciliation on consequential legislation , that would represent an important institutional change .
the tree - filling maneuver may not have been necessary or appropriate because , for example , the bicameral compromise enjoyed broad bipartisan support ; tree - filling might create more legislative problems than it could solve , such as arousing the ire of lawmakers who wanted to offer amendments of their own ; or deadline pressures prompted agreement to the bicameral accord .
key bicameral actors typically craft policy compromises in closed session and then use the amendment exchange method to win house - senate agreement on them .
accordingly , this report's purposes are fundamentally twofold: to examine the reasons for the heightened salience of the ping pong approach and to consider several reasons for and the implications that seem to flow from using this procedure rather than convening conferences to resolve inter - chamber disagreements on major legislation .
first , it will provide an overview of the methods congress employs to achieve inter - chamber agreement on legislation , including ping pong's place in the bicameral resolution process .

procedures usually are not isolated actions ; they are employed in a policy , political , and legislative context .
some lawmakers even state that conferences are becoming a thing of the past .
on capitol hill , private negotiating sessions and discussions among house and senate members are a day - to - day occurrence ; these confidential meetings influence lawmaking from the introduction of a bill to bicameral reconciliation .
third , it will examine why there seems to be more reliance in recent years on the ping pong method in reconciling bicameral differences on significant legislation than on the conference committee route .
formal conferences are becoming rare. .
still , tree - filling can sometimes be a useful procedure in facilitating passage of priority legislation , which is why these measures were chosen for examination .
