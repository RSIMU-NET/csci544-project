eliminating or reducing inefficiencies at the border may facilitate trade by lowering costs for importers ( and possibly consumers ) , as well as exporters .
furthermore , decreasing trade barriers at the border enables connectivity and may increase a country's foreign direct investment ( fdi ) inflows .
improved trade flows require effective implementation of the tfa by all wto members .
while the tfa mandatory provisions are subject to wto dispute settlement for enforcement , the agreement contains the special and differential treatment provisions to provide additional implementation time and technical assistance and capacity building assistance for developing and least - developed countries .
the united states is already in compliance with most measures represented in the tfa , and thus does not have to change its current practices to comply with the tfa provisions .
the tfa does not require further congressional approval because u.s. compliance with the agreement's commitments does not require changes to u.s. law .
this report discusses the tfa , its background and current status , potential impact on u.s. trade agreement provisions , plans for implementation , and relevant policy options for congress to consider .
the tfa aims to reduce trade costs by streamlining , modernizing , and speeding up the customs processes for cross border trade .
thus , improving trade flows benefits both exporting and importing countries and can be seen as a shared interest across all wto members .
by increasing transparency , instilling good governance practices , and simplifying processes at the border , the potential for corruption is also reduced .
the tfa is important to congress because it may affect u.s. trade flows , the u.s. economy , and international capacity building efforts .
the trade facilitation agreement ( tfa ) , finalized in december 2013 , is the newest international trade agreement to enter into force at the world trade organization ( wto ) , after two - thirds of wto member countries ratified the multilateral agreement as of february 22 , 2017 .
existing and proposed u.s. free trade agreements ( ftas ) include trade facilitation commitments .
tfa implementation could potentially have multiple positive outcomes , including improved customs clearance processes for exports and imports ; improved predictability and management of gvcs ; minimized loss of perishable goods due to reduced wait and processing times ; increased sme exports due to lower trade costs ; increased inflows of foreign direct investment ( fdi ) for small countries ; improved and faster collection of taxes , fees , and duties ; and decreased corruption at borders due to increased automation and transparency .
according to wto estimates , export gains from full implementation of the tfa could range from $750 billion to over $3.6 trillion dollars per year .
modernizing customs and border processes can have benefits for both international businesses and exporters as well as domestic customers and government agencies .
part of the u.s. international trade commission's ( itc's ) statutory function is to examine the potential impact of trade deals on the u.s. economy for congress and the white house .
for example , there have been ongoing issues with south korea's implementation of korus provisions on express delivery shipment inspection and delays .
similarly , the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) finds that tfa implementation could lower trade costs 12.5% - 17.5% globally .
