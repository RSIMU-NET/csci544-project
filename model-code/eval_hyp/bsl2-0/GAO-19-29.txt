the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2017 includes a provision for us to review — during each of fiscal years 2017 through 2021 — dod's processes for addressing the recommendations of the nuclear enterprise reviews .
in 2015 , dod conducted a review focused on nuclear command , control , and communications ( nc3 ) systems , which resulted in a report ( hereafter referred to as the 2015 nc3 report ) with recommendations to address diffused responsibility , accountability , and authority for the nc3 enterprise ; ineffective life - cycle management programs ; and a lack of institutional training and personnel management programs .
dod and the military services have improved oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise and managed roles , responsibilities , and collaboration among various organizations .
we also recommended that the dod chief information officer ( cio ) develop guidance to improve the tracking and evaluation of dod's progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2015 nc3 report .
in october 2017 , we recommended that the office of cost assessment and program evaluation ( cape ) develop additional guidance on the identification of risks and the documentation of these risks in dod's centralized tracking tool for the recommendations of the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews .
together , the two reports and a memorandum from the u.s. strategic command commander with additional areas for improvement ( hereafter referred to collectively as the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews ) identified problems with leadership , organization , investment , morale , policy , and procedures , as well as other shortcomings that adversely affected the nuclear deterrence mission .
in july 2016 , we reported that the process dod had developed for tracking the 2014 review recommendations generally appeared consistent with relevant criteria from standards for internal control in the federal government — including using and effectively communicating quality information and performing monitoring activities .
we are also to review dod's process for implementing recommendations from other assessments of the nuclear enterprise , including the 2015 nc3 report , and to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on the results of our review .
dod and the military services have made progress in the implementation , tracking , and evaluation — including identifying and documenting risk — of the recommendations of the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 nc3 report and 2 .
we also reviewed applicable guidance , such as the secretary of defense's 2014 memorandum ( nuclear enterprise review corrective action implementation ) , the 2016 deputy secretary of defense memorandum ( transition of nuclear enterprise review tracking responsibilities , which includes cape's nuclear enterprise review tracking analytic guidance overview ) , and cape's january 2018 updated guidance on risk ( additional guidance for nuclear enterprise review recommendation tracking ) .
dod concurred with these recommendations , and we discuss its efforts to address them later in this report .
in 2014 , as a response to incidents involving the nation's nuclear forces and their senior leadership , the secretary of defense directed an internal review and an independent review of the department of defense ( dod ) nuclear enterprise .
for objective one , we reviewed key documents , including the centralized dod tracking tool for 2014 recommendations , the military services' internal tracking tools for the 2014 recommendations , and the dod cio's tracking tool for the 2015 recommendations .
