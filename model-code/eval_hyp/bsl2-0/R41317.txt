congress is currently reviewing u.s. farm policy before commodity provisions in the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( p.l .
110-246 ; the 2008 farm bill ) expire in 2012 .
for example , crop farmers and landowners receive counter - cyclical payments ( ccp ) when crop revenue declines below a certain level .
several farm programs contain elements of a safety net , which is intended to protect farmers against risks or ensure a minimum level of economic well - being .
the report also examines budget and policy issues and discusses implications for u.s. farm policy in the context of the world trade organization ( wto ) .
roughly every five years , congress debates and revises omnibus legislation — referred to as the "farm bill" — governing federal farm and food policy .
the u.s. department of agriculture and the broader farming community often refer to the price and income support programs of the farm bill's title i and the crop insurance and disaster assistance programs of title xii as encompassing the farm safety net .
while many critics of farm subsidies take issue with what does and does not constitute a safety net and whether current farm programs actually perform as such , this report uses the term safety net as a catchall descriptor rather than an assessment of the safety net merits of the various programs .
in contrast , one of the largest farm budget outlays — "direct payments" — delivers nearly $5 billion every year to the same set of owners of agricultural base acres irrespective of the level of commodity prices or whether the land is farmed .
this report provides a brief description of the current farm safety net programs as a background for the congressional debate that is expected to precede the next round of omnibus farm legislation in 2012 .
a major topic is the so - called "farm safety net. .
since most governing provisions over u.s. farm programs are statutory , new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance .
recent and growing federal budget deficits have increased calls within both congress and the administration for fiscal restraint and government - wide spending reductions .
others , including budget hawks , have long argued that farm subsidies are an unfair market - distorting use of taxpayer dollars .
in contrast , many environmental groups argue that these subsidies encourage overproduction on environmentally fragile land using excessive pesticides and fertilizers .
in particular , u.s. domestic agricultural policy is subject to commitments made under the wto's agreement on agriculture ( aa ) and , to the extent that domestic policy effects spill over into international markets , u.s. farm policy is also subject to certain rules under the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures ( scm ) .
the united states is expected to bring both programs into wto compliance or be subject to wto - sanctioned retaliation .
many policymakers and farmers consider federal support of farm businesses necessary for their financial survival , given the unpredictable nature of agricultural production and markets .
as provided under the 2008 farm bill and other legislation , farm safety net programs can be divided into three main categories ( as shown in figure 1 and table 1 ) : c ommodity programs provide income support and attempt to address farm price or revenue risk for selected field crops ; risk management provides protection from declines in yield or revenue for a much broader set of commodities , including many field and specialty crops and some livestock ; and supplemental disaster assistance is available for most commodities ( crops and livestock ) when weather - related losses are not covered by other programs .
