this letter responds to your request of january 6 , 1998 , and in subsequent discussions , that we assist the subcommittee by ( 1 ) determining which entities or companies engage in telephone slamming violations â€” the unauthorized switching of a customer from one long - distance provider to another ; ( 2 ) determining the process by which the providers defraud consumers ; and ( 3 ) reviewing what the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , state regulatory entities , and the telecommunications industry have done to curtail slamming .
but according to the fcc , slamming is a growing problem: the complaints received by the fcc have grown from under 2,000 in 1993 to over 20,000 in 1997 .
telephone customers who are victims of intentional slamming can be harmed in a number of ways ranging from having to pay higher , sometimes exorbitant , long - distance rates to being unable to use the calling cards of their provider of choice .
i ) , apparently slammed over 500,000 consumers , through his companies , in one effort .
determining the prevalence of telephone slamming is very difficult because no central repository for slamming complaints exists .
further , one local telephone exchange company ( another general recipient of slamming complaints ) reported receiving over 80,000 complaints in the first 9 months of 1997 alone .
indeed , daniel h. fletcher , the owner / operator of the companies discussed in our case study ( see app .
in addition , you asked that we present a case study of a long - distance company that repeatedly slammed consumers as a standard business practice .
in addition , the fcc lags far behind some individual state regulatory agencies in the amount of fines imposed on companies for slamming .
the fcc first adopted antislamming measures in 1985 and has subsequently promulgated regulations to improve its antislamming efforts .
collectively , slamming increases the costs to long - distance providers and other firms involved in this industry .
some states have taken significant action to protect consumers from slamming , but others have taken little action or have no antislamming regulations .
it distorts telecommunications markets by enabling companies engaged in misleading practices to increase their customer bases , revenues , and profitability through illegal means .
in addition , slammed consumers are often overcharged , according to the fcc and the industry ; are unable to use their preferred long - distance service ; cannot use calling cards in emergencies or while traveling ; and lose premiums ( e.g. , frequent flyer miles or free minutes of long - distance calls ) provided by their properly authorized provider .
of the antislamming efforts , those by some states are the most extensive .
their increased costs occur when slamming victims refuse to pay the charges of unauthorized service providers or when slammers themselves take the profits and leave unpaid bills , sometimes amounting to millions of dollars .
as a consequence , consumers and the industry itself are becoming increasingly vulnerable as targets for large scale fraud .
further , according to fcc's deputy director for enforcement , common carrier bureau , enforcement division , the fcc relies largely on state regulatory agencies and the industry's self - regulating measures for antislamming efforts .
