the 12 agencies are the department of defense ( dod ) ; department of education ( education ) ; environmental protection agency ( epa ) ; national science foundation ( nsf ) ; and 8 agencies within the department of health and human services — administration for children and families ( acf ) , administration for community living ( acl ) , agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) , cdc , centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , national institutes of health ( nih ) , and the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) .
human services ( hhs ) and monitor federal activities related to autism across the federal government .
however , research shows that early intervention and treatment services can greatly improve a child's development .
my remarks today will focus on two areas: ( 1 ) the extent to which federal agencies fund potentially duplicative autism research and other autism - related activities , and ( 2 ) the extent to which the iacc and agencies coordinate and monitor federal autism activities .
the most recent estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) indicate that at least 1 in 68 children in the united states have been identified as having autism .
autism is a complex developmental disorder that begins during early childhood , characterized by impaired social interactions , problems with verbal and nonverbal communication , and repetitive behaviors , or by severely limited activities and interests .
however , the involvement of multiple agencies can also make it challenging to identify gaps and efficiently allocate resources across the federal government .
to fulfill these requirements , the iacc holds meetings and has issued several reports including a strategic plan for autism research , which the caa requires the iacc to develop and annually update .
these criteria include key practices for interagency coordination and collaboration , and federal internal control standards related to communicating with external entities , including other federal agencies , and measuring progress on organizational efforts , such as those established through strategic plans .
the strategic plan is organized into seven research areas with specific short - and long - term research objectives , and contains a total of 78 objectives .
there is no single known cause of autism and there is no known cure .
the national institutes of health ( nih ) — an agency within hhs — created the office of autism research coordination ( oarc ) to provide administrative support to the iacc .
this report is organized by the same seven research areas and includes information on research projects funded by federal and nonfederal entities related to autism , including budget information , for a single fiscal year .
one such advantage is that agencies may be better able to tailor research or other programs to suit their specific missions and needs .
my remarks are based primarily on our report , released in november 2013 , entitled federal autism activities: better data and more coordination needed to help avoid the potential for unnecessary duplication .
the iacc also issues an annual autism spectrum disorder research portfolio analysis report .
