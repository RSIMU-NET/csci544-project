this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies used noncompetitive contracts to procure it products and services for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 ; ( 2 ) the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts for selected it procurements ; ( 3 ) the extent to which it procurements at selected agencies were bridge contracts ; and ( 4 ) the extent to which noncompetitive it procurements at selected agencies were in support of legacy systems .
in addition , our past work found that agencies are investing most of their it dollars on maintaining legacy it systems , which are becoming increasingly obsolete .
to examine the extent to which agencies used noncompetitive contracts and orders to procure it products and services , we analyzed government - wide federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) data on it obligations from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 ( the most recent and complete data available ) .
prior it expenditures , however , have too often produced failed projects — that is , projects with multimillion dollar cost overruns and schedule delays and with questionable mission - related achievements .
the government , in these instances , runs the risk of maintaining systems that have outlived their effectiveness .
the federal government obligates tens of billions of dollars for products and services related to information technology ( it ) each year .
for example , in may 2016 , we found that many systems use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are no longer supported by their vendors .
however , in october 2015 , we found that some bridge contracts spanned multiple years , potentially undetected by approving officials .
for the last objective , you requested that we ascertain the extent to which our generalizable sample of contracts and orders were in support of legacy systems as defined by the modernizing government technology act ( mgt ) , which was enacted in december 2017 , after our work was underway .
when noncompetitive bridge contracts are used frequently or for prolonged periods , the government is at risk of paying more than it should for products and services .
meeting the federal government's it needs is critical to the health , economy , and security of the nation .
to define it , we used the office of management and budget's ( omb ) category management leadership council list of it product and service codes to identify it - related products and services .
you asked us to review the federal government's use of noncompetitive contracts for it , including the use of bridge contracts .
in addition , there are competition - related requirements for other types of contract vehicles , including multiple award indefinite - delivery / indefinite - quantity ( idiq ) contracts and the general services administration's ( gsa ) federal supply schedule ( fss ) .
to determine the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts and orders for selected it procurements , we selected the three agencies with the highest reported obligations on it noncompetitive contracts for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 ( the most recent year of data available at the time we began our review ) — the departments of defense ( dod ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and health and human services ( hhs ) .
