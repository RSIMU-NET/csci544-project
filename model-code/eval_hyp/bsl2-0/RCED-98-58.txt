in response to your request , this report discusses ( 1 ) the lessons that can be learned from efforts by nonfederal land managers to generate revenue and / or become financially self - sufficient from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands and ( 2 ) legal and other barriers that may preclude the forest service from implementing similar efforts on its lands .

over $2.0 billion in appropriations and over $0.4 billion in trust funds were available to manage the system's 155 national forests .
in fiscal year 1996 , revenue generated from the sale or use of resources and lands within the national forest system totaled about $0.9 billion .
the department of agriculture's forest service manages about 192 million acres of land â€” nearly 9 percent of the nation's total surface area ( about the size of california , oregon , and washington state combined ) and about 30 percent of all federal lands .
under the national forest management act of 1976 ( nfma ) and its implementing regulations , the forest service is to ( 1 ) recognize wilderness as a use of the forests and ( 2 ) maintain the diversity of plant and animal communities ( biological diversity ) .
nepa and its implementing regulations specify procedures for integrating environmental considerations through environmental analyses and for incorporating public input into the agency's decision - making process .
the forest service must comply with the requirements of the national environmental policy act of 1969 ( nepa ) .
the forest service is subject to more than 200 laws affecting its activities and programs .
nepa requires that a federal agency prepare a detailed environmental impact statement ( eis ) for every major federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment .
in planning and reaching decisions , the forest service must also comply with the requirements of other environmental statutes , including the endangered species act , the clean water act , the clean air act , the wilderness act , and the migratory bird treaty act , as well as other laws , such as the national historic preservation act .
the act also requires the agency to manage its lands to provide high levels of all of these uses to current users while sustaining undiminished the lands' ability to produce these uses for future generations ( the sustained - yield principle ) .
