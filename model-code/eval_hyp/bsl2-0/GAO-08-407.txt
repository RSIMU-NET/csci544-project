since 2002 , dod has repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought enactment of the three remaining provisions , which would exempt dod from certain requirements of the clean air act ; the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) ; and the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) .
pursuant to the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 and the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 , the readiness and range preservation initiative provisions revising the migratory bird treaty act , the endangered species act and the marine mammal protection act were enacted into law .
in 2002 , dod submitted to congress an eight - provision legislative package known as the readiness and range preservation initiative , which contained six provisions that sought to modify the applicability of certain environmental statutory requirements to dod , in light of concern that these statutes could limit realistic preparations for combat and negatively affect military readiness .
dod officials report that the gradual accumulation of these limitations will increasingly threaten readiness .
this report discusses the effects , if any , of ( 1 ) environmental laws on dod's training activities and military readiness , ( 2 ) dod's use of exemptions from environmental laws on training activities , and ( 3 ) dod's use of exemptions on the environment .
however , according to dod officials , a slow but steady increase in restrictions affecting the use of these areas , such as heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes and other encroachment pressures , has limited the use of military training areas for realistic training activities .
most existing environmental laws allow for national security exemptions , which dod may request on a case - by - case basis when compliance with specific environmental requirements is shown to have an impact on the paramount interests of the united states .
house armed services committee report 110-146 , which accompanies the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , directed us to review the extent to which environmental laws , regulations , and exemptions are affecting dod's training activities , military readiness , and the environment .
like other federal , state , local , and private facilities , dod installations are required to comply with environmental and other laws that are intended to protect human health and the environment from harm .
we also noted individual instances of environmental requirements affecting training at some military installations and recommended that dod's readiness reporting system be improved to more accurately identify problems for training that might be attributed to the need to comply with statutory environmental requirements .
over the past several years , we have produced a body of work describing the effects of encroachment on dod's training activities , including encroachment from endangered species .
to date , dod has received or invoked exemptions under the coastal zone management act ( czma ) , endangered species act , marine mammal protection act , and rcra .
in 2003 , we testified that environmental requirements were only one of several factors that affected dod's ability to carry out training activities but that dod was still unable to broadly measure the effects of encroachment on readiness .
