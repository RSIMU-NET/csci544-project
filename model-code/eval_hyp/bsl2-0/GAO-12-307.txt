most recently , in march 2011 , we reported that such a replacement would result in a net benefit of about $5.5 billion over 30 years , or an average of about $184 million per year .
we have reported five times over the past 22 years that replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would provide a net benefit to the federal government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
to determine the estimated net benefit , we developed a model based on a set of assumptions and noted that changing these assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated net benefit .
you asked us to provide additional details on our 2011 analysis and to conduct additional analyses changing two assumptions .
over the past 40 years , many countries have replaced lower - denomination notes with coins as a means to provide a financial benefit to their governments .
to answer your request , we first updated our 2011 estimate because of recent changes by the federal reserve and department of treasury in note processing and $1 coin production , the results of which are provided below .
we found that this benefit was entirely attributable to an increase in seigniorage , which is the difference between the cost of producing coins or notes and their face value .
as such , these analyses are highly affected by changing conditions as well as by conceptual views on certain key issues , such as seigniorage and replacement ratios .
we then used this updated 30-year estimate to address your request that we provide the specific benefit or loss to the government for each of the first 10 years for our 30-year analysis ; the net benefit or loss to the government over 10 years if the interest savings due to seigniorage is excluded from the analysis ; and the net benefit or loss to the government over 10 years if the replacement ratio is 1 coin to 1 note , rather than 1.5 coins for 1 note , as we assumed in our 30-year analysis .
to identify the benefit or loss of replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin , we updated the economic model developed for our 2011 report , and varied the assumptions for seigniorage and the replacement ratio of coins to notes as requested .
briefly , our model estimated net benefit or net loss to the government by subtracting the benefit of a status quo scenario from a replacement scenario .
in the updated status quo scenario , notes remain the dominant form of currency at the $1 denomination , the united states mint ( the mint ) ceases production of $1 coins , the currently stored coins are gradually released into circulation to meet transactional demand , and production of $1 coins resumes after the stored coins are released.the replacement scenario , we assumed , among other things , that the production of $1 notes would stop immediately ; no notes would be withdrawn from circulation , but because of their shorter life span , they would naturally fall out of circulation within a few years ; the $1 coins in storage would immediately be released into circulation ; and the mint would produce a large number of $1 coins during the first 4 years of the transition .
