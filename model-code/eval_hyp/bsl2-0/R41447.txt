the election has opened debates about u.s. policy towards burma , including questions about whether the largely isolationist policy of the past 20 years , marked by extensive economic sanctions against the regime for its human rights violations , has been effective in encouraging political change and improving the government's treatment of the burmese people ; whether the obama administration's decision to engage the burmese government can be effective ; and whether sanctions are sufficiently strict and sufficiently well - enforced to pressure the junta to improve its human rights policies .
whether it was the manner in which a new constitution was supposedly approved or the provisions of the elections laws , several members of congress and the obama administration have been critical of the process by which burma's ruling military junta , the state peace and development council ( spdc ) , plans on conducting the election .
as the election moves into its campaign phase , there continue to be signs that the results are unlikely to be free and fair , and may not reflect the political wishes of the burmese people .
the pending parliamentary elections in burma — to be held on november 7 , 2010 — sparked controversy even before the date was set .
on november 7 , 2010 , burma ( also known as myanmar ) will hold its first parliamentary elections in 20 years .
on may 27 , 1990 , burma held parliamentary elections in which the opposition national league for democracy ( nld ) won 392 seats out of 485 seats .
since then , burma has been ruled by a military junta , renamed the state peace and development council ( spdc ) on november 17 , 1997 .
opposition figures claim that five election laws include provisions that prohibit the candidacy of many opposition leaders , including aung san suu kyi , as well as disenfranchise voters inclined to support opposition parties .
however , burma's ruling military junta , then known as the state law and order restoration council ( slorc ) , refused to accept the election results , claiming that the newly elected parliament could not be convened until a new constitution had been approved .
following the elections , slorc arrested and imprisoned many of the opposition leaders , including nld leader aung san suu kyi .
these regions are locations largely under the control of armed opposition groups with populations generally opposed to the spdc .
campbell also confirmed that the obama administration would continue its current policy of diplomatic engagement with the spdc , but reiterated that sanctions could be added or removed , depending on the actions of the ruling military junta .
in addition , opposition parties do not have a sufficient number of candidates to win a majority of the state or regional parliamentary seats , but could win control in the arakan ( rakhine ) , kachin , mon , and shan states .
there have been repeated allegations that the spdc is using various mechanisms to control the campaign to ensure its victory in the november elections .
however , the decision not to allow portions of these states to participate in the election , as well as continued reports of intimidation in these regions , may indicate that the spdc is trying to insure a usdp victory even in ethnic minority regions .
