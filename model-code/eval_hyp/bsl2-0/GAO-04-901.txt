this report discusses our assessment of the department's capabilities to develop and acquire software and systems , as well as actions faa has under way to improve these capabilities .
we are making recommendations to the secretary of transportation to assist the agency in improving these capabilities .
our work since the mid - 1990s has pinpointed root causes of the modernization program's problems , including ( 1 ) immature software acquisition capabilities , ( 2 ) lack of a complete and enforced system architecture , ( 3 ) inadequate cost estimating and cost accounting practices , ( 4 ) an ineffective investment management process , and ( 5 ) an organizational culture that impaired the acquisition process .
the accompanying report is one in a series of reports responding to your request that we review the information technology management processes that the federal aviation administration ( faa ) uses to manage its air traffic control modernization .
over the past 2 decades , many of the projects that make up the modernization program have experienced substantial cost overruns , schedule delays , and significant performance shortfalls .
now , 2 decades and $35 billion later , faa expects to need another $16 billion through 2007 to complete key projects , for a total cost of $51 billion .
initially , faa estimated that its atc modernization effort would cost $12 billion and could be completed over 10 years .
we have made over 30 recommendations to address these issues , and faa has made substantial progress in addressing them .
our work over the years has documented many of these shortfalls .
as agreed with your staffs , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date on the report .
as a result of these problems , as well as the tremendous cost , complexity , and mission criticality of the modernization program , we designated the program as a high - risk information technology initiative in 1995 , and it has remained on our high - risk list since that time .
at that time , we will send copies of the report to the secretary of transportation , the administrator of the federal aviation administration , and other congressional committees .
nonetheless , in our most recent high - risk report , we noted that more remains to be done â€” and with faa still expecting to spend billions on new atc systems , these actions are as critical as ever .
faa now estimates that it will spend about $51 billion to replace and modernize atc systems through 2007 .
faced with growing air traffic and aging equipment , in 1981 , faa initiated an ambitious effort to modernize its atc system .
this effort involves the acquisition of new surveillance , data processing , navigation , and communications equipment , in addition to new facilities and support equipment .
to accommodate forecasted growth in air traffic and to relieve the problems of aging atc systems , faa embarked on an ambitious atc modernization program in 1981 .
our work over the years has chronicled many faa problems in meeting atc projects' cost , schedule , and performance goals .
