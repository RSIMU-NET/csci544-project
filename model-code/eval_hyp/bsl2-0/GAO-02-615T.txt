my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) the extent of caseload decline since welfare reform was implemented and the status of families who have left welfare , ( 2 ) the extent to which states are spending tanf and moe funds for cash assistance and noncash services and how this compares to welfare spending in fiscal year 1995 , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states are using tanf and moe funds to provide services to low - income families not included in the welfare caseload reported by states to hhs .
it ended the federal entitlement to assistance for eligible needy families with children under aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) and created the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , designed to help needy families reduce their dependence on welfare and move toward economic independence .
the tanf block grant , which is administered by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , makes $16.5 billion available to states each year , regardless of changes in the number of people receiving benefits .
to qualify for their full tanf allotments , states must spend a certain amount of state money , referred to as maintenance - of - effort ( moe ) funds .
the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) significantly changed federal welfare policy for low - income families with children , building upon and expanding state - level reforms .
first , many states have increased spending to engage more welfare families in work or work - related activities and to provide more intensive services for some of these families .
second , many states have increased their efforts to provide services to low - income families not receiving welfare .
this emphasis on work was accompanied by changes in welfare spending , with the focus of welfare spending shifting from monthly cash payments to services , such as child care and transportation to help working families .
to address the second key issue we analyzed information on spending by all 50 states .
in summary , as states implemented work - focused reforms during a period of strong economic growth , cash assistance caseloads dropped by more than 50 percent from 1996 through mid - 2001 .
this shift reflects two key features of reform .
to address the first key issue , we used information from our 1999 review of state studies and more recent studies .
to address the third key issue , we visited 5 states ( california , indiana , pennsylvania , texas , and wisconsin ) and telephoned 20 other states .
services for these families include child care , case management , and job retention and advancement services for families who have recently left welfare for employment and for other low - income working families .
while states have the flexibility under tanf to use their federal and state welfare - related funds to provide services to families not receiving monthly cash assistance , these families are not reflected in caseload data reported by states to hhs .
in addition , some states provide a broad range of services to some low - income families , including family literacy and after school activities and substance abuse prevention services .
