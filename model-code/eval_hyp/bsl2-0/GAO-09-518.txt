in addressing these issues , we assessed the extent to which ( 1 ) dod has effectively managed and overseen drrs acquisition and deployment , and ( 2 ) features of drrs have been implemented and are consistent with legislative requirements and dod guidance .
in september 2008 , the dio projected that it would spend about $135 million through fiscal year 2014 .
recognizing that drrs was not yet fully deployed or operational and in light of our prior work on readiness - related issues , you asked us to review dod's efforts to develop and implement drrs , including the program's status , and the extent that drrs addresses the challenges that led congress to require a new system , such as the availability of information on capabilities , and the precision , timeliness , reliability , and objectivity of readiness metrics .
the dio originally estimated that drrs would achieve full operational capability in fiscal year 2007 , but currently expects drrs to reach full capability in 2014 .
to determine the extent that dod has effectively managed and overseen drrs acquisition and deployment , we analyzed a range of program documentation and interviewed cognizant program and contractor officials relative to the following acquisition management disciplines: requirements development and management , test management , schedule reliability , and human capital .
in june 2002 , the deputy secretary of defense directed the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness ( usd p&r ) to develop , field , maintain , and fund the enhanced status of resources and training system ( esorts ) , which is the automated readiness reporting system within the defense readiness reporting system ( drrs ) .
usd ( p&r ) established a drrs implementation office ( dio ) to manage the system's acquisition , including managing system development and engaging the user community .
the dio has used support contractors to develop the system and reported obligating about $96.5 million for drrs from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2008 .
to determine the extent to which the features of drrs have been implemented and are consistent with legislative requirements and dod guidance , we reviewed criteria such as the legislation that mandated a comprehensive dod readiness reporting system , the dod directive that established drrs , program documentation and usd ( p&r ) guidance memorandums , dio briefings to the readiness community , other departmental instructions , and directives and memorandums related to drrs requirements and implementation .
to assess the ability of u.s. forces to execute the wartime missions for which they were designed , as well as other assigned missions , and to make decisions about deploying forces , the department of defense ( dod ) relies heavily on readiness information derived from multiple information systems .
over the years , we and others have identified shortcomings in dod's readiness assessment and reporting , such as limitations in the completeness and precision of readiness data and a tendency to focus on examining the status of personnel , equipment , and other resources rather than broader capabilities .
congress addressed dod's readiness reporting in the strom thurmond national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1999 by adding section 117 to title 10 of the u.s. code , directing the secretary of defense to establish a comprehensive readiness reporting system to measure , in an “objective , accurate , and timely manner,” the capability of the armed forces to carry out the national security strategy prescribed by the president , the defense planning guidance provided by the secretary of defense , and the national military strategy prescribed by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
