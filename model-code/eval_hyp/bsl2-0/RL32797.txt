the agency most responsible for such issues is the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
in fy2006 , fda operated on a budget of $1.88 billion ( $1.49 billion in appropriated funds and $382 million from user fees ) , more than $6 per u.s. citizen .
earlier that year , the house committee on energy and commerce's subcommittee on oversight and investigations had held hearings because of controversy over the safety of antidepressants when prescribed to children .
concerns about regulatory agencies' abilities to protect the public are not unique to fda or public health .
once a drug has passed that threshold and is fda - approved , fda acts through its postmarket or post - approval regulatory procedures .
there has not been a decade since fda's creation without a highly publicized incident involving drug safety that has led to legislation expanding and strengthening fda's authority to protect the public .
today , as the 110 th congress prepares to consider a variety of health issues , members still share concerns over drug safety and efficacy .
congressional funding for fda has increased at about half the rate as that of industry user fees , established by congress as a way to defray the costs of hiring additional agency personnel so that drug approval review could be quicker .
with that money , fda was expected to oversee about $1 trillion of goods , which make up about one - quarter of all u.s. consumer spending .
in both cases , members were worried that neither the public nor fda were sufficiently informed by manufacturers — or , in the case of fda , sufficiently forthcoming — about risks occurring after the drugs had been first approved .
a few weeks before , merck had notified the food and drug administration ( fda ) that it was withdrawing vioxx from the market in response to recent study results indicating an increased risk of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths among the millions of patients who had been using vioxx since its introduction in 1999 .
this was not the first time that this congress had reacted to news about dangers posed by drugs that had already reached the market .
this report examines issues related to drug safety , specifically in the context of the regulatory process that congress and the fda have established for ensuring that drugs are safe and effective .
even though the user fees account for somewhat less than 20% of the fda total , they made up 59% of fda's center for drug evaluation and research ( cder ) fy2006 budget .
two regulatory frameworks exist for the review of prescription drugs .
a little over two years ago , the senate finance committee convened to hear testimony sparked by concern over the popular merck anti - inflammatory drug vioxx .
it includes a primer on drug approval: how drugs are approved and come to market , including fda's role in that process .
first , fda reviews the safety and effectiveness of new drugs that manufacturers wish to market in the united states ; this process is called premarket approval or preapproval review .
finally , it outlines actions that a variety of analysts have suggested to improve the situation , both ones that fda could adopt on its own and others for which legislation would be necessary .
