dod has increasingly relied on alternative financing arrangements to decrease energy intensity on military installations and to fund energy projects as the agency attempts to implement such projects at a time when constrained budgets have limited the appropriated funding available to meet increasing energy efficiency goals .
we have previously reported on dod's use of alternative financing arrangements for its energy projects .
the house and senate reports accompanying proposed bills for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included provisions for us to review dod energy projects funded with alternative financing arrangements .
these alternative financing arrangements include energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) , utility energy service contracts ( uesc ) , power purchase agreements ( ppa ) , and some forms of enhanced use leases .
to address its power needs , dod has diversified its power sources to include renewable and alternative sources of energy and has reduced its demand for installation energy by investing in efficiency and conservation projects on its installations .
in 2012 , we reported on dod's use of up - front appropriations and alternative financing arrangements for renewable energy projects and recommended that dod issue comprehensive guidance on completing business case analyses of different financing options and improve information - sharing resources , including best practices and lessons learned , on financing such projects .
dod concurred with our recommendations and to date has implemented one of the recommendations by issuing revised guidance on renewable energy projects involving long - term power purchase agreements .
dod generally concurred with the recommendations and has taken steps to implement them .
the department has used alternative financing arrangements in addition to using up - front appropriations to fund a portion of its infrastructure related to renewable energy generation , energy efficiency , power generation , and energy security on military installations .
the department of defense ( dod ) is the largest energy consumer in the federal government , spending $3.9 billion on facilities energy in fiscal year 2015 .
we made eight recommendations , including that dod should clarify guidance for project documentation , such as including information on land values and how projects will help dod meet its energy security objective .
specifically , dod and the military services have issued guidance on developing business case analyses , and dod has established a renewable energy integrated process team where officials from the office of the secretary of defense meet regularly with officials from the military services to discuss dod renewable energy plans and processes .
in addition , in 2016 , we reported that dod used various approaches to analyze the financial costs and benefits of 17 renewable energy projects .
in this report , we ( 1 ) evaluate the extent to which the military services have used alternative financing arrangements to fund energy projects since 2005 and collected and provided dod complete and accurate data on those projects ; ( 2 ) assess the extent to which the military services reported achieving expected savings and verified the reported performance of selected projects ; and ( 3 ) describe the benefits and disadvantages reported by the military services — as well as potential other costs — of using alternative financing arrangements for selected energy projects rather than using up - front appropriations .
