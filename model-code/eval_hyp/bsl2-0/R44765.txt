with an eye on increasing this percentage , india is instituting a number of policy initiatives like the hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy ( help ) and major infrastructure investments such as expanding domestic gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas ( lng ) import terminals .
the united states has expanded technical assistance programs in order to help india meet its carbon emission reduction goals .
india's natural gas demand is forecasted to grow at about 6% annually over the next five years , according to the international energy agency ( iea ) due to increases in domestic production and falling lng import prices .
overall , india imports almost three - quarters of its energy needs , making it highly dependent on other countries .
the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) believes india will remain the fastest - growing g20 economy in 2017-2018 , with an annual projected growth rate of 7.5% .
in 2015 india accounted for 5.3% of global primary energy consumption , while china was the largest consumer with 22.9% .
however , these changes likely will take significant investment and commitment from the indian government to reach fruition .
its population is expected to surpass china as the world's largest by 2022 , reaching approximately 1.4 billion people , creating greater demand for energy .
by 2050 , india has the potential to overtake the united states as the world's second - largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity ( ppp ) .
india is continuing to build its energy infrastructure for natural gas , which had previously been almost exclusively configured for coal and oil , to reverse the recent declines in natural gas consumption .
similarly , natural gas accounts for 6% of china's energy mix , though china uses almost four times as much natural gas as india ( see figure 1 ) .
natural gas makes up 7% of india's total energy consumption , well behind coal and oil .
in 2015 , india's natural gas consumption declined almost 18% since its peak in 2011 , two - thirds of which occurred between 2012 and 2013 , in part because of large drops in domestic production and an inability to compensate for the drop in domestic production with lng imports .
the government of india ( goi ) has indicated it will change this in the short term , but the goi's commitment and resources necessary for these changes are uncertain .
india's relationship with the united states on energy issues , though not significant to the broader energy market , has grown closer in recent years .
for example , the modi administration has loosened offshore exploration regulations , as well as instituted a policy to provide fertilizer plants with subsidies for purchasing natural gas more affordably .
if global natural gas prices continue to be relatively low , natural gas consumption in india will likely grow in the coming decade .
indian energy companies have also signed contracts to import u.s. lng .
the two nations have also pledged to increase their annual trade about five - fold to $500 billion by 2024 .
in 2015 , india was the united states' 10 th - largest trading partner , comprising $39 billion in u.s. exports and $69 billion in u.s. imports .
