they have since incorporated other issues , such as water management practices ( both consumption and discharge ) , land use changes , and induced seismicity , as well as air pollution and greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions associated with natural gas production and transport activities .
these concerns centered initially on water quality issues , including the potential contamination of groundwater and surface water from hydraulic fracturing and related production activities .
however , the recent increase in unconventional natural gas production has raised a new set of questions regarding human health , safety , and environmental impacts .
debate continues as to whether the increased production and use of natural gas brings net benefits to the general economy , including jobs , investments , infrastructure , national security , human health , safety , and the environment .
on the one hand , a shift to natural gas is promoted as climate change mitigation because it has a lower co 2 emissions intensity than either oil or coal ( i.e. , it is commonly stated that natural gas has half the co 2 emissions intensity of coal ) .
many members of congress as well as the obama administration have supported this assessment .
recent reports in the scientific literature and popular press have created some confusion about the ghg emissions profile and the subsequent climate implications of natural gas .
for these reasons , pollution control measures in natural gas systems have traditionally received less attention at the federal level relative to those in other hydrocarbon industries .
on the other hand , methane — the primary constituent of natural gas — is itself a more potent ghg than co 2 per unit of mass , and some contend that methane leakage from the production , transport , and use of natural gas has the potential to offset the ghg emissions benefits of switching .
when used as a fuel , natural gas has several advantages over other hydrocarbons ( e.g. , oil and coal ) .
nor does it attempt to assess the full environmental impacts ( e.g. , inclusive of the net benefits to meeting national ambient air quality standards , reducing emissions of hazardous air pollutants , improving water management and land use practices , among others ) .
further , its combustion emits no mercury ( a persistent , bioaccumulative neurotoxin ) , virtually no particulate matter or sulfur dioxide , and less nitrogen oxides , per unit of combustion , than either oil or coal .
many in both the public and the private sectors have advocated for the increased production and use of natural gas because the resource is domestically available , economically recoverable , and a potential "cost - effective bridge" to a less polluting and lower greenhouse - gas - intensive economy .
to answer these questions , more analysis is necessary along each of these lines of inquiry , as greater clarity would help inform domestic policy choices .
natural gas is cleaner - burning ; it emits less carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) than oil or coal when used to generate electricity in a typical power plant .
recent expansion in natural gas production — primarily the result of new or improved technologies ( e.g. , hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling ) used on unconventional resources ( e.g. , shale , tight sands , and coal - bed methane ) — has made natural gas an increasingly significant component in the u.s. energy market .
