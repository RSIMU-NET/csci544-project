as a result , farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the united states .
it encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops ( such as corn , soybeans , wheat , and cotton ) and livestock and poultry products ( including meat , dairy , and eggs ) , as well as fruits , tree nuts , and vegetables .
the intensity and economic importance of each of these activities , as well as their underlying market structure and production processes , vary regionally based on the agro - climatic setting , market conditions , and other factors .
in addition , u.s. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products , forest products , custom work , machine hire , and other farm - related activities .
annual u.s. net farm income is the single most - watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period ( see box "measuring farm profitability" for a definition of net farm income ) .
the u.s. farm sector is vast and varied .
when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .
inflation - adjusted farm asset values ( using 2019 dollars ) are projected lower in 2020 ( - 0.6% ) .
in the first of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2020 ( see box "ers's annual farm income forecasts" below ) , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) economic research service ( ers ) projects that u.s. net farm income will rise 3.3% year - over - year in 2020 to $96.7 billion , up $3.1 billion from last year ( figure 1 and table a - 1 ) .
since the late 1990s , farm household incomes have surged ahead of average u.s. household incomes ( figure 21 ) .
the february forecast of $96.7 billion is 6.3% above the 10-year average of $89.9 billion ( in nominal dollars ) but is well below 2013's record high of $123.7 billion .
the leveling off of crop land values since 2015 reflects stagnant commodity prices ( figure 18 ) .
about 18% ( $20,926 ) of total farm household income in 2020 is projected to be from farm production activities , while the overwhelming majority , at 82% ( $97,982 ) , is earned off the farm ( including financial investments ) .
total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $425.3 billion in 2020 ( +2.3% ) ( table a - 3 ) .
considerable uncertainty clouds the economic outlook for the sector , reflecting the mixed outlook for prices and market conditions , an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses , and an increasing dependency on federal support to offset lost trade opportunities due to ongoing trade disputes .
