other proposals in congress affecting hydraulic fracturing operations for natural gas production , offshore drilling , or u.s. oil shale development could also affect the u.s. - canada energy trade .
congress has been facing important policy questions in the u.s. - canada energy context on several fronts , including the siting of major cross - border pipelines , increasing petroleum supplies from canadian oil sands , increasing natural gas production from north american shales , and the construction of new facilities for liquefied natural gas ( lng ) exports .
finally , the report discusses possible implications for the u.s. - canada energy relationship going forward , highlighting considerations for congress as it continues its oversight of the energy industry and considers new energy legislation .
the value of the energy trade between the two countries totaled nearly $100 billion in 2010 , helping to promote general economic growth and directly support thousands of energy industry and related jobs on both sides of the border .
although the report raises environmental issues in specific contexts , a broad discussion of environmental impacts from north american energy production and consumption is beyond its scope .
while specific energy policy issues arising in the united states and canada may appear to be independent of one another , many have important physical , economic , and environmental links .
the u.s. - canada energy relationship is increasingly complex , however , and is undergoing fundamental change , particularly in the petroleum and natural gas sectors .
increased energy trade between the united states and canada — a stable , friendly neighbor — is viewed by many as a major contributor to u.s. energy security .
canada is also the primary recipient of u.s. energy exports .
legislative proposals in the 112 th congress could directly influence these developments .
thus , u.s. - canada energy policies established in one context may have important implications in others .
s. 304 would support a program to train workers in the construction , operation , maintenance , and performance of all related environmental processes involving oil and gas infrastructure in alaska .
canada has long been the united states' most important energy partner .
canada is the single largest foreign supplier of petroleum products , natural gas , and electric power to the united states — and the united states is the dominant consumer of canada's energy exports .
it summarizes important trends in both of these sectors and identifies key connections among these trends .
909 would encourage petroleum and natural gas production on the outer continental shelf , would prescribe requirements for coordination with adjacent states regarding associated pipeline construction , and would allow production of petroleum and natural gas from the arctic national wildlife refuge , among other provisions .
this report provides an overview of the u.s. - canada energy trade , with a focus on petroleum and natural gas .
1938 would direct the president to expedite the consideration and approval of the keystone xl pipeline linking canadian oil sands production to refineries in the gulf of mexico .

ultimately , the energy market effects of specific energy policies and projects must be weighed against their broader economic value , energy security implications , and environmental impacts .
