to examine the extent to which agencies are performing analysis to identify ways to better leverage their buying power , we selected six agencies that represent varying levels — high , medium and low — of purchase card spending in fiscal year 2014: the departments of defense ( dod ) , veterans affairs ( va ) , the interior ( interior ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and energy ( energy ) and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
this report addresses the extent to which selected ( 1 ) agencies analyze purchase card data to identify opportunities to leverage buying power agency - wide and ( 2 ) purchase cardholders seek opportunities to achieve cost savings when using purchase cards .
congress requested that we review whether government agencies are effectively leveraging buying power to achieve cost savings when procuring goods and services using purchase cards .
since our 2004 report , the federal government has taken steps to better manage purchase card programs and has begun to focus more on strategic sourcing , which includes a thorough analysis of an organization's spending to support efforts to more effectively acquire goods and services .
further , from a broader perspective , omb issued guidance in 2005 requiring agencies to focus more on strategic sourcing and initiated a government - wide strategic sourcing program for commonly purchased goods and services that aggregates requirements and streamlines processes in order to leverage spending to the maximum extent possible .
in 2009 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) — responsible for government - wide policy on purchase card use — issued a revision to its circular on purchase card program management stating , among other things , that agencies must include purchase card data when performing analysis as part of strategic sourcing initiatives .
in fiscal year 2015 , federal agencies used purchase cards to procure nearly $19 billion of a wide variety of goods such as office supplies and general contractor services .
although the general services administration ( gsa ) maintains contracts with the banks that issue the purchase cards and captures government - wide transaction data , individual agencies decide which bank to use to support its purchase card requirements and are responsible for monitoring the actions of their cardholders as well as issuing agency - specific policies and procedures on the appropriate use of purchase cards .
more recently , congress enacted the government charge card abuse prevention act of 2012 , which , among other things , requires agencies' inspectors general to perform analysis or audits , as necessary , of purchase card transactions to identify categories of purchases in order to aggregate purchases and obtain lower prices .
for these six agencies , we reviewed government - wide and agency - specific policies and regulations and interviewed acquisition and finance personnel to understand what data concerning purchase card transactions are available and the extent to which agencies collect and analyze these data to support strategic sourcing initiatives .
rather than leveraging the government's vast volume of purchases — or buying power — to obtain savings or discounts when making small purchases , we found cardholders often paid higher prices than necessary .
however , we , as well as agencies' inspectors general , have found that purchase card programs may be vulnerable to fraud , waste , and abuse because they lack sufficient internal controls .
