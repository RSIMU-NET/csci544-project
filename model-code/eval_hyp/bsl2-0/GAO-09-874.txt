moreover , state has requested over 700 additional foreign service officer ( fso ) staff in its fiscal year 2010 budget request .
in response to your request , this report discusses ( 1 ) state's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts since 2006 and the effect of any remaining gaps , and ( 2 ) the extent to which state has used incentives to address staffing gaps at hardship posts .
subsequently , we reported in 2006 that state had made progress in addressing overall staffing shortfalls since implementing its diplomatic readiness initiative ( dri ) , which enabled the department to hire and train more than 1,000 employees above attrition from 2002 to 2004 ; however , the initiative did not fully meet its goals and mid - level vacancies remained a problem at critical posts .
to help meet these challenges , the congress authorized additional positions for state in 2008 â€” the first new positions outside the department's consular and worldwide security upgrade programs since 2004 , according to state .
in recent years we have reported on a number of human capital issues facing state , including staffing deficits at hardship posts that negatively impact diplomatic readiness .
we reported in 2002 that state's staffing shortfalls and ineffective assignment system compromised diplomatic readiness at hardship posts .
staff working in such locations often encounter harsh environmental and living conditions that can include inadequate medical facilities , limited opportunities for spousal employment , poor schools , high levels of crime , and severe climate .
the department of state ( state ) has designated roughly two - thirds of its 268 overseas posts as hardship posts .
many hardship posts are of critical importance to u.s. foreign policy objectives and necessitate a full complement of staff with the right skills to carry out the department's priorities .
furthermore , the department faces the continuing challenge of staffing embassy compounds in the conflict zones of iraq and afghanistan .
in addition to the high number of hardship posts state must staff , the number of positions in locations too dangerous for some family members to accompany an officer has grown considerably in recent years , from more than 700 in 2006 to over 900 at the end of fiscal year 2008 .
to address these objectives , we reviewed gao and state office of inspector general ( oig ) reports and analyzed staffing , bidding , and position data .
we also examined surveys conducted by state , analyzed state documents that outline incentives for hardship service , and collected data on participation in and funds expended on hardship incentive programs .
to assess the impact of staffing gaps and state's use of hardship incentives firsthand , we conducted fieldwork in lagos and abuja , nigeria ; shenyang , china ; and riyadh and jeddah , saudi arabia .
despite some progress since we last reported in 2006 , state has continued to face staffing and experience gaps at hardship posts that may compromise its diplomatic readiness .
several factors contribute to gaps at hardship posts , including state's overall staff shortage , which is compounded by the significant personnel demands of iraq and afghanistan , and a mid - level staffing deficit that has been reduced , but not eliminated .
