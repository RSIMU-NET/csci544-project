the goals of the program are to ( 1 ) enhance the security of our citizens and visitors , ( 2 ) facilitate legitimate travel and trade , ( 3 ) ensure the integrity of the u.s. immigration system , and ( 4 ) protect the privacy of our visitors .
since fiscal year 2002 , dhs has been legislatively directed to submit annual expenditure plans for the program , and we have been directed to review these plans and issue reports .
to address program risks , our reports have included 18 recommendations in such areas as system acquisition process controls , economic justification , human capital management , cost estimating , and test management , all of which dhs has agreed to implement .
these reports have , among other things , identified risks that face the department in delivering promised program capabilities and benefits on time and within cost .
visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) is a multibillion - dollar program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) that is intended to record the entry into and exit from the united states of selected individuals , verify their identity , and confirm their compliance with the terms of their admission into and stay in the united states .
because of your continued interest in ensuring that dhs is taking the necessary actions to successfully implement us - visit , you asked us to determine the progress being made in implementing these recommendations .
because of the number and severity of program management challenges that we identified , we concluded that the program was risky .
for example , we reported that the program office did not have the human capital and acquisition process discipline needed to effectively manage the program .
 ( further details on our objective , scope , and methodology are provided in app .
to achieve this objective , we analyzed program plans , reports , and system documentation relative to the intent of each of our recommendations , and we interviewed appropriate dhs and program officials .
dhs agreed to implement all 18 recommendations .
the u.s .
of these 18 , dhs has completely implemented 2 , has partially implemented 11 , and is in the process of implementing another 5 .
these 18 recommendations are aimed at strengthening the program's management effectiveness .
the current status of dhs's implementation of our 18 recommendations on program risks is mixed , but progress in critical areas has been slow .
our work was performed from august 2005 through december 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
i. ) .
of these 24 recommendations , 18 address risks stemming from program management .
for example , over 2 years have passed , and the program office has yet to develop a security plan consistent with federal guidance or to economically justify its investment in system increments .
notwithstanding these limitations in the security plan , the program office has begun to implement aspects of its september 2004 security plan .
as a result of our assessments , we made 24 recommendations aimed at improving both plans and program management , all of which dhs has agreed to implement .
of the 11 that are partially implemented , 7 are about 2 years old , and 4 are about 10 to 19 months old .
