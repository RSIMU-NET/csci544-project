counterterrorism capability .
to promote international peace and security , the united states supports united nations ( un ) peacekeeping operations worldwide .
as of june 30 , 2017 , the united nations had 16 such operations ongoing with a total budget in un fiscal year 2017 of almost $8 billion .
these operations deployed over 100,000 military , police , and civilian personnel from more than 120 contributing countries in un fiscal year 2017 .
this report ( 1 ) compares the reported costs of a specific un operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical , comparable operation implemented by the united states ; ( 2 ) identifies factors that affect cost differences ; and ( 3 ) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of un and u.s. peacekeeping operations .
the department of state authorities act , fiscal year 2017 , includes a provision for gao to compare the costs , strengths , and limitations of un and u.s. peacekeeping operations .
the united states is the single largest financial contributor to these operations , contributing on average approximately 28 percent of total funding annually .
however , un officials acknowledged that the scope of un intelligence capability remains limited .
dod officials told us that a u.s. peacekeeping operation would have the capability to include a counterterrorism component and would not be constrained in the use of force , if needed , in response to terrorist threats .
dod uses this tool to develop cost estimates for all military contingency operations .
for the military portion of the hypothetical u.s. operation , we worked with the department of defense ( dod ) and the institute for defense analyses ( ida ) to develop a cost estimate using ida's contingency operations support tool ( cost estimating tool ) .
in addition , established in 2014 , minusca is one of the most recent un peacekeeping operations ; thus , initial expenditures for the operation are relatively current .
we selected minusca because it is in sub - saharan africa , where most un peacekeeping operations established since 2003 have taken place , and has a typical scope and budget compared to other un peacekeeping operations in sub - saharan africa , according to u.s. and un officials .
un peacekeeping operations , on the other hand , lack the capabilities and specialized military preparation to engage in counterterrorism operations , according to the un high - level panel report .
according to the un report , un peacekeeping operations may engage in proactive and preemptive use of force to protect civilians and un personnel from threats ; however , offensive force to degrade , neutralize or defeat an opponent is a fundamentally different type of posture that should be authorized by the security council only under limited and exceptional circumstances .
u.s. and un officials agreed that u.s. operations would involve superior intelligence capability .
the un only recently established an intelligence policy — in may 2017 — having recognized that some peacekeeping operations had been deployed in fragile political and security environments with asymmetrical and complex threats .
intelligence capability .
we also met with state officials to estimate other costs , including for housing , administrative support , and travel , but did not assess the reliability of these costs provided by state .
