federal agencies plan to spend over $82 billion on information technology ( it ) in fiscal year 2014 .
given the size and magnitude of these investments , it is important that agencies effectively manage the operations and maintenance of existing investments to ensure they ( 1 ) continue to meet agency needs , ( 2 ) deliver value , and ( 3 ) do not unnecessarily duplicate or overlap with other investments .
to do so , our work focused on the 10 federal it investments with the largest reported budgets in o&m and the eight responsible agencies — namely , the departments of defense ( dod ) , energy , homeland security ( dhs ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , the treasury , and veterans affairs ( va ) , and the national aeronautics and space administration and social security administration — that operate these investments .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) directs agencies to periodically examine the performance of these investments against , among other things , established cost , schedule , and performance goals .
o&m investments consist of existing legacy systems ( i.e. , steady state ) and systems that are in both development and o&m ( known as mixed life cycle ) .
as shown in figure 1 , the $59 billion represents a significant majority ( i.e. , 77 percent ) of total budgeted spending for these agencies ( $76 billion ) .
the objectives of our current review were to: identify the federal it o&m investments with the largest budgets , including their responsible agencies and how each investment supports its agency's mission ; determine the extent to which these investments have undergone assess whether the responsible agency's major it investments are in development , mixed life cycle , or steady state and the extent to which funding for investments in o&m have been transferred and used to fund investments in development .
further , of the $76 billion , over $59 billion is to be spent on o&m investments with the remainder ( $17 billion ) being budgeted for development of new capabilities .
of this amount , at least $59 billion was reported by the agencies to be spent on operations and maintenance ( o&m ) .
the president's fiscal year 2014 budget request included plans for the federal government to spend over $82 billion on it .
specifically , omb calls for agencies to perform annual operational analyses ( oa ) , which are a key method for examining the performance of such investments in o&m .
of the $82 billion budgeted for it , the budget provides that 26 key agencies plan to spend the bulk of it , approximately $76 billion .
further , to assess whether each of the eight agency's major it investments are in development , mixed life cycle , or steady state , we analyzed omb budget documentation on the agencies' planned spending on each it investment by phase ( i.e. , development , mixed , or steady state ) .
in addition , we determined how these 10 investments supported their agencies' mission by analyzing omb and agency documentation and conducting interviews with agency officials responsible for these investments .
