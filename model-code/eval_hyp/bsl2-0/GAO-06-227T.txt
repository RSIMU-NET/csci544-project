nsps will not only affect the roughly 700,000 dod civilian employees , but it could have far - reaching implications for civil service reform across the federal government .
the final nsps regulations , if implemented properly , could go a long way in the area of helping to shape such a framework and serve , along with gao's , the department of homeland security's , and other reform efforts , as a potential model for governmentwide reform in the area of human capital management .
human capital reforms to date recognize that the “one - size - fits - all” approach is not appropriate to all agencies' demands , challenges , and missions .
i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide our observations on the department of defense's ( dod ) final national security personnel system ( nsps ) regulations , which the secretary of defense and the director of the office of personnel management ( opm ) published earlier this month .
however , we have reported that a reasonable degree of consistency across the government is desirable and that broader reforms should be guided by a common framework consisting of principles , criteria , and processes .
as i have previously testified , we support moving forward with appropriate human capital reform , but how it is done , when it is done , and the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are successful .
these details do matter and are critical issues that will need to be addressed as dod's efforts in implementing a new personnel system move forward .
consistent with leading practices , the dod final regulations stipulate that the performance management system will , among other things , align individual performance expectations with the department's overall mission and strategic goals , organizational program and policy objectives , annual performance plans , and other measures of performance .
we have reported that individuals inevitably worry during any change management initiative because of uncertainty over new policies and procedures .
in our previous testimony on dod proposed nsps regulations , we testified that the regulations did not detail how dod was to achieve such an alignment .
the final regulations were not modified to provide such details .
dod's final nsps regulations establish a new human resources management system within the department that is intended to ensure its ability to attract , retain , and reward a workforce that is able to meet its critical mission .
as with any major change management initiative , the final regulations have raised a number of concerns among employees , employee representatives , and other stakeholders because they do not contain many of the important details of how the system will be implemented .
close monitoring of any unintended consequences , such as on the mspb and its ability to manage adverse action cases from dod and other federal agencies , is warranted .
further , the human resources management system is to provide dod with greater flexibility in the way employees are to be paid , developed , evaluated , afforded due process , and represented by employee representatives while reflecting the principles of merit and fairness embodied in the statutory merit systems principles .
