japan's highly segmented banking industry is made up of separate groups of institutions engaged in short - term or long - term finance ; trust activities ; foreign exchange , and trade financing ; small business finance ; and regional and agricultural finance .
at that time , as a key part of japan's efforts to promote rapid industrial recovery , the government instituted legal reforms that created pronounced specialization in banking that persists to some degree to the present day .
bank regulation and supervision are the responsibility of the central government , although some financial institutions are under the jurisdiction of local governments .
although the japanese banking industry remains segmented and specialized , deregulation and liberalization since the 1970s have eliminated many functional distinctions among the different types of banks and the separate , specialized markets they formerly served .
historically , the japanese government has established long - term financial institutions to provide long - term funds for agriculture and other industries .
long - term financial institutions in japan include long - term credit banksand trust banks .
the segmentation of the banking industry reflects the extensive restructuring the japanese economy underwent in the aftermath of world war ii .
since deregulation of the banking industry , however , ordinary banks are also making longer - term loans , and the historic differences between ordinary and long - term financial institutions have become less pronounced .
after world war ii , the japanese government's efforts to rebuild the economy led to the dismantling of these prewar conglomerates and to restrictions on universal banking powers that were formerly allowed to banks .
until recently , they have been the only institutions permitted to raise long - term funds .
as part of the nation's postwar economic and industrial recovery reforms , the japanese government restricted banks from engaging in activities outside of banking , such as securities activities , and it limited their ownership of shares in other japanese companies , particularly industrial companies .
long - term credit banks may issue bank debentures with up to 5-year maturities , and trust banks may handle 5-year trust accounts .
industry deregulation initiated in the early 1980s that culminated with the 1992 financial system reform law also now allows banks to compete in securities underwriting activities through subsidiaries , albeit with certain restrictions on those activities .
