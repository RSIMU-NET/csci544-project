specifically , our objective was to assess the extent to which nsf incorporates key contracting practices in the three major phases of the acquisition process: ( a ) acquisition planning , ( b ) contract award , and ( c ) post - award contract monitoring .
our work at several federal agencies has highlighted the importance of sound contracting practices — such as adequate time for planning , sufficient market research , and effective contract monitoring — as critical to a strong foundation for successful acquisition outcomes .
but in recent years , we and others , including the nsf office of the inspector general ( nsf - oig ) , have identified various challenges regarding the contracting practices at nsf , particularly involving the agency's use of cost - type contracts .
much of nsf's acquisition spending involves exploration activities in remote and austere locations throughout the world .
the 11 contracts and orders consisted of 4 contracts for which nsf used the negotiation process set forth in part 15 of the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) and 7 orders under existing contracts , which involved the use of streamlined procedures described in other parts of the far .
the national science foundation ( nsf ) spends more than $400 million annually acquiring the goods and services it needs to carry out its mission to promote science and engineering .
to do so , we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 11 contracts and contract orders with funding obligations of at least $3 million each in fiscal year 2011 , the latest year for which data were available when we began our work .
although all 11 contracts were active during the time of our review , some of the selected contracts were awarded more than 7 years ago — before nsf updated its contracting manual — and some more recently .
we selected contracts and orders to reflect a mix of program offices and a variety of contract types , such as fixed - price and cost - reimbursement .
nsf has taken steps to address nsf - oig recommendations to increase contract oversight .
you requested that we assess nsf's contracting practices .
the sample we used is not generalizable to the universe of all contracts at nsf , but the 11 contracts and orders represent 70 percent of the total dollars obligated by nsf on all its contracts and orders during 2011 .
nsf has a management responsibility to ensure that adequate resources are available to enable contracting officers to determine that costs billed by contractors are allowable , through incurred cost audits or similar assessments .
we selected the key practices based on requirements and principles in the far , practices identified in our prior work , or matters raised in nsf - oig recommendations .
without a process to ensure audits are conducted in cases when nsf - oig resources are not available , nsf exposes itself to unnecessary risk and cannot assure the validity of costs billed .
as more fully described in appendix i , we determined the extent to which each of the contracts and orders in our sample reflected the use of selected key contracting practices .
when an acquisition involves substantial uncertainties and the agency deems a cost - type contract as the most appropriate vehicle , contract and program staff need to provide additional oversight to protect the government's interests .
