in the united states , proposals have been developed to reform the taxation of foreign - source income .
this is about half of the $425 billion of total worldwide income ( foreign plus domestic ) earned by u.s. corporations in that year .
while some research shows that taxes change location incentives , the existing research does not reach definitive conclusions about important economic effects such as the impact of foreign investment by u.s. corporations on u.s. employment .
the proposals differ , with some designed to move the united states toward more territoriality and others intended to maintain a more worldwide approach .
for example , u.s. corporations reported $205 billion in foreign - source income for tax year 2003 , the latest year currently available .
compared to the extensive examination of economic effects , little has been done to study whether there are important differences between worldwide and territorial systems in terms of tax administration and , more specifically , in terms of compliance by taxpayers and taxpayers' compliance burden ( recordkeeping , reporting , and other costs ) .
as technology advances and globalization continues to eliminate barriers to conducting business across countries , companies routinely earn income in several countries .
an extensive body of literature debates the economic merits of these proposals , including the effects of taxes on competitiveness and the location decisions of firms .
foreign - source income , especially when earned by multinational corporations ( mnc ) , presents challenges for income tax design and administration .
the other is ensuring corporations do not erode the domestic tax base by illegally shifting domestic income abroad .
one is ensuring that domestic corporations pay the tax due on foreign - source income .
these challenges include ensuring tax law compliance , minimizing tax induced distortions of businesses decisions about where to locate investment , avoiding the double taxation of income earned in one country by companies located in another country , and minimizing unnecessary taxpayer compliance burden , such as recordkeeping .
under this approach , double taxation is addressed through foreign tax credits ( ftc ) .
basic features of the u.s. tax system result in the ability of some mncs to defer domestic taxation until it is actually paid to a domestic part of the mnc .
in the context of foreign - source income , at least two broad compliance issues exist .
one hallmark of the global economy is greater mobility of income and economic transactions .
based on your request , our objectives are to ( 1 ) describe , for select case study countries that take a territorial approach , what types of foreign - source income the countries exempt and the rules governing those exemptions ; and ( 2 ) describe , to the extent information is available , the compliance risks and taxpayer compliance burdens that the taxation of foreign - source corporate income presents for each of these countries .
most developed countries , especially after recent policy changes in japan and the united kingdom , now lean toward a territorial approach but are not purely territorial — in part , because they place significant limitations on what types of income are eligible for exempt treatment .
to address our objectives , we selected five countries — australia , canada , france , germany , and the netherlands — to study based on several criteria , including range of rules governing the taxation of foreign - source income , unique tax system features , and organization of economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) membership .
