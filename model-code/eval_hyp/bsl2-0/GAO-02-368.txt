the primary title iv programs consist of ( 1 ) pell grants ; ( 2 ) subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans ; and ( 3 ) supplemental educational opportunity grants ( seog ) , perkins loans , and work study aid funded by the federal government and administered by participating higher education institutions , commonly known as campus - based aid .
recently , concerns have been raised about whether gi benefits adequately cover educational costs and whether the receipt of gi benefits affects the amount of other federal financial assistance available to postsecondary students under title iv of the higher education act ( hea ) and the internal revenue code .
given the broad range of federal postsecondary financial aid available to students , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine whether receiving gi benefits affects veterans' eligibility for other federal financial aid and ( 2 ) compare the typical amount of federal financial aid awarded to veteran and nonveteran students based on various student and family characteristics that affect their eligibility for financial aid , including income and whether students were dependent or independent of their parents .
for example , in 1999 , taxpayers claimed an estimated $5.2 billion in hope and lifetime learning tax credits , which allow taxpayers to reduce the amount of taxes owed by receiving a credit for tuition and fees paid .
through title iv , about $46 billion was awarded to students in the form of grants , loans , and work - study programs in the 1999- 2000 academic year .
under the internal revenue code , a variety of provisions are available that are designed to help families pay for college .

title 38 chapter 30 ) , a benefit program that provides a monthly stipend to pay for postsecondary education expenses for veterans and eligible service members .
we asked education to estimate the amount of title iv aid awarded to the following populations: ( 1 ) veteran students ; ( 2 ) nonveteran independent students ; and ( 3 ) nonveteran dependent students who were in their first year of enrollment on a full - time basis at a public 2-year , public 4-year , and private 4-year institution .
over 90 percent of veteran and nonveteran students are enrolled in such institutions .
for our second objective , we used data from two u.s. department of education databases for academic year 1999-2000 to determine the amount of title iv aid awarded to all students .
we did verify education's calculations of estimated pell grant and stafford loan aid awarded .
therefore , we calculated the amount of tax credits for which students or families may be eligible based on a variety of factors , such as family income and amount of grant aid received .
