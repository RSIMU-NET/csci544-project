this has led to long delays in the rule implementation and increased market uncertainty .
but the communications sector as a whole is robust and growing , with overall usage and revenues increasing , many incumbents enjoying record revenues and profits , and many new entrants enjoying rapid revenue gains though they may not yet have attained profitability .
but they also have created certain incentives for market consolidation .
the statutory framework imposes obligations and prohibitions on certain networks and service providers , but also provides privileges and rights .
in some cases , entrants employing new technologies are not subject to the obligations and prohibitions imposed on the incumbents they compete against , but also are denied access to privileges and rights that accrue to those incumbents .
technology - driven market forces are potentially undermining the established business models of many incumbent firms , even as the viability of most new entrants remains uncertain .
members on both sides of the aisle as well as industry stakeholders have suggested that many existing provisions in the communications act of 1934 , as amended , and in the copyright act of 1976 , as amended , need to be updated to address current technological and market circumstances .
while this suggests the need for caution , it should not necessarily be justification for inaction if technology - driven market forces have rendered some existing statutory provisions ineffective or even counterproductive .
these new technologies have driven changes in market structure throughout the communications sector that were not contemplated by the 1996 act .
technological spillovers have allowed for the convergence of previously service - specific networks , creating new competitive entry opportunities .
the telecommunications act of 1996 ( 1996 act ) , the most recent comprehensive revision of that framework , is virtually silent with respect to internet protocol ( ip ) , broadband networks , and online voice , data , and video services .
firms also have used new technologies to attempt to "invent around" statutory obligations or prohibitions , such as retransmission consent and copyright requirements .
it is difficult to predict which business models ultimately will succeed , and therefore it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of proposed statutory changes .
three broad , interrelated policy issues are likely to be prominent in any policy debate over how to update the statutory framework: how to accommodate technological change that already has taken place and , more dynamically , how to make the framework flexible enough to accommodate future technological change ; given that underlying scale economies allow for only a very small number of efficient facilities - based network competitors , how to give those few network providers the incentive to invest and innovate while also constraining their ability to impede downstream competition from independent service providers who must use their networks ; and given that spectrum is an essential communications input , how to implement a framework that fosters efficient spectrum use and management .
frequently , their decisions have led to litigation , requiring the courts to rule with limited guidance from the statutes .
congress will be addressing these three broad questions during a time of great market uncertainty .
the expert agencies charged with implementing the relevant statutes — the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and the copyright office — have had to determine if and how to apply the law to technologies and circumstances that were not considered by congress .
