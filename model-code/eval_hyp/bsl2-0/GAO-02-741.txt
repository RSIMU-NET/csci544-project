as requested , we assessed ( 1 ) whether treasury had a statutory veto over the use of ex - im bank's tied aid capital projects fund , ( 2 ) what the principles were for using tied aid , and ( 3 ) how ex - im bank and treasury applied these principles .
while the two agencies instituted formal consultation procedures in july 2001 to prevent future breakdowns in the interagency decision - making process , these new procedures did not address the issue of whether treasury had statutory veto authority over the use of tied aid .
in consultation with the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , ex - im bank assesses applications from u.s. exporters for tied aid financing to counter foreign offers .
the dispute over the handling of the two cases and the extent of treasury's authority over the tied aid program was highlighted in congressional hearings on reauthorization of ex - im bank during may and june 2001 .
through the tied aid capital projects fund , known as the war chest , ex - im bank may provide tied aid financing to support the negotiations and policing of oecd tied aid rules and to match foreign tied aid offers to level the playing field for u.s. exporters .
the provision of tied aid is subject to a nonbinding organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) arrangement , to which the united states is a party , that sets rules restricting the instances in which such offers can be made .
you expressed concern about the nature of treasury's authority over the use of tied aid and the underlying reasons for ex - im bank and treasury's differences .
tied aid is government - to - government concessional financing of public sector capital projects in developing countries that is linked to the procurement of goods and services from the donor country .
in march 2001 , the interagency decision - making process for determining the eligibility of applications for tied aid financing broke down when ex - im bank and treasury disagreed on two applications and treasury “vetoed” them.while ex - im bank and treasury at the time agreed that treasury had the authority to veto these applications , ex - im bank changed its position in june 2001 and challenged treasury's veto authority .
the export - import bank ( ex - im bank ) provides assistance to u.s. exporters facing foreign competitors supported by tied aid .
tied aid can distort trade when it is used to influence competitions for foreign government procurement rather than allowing those procurements to be decided on the basis of quality , price , or service .
to determine whether treasury had a statutory veto over the use of the tied aid funds , we examined the program legislation in effect at the time of the disagreement , legislative history , and relevant ex - im bank and treasury memorandums .
to identify the principles governing the use of tied aid , we examined agency records related to the tied aid policy and decision - making principles , and we interviewed agency officials .
to assess how the principles for tied aid financing were applied , we examined eight tied aid applications , including the two applications that led to the march 2001 disagreement .
