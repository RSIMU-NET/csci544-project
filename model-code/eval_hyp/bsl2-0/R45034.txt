phtk may have to rely on alliances to enact legislation and fulfill its policy agenda .
among the challenges the new president faces are ongoing recovery from the 2010 earthquake and 2016's hurricane matthew , a cholera epidemic , stalled economic growth , and a highly polarized political climate .
eventually , the provisional electoral council ( cep ) scheduled new presidential elections and some legislative contests for october 9 , 2016 .
other obstacles moïse faces during his five - year term include a weak mandate due to low voter turnout , and the possibility of social unrest due to continued poverty and lack of job opportunities .
the government took a step toward funding these objectives in may by ending government fuel subsidies , thereby increasing fuel prices by 20% , but freeing up resources for other programs .
runoff elections for some parliamentary and local elections were completed on january 29 , 2017 .
as a political newcomer , this might prove challenging for moïse to sustain , but he has had some success so far .
meanwhile , privert's term expired on june 14 , 2016 , and the haitian legislature repeatedly did not vote on extending his mandate or appointing another provisional president .
in september 2017 , the legislature approved the president's budget , which included several tax increases for revenue generation .
authorities announced they will initially focus on reviving the agricultural sector , rolling out a comprehensive national health care insurance system , bringing alternative energy to haiti , and infrastructure repair .
although phtk has the most seats of any party in the legislature , with 31 of 119 in the chamber of deputies and 11 of 30 in the senate , no single party has a majority .
some international observers disagreed with the need to rehold the presidential election but acknowledged a potential political need to rehold the election due to public perceptions of its legitimacy .
the united nations ended its 13-year - long united nations stabilization mission in haiti ( minustah ) in october 2017 .
that vote was delayed until november 20 when hurricane matthew devastated parts of haiti on october 3-4 .
voter turnout was 21% .
the public greeted these tax increases with violent street protests , however .
moïse arrived under the shadow of an ongoing haitian government investigation into his possible involvement in money laundering and irregular loan arrangements , which moïse denies .
the elections were held , and on january 3 , 2017 , haiti's electoral council declared political novice jovenel moïse the winner of the presidential elections .
other items on the policy agenda include redeveloping the capital , port - au - prince , including the presidential palace and other government buildings that were destroyed during the 2010 earthquake .
the legislature then approved the policy agenda presented by lafontant .
moïse , a political newcomer and member of the bald head party ( phtk , former president michel martelly's [2011-2016] party ) , won the november 2016 elections with almost 56% of the vote .
haiti inaugurated jovenel moïse as president on february 7 , 2017 , marking a return to constitutional order .
a new , smaller mission , the united nations mission for justice support in haiti ( minujusth ) , succeeded it , and will focus on strengthening judicial institutions and protecting human rights .
