to this end , our government has in part reorganized by combining vital federal security , immigration , and investigative capabilities within a new department of homeland security ( dhs ) .
 ( 4 ) what are the major strategic challenges facing congress , dhs , and other federal agencies as the post - 9 / 11 era progresses and decisions are made about prioritizing efforts and allocating finite resources to further enhance homeland security ? .
it is also important to review security efforts made to date , in light of congress' interest in revisiting the recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission , including those addressing aviation and border security challenges , as well as challenges related to sharing homeland security information .
 ( 3 ) how have federal border security efforts evolved since 9 / 11 to reduce the likelihood that terrorists could enter the united states through legal checkpoints ? .
as the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( the 9 / 11 commission ) noted in its 2004 report , none of the security measures adopted by the u.s. government prior to the attacks disturbed or even delayed the progress of the al qaeda plot .
since 9 / 11 , congress and the administration , including many federal agencies , have increasingly sought to take a longer - term view of homeland security , recognizing , among other things , that a variety of transportation and border security initiatives are needed , such as improving the mechanisms for screening foreign travelers before they enter the country legally by air , land , or sea ports , and tracking their entry and exit .
clearly , federal action was needed to address these and other weaknesses in our defenses .
more recent efforts by terrorists to disrupt society — notably , the alleged attempt by terrorists to bring liquid explosives on board aircraft bound for the united states and terrorist attacks on passenger rail systems in madrid and london — have further highlighted the need for effective information sharing , proactive planning , and effective risk analysis , in order to identify and mitigate risks to people , national assets , and economic sectors and prioritize resources to address them .
while we recognize that it will never be possible to anticipate or mitigate every potential security threat , or to close every gap in our defenses , it is nonetheless important to acknowledge the critical work that has been done to make the country safer — and , looking ahead , to discuss how the government intends to identify , manage , and mitigate risks to domestic security in general , while continuing to protect privacy and the flow of people and commerce .
in recognition of the fifth anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks , you expressed interest in taking stock of some of the efforts by congress , the administration , and many federal agencies — in concert with state and local governments and the private sector — to identify the nation's security vulnerabilities in key areas and find ways to mitigate them to the fullest extent possible .
in the 5 years since 19 hijackers commandeered four commercial aircraft and succeeded in destroying the world trade center , damaging the pentagon , and killing almost 3,000 people , congress and the administration have taken a number of actions to realign homeland security policies , priorities , and resources to help ensure that the 9 / 11 scenario could never be repeated .
