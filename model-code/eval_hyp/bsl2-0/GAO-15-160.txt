u.s. agencies responsible for the monitoring and implementation of labor provisions in the ftas in many cases engaged in only minimal oversight and assistance with fta partner countries to address these challenges .
in some instances , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) supports partner countries in implementing fta labor obligations and initiatives by administering technical assistance projects , carried out by usaid's implementing partners .
we recommended that the department of labor ( dol ) , in consultation with other agencies , initiate regular contact with all fta partners' ministries of labor to review implementation of fta labor provisions and to develop ongoing priorities and plans for technical cooperation on labor matters .
the effective implementation of labor provisions is also relevant as congress considers renewal of the president's lapsed trade promotion authority , most recently in effect from 2002 through 2007 .
ftas phase out barriers to trade with particular countries or groups of countries and contain rules and other commitments to improve access for services and investment .
ftas represent a major component of u.s. trade policy , as the united states has signed 14 ftas with 20 countries covering , according to the department of commerce , more than 35 percent of all u.s. imports — $2.3 trillion in 2013 .
in 2009 , we reported significant challenges connected with the enforcement of labor provisions in four ftas .
we also recommended that the office of the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) , in cooperation with other agencies , prepare updated plans to implement , enforce , monitor , and report on compliance with and progress under the ftas' labor provisions and that these plans should reflect ongoing trade developments , be provided to congress , and be summarized in ustr's annual trade agreements report .
in 2009 , ustr announced that it would take steps jointly with dol and state to improve interagency cooperation ; proactively monitor the implementation of labor provisions ; and address identified problem areas , including foreign practices that would constitute violations of fta requirements .
the status of the implementation of fta labor provisions is of particular relevance , as the united states is negotiating the trans - pacific partnership — a trade agreement with 11 pacific rim countries , in which the administration is seeking to negotiate high - standard labor provisions .
in 2012 , both agencies were taking actions to address the recommendations .
gao , international trade: four free trade agreements gao reviewed have resulted in commercial benefits , but challenges on labor and environment remain , gao - 09-439 ( washington , d.c.: july 10 , 2009 ) .
appendix iii describes u.s. agencies' efforts to monitor implementation of other labor initiatives .
for our review , we selected four ftas — the dominican republic - central america - united states free trade agreement ( cafta - dr ) , the united states - colombia trade promotion agreement ( colombia fta ) , the united states - oman free trade agreement ( oman fta ) , and the united states - peru trade promotion agreement ( peru fta ) .
furthermore , the president's 2014 trade policy agenda indicates that the administration will focus on implementation of the numerous agreements into which the united states has entered and that the united states will work with key trading partners around the world to address specific labor issues .
