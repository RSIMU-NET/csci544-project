these grants are special education grants to states ( school - age grants ) , special education preschool grants ( preschool grants ) and special education grants for infants and families with disabilities ( infant grants ) .
 ( 4 ) what opportunities exist for better coordination among the programs or consolidation of the programs to achieve efficiencies ? .
in fiscal year 2001 , the federal government spent about $7 billion on three special education grant programs mandated by the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) .
 ( 3 ) what is known about the effectiveness of these programs and of the early interventions they fund ? .
instead , the programs serve as funding streams , merging with much greater state and local resources to support state and local programs .
state and local programs supported by the three grants served approximately 6.6 million children in fiscal year 2001 .
specifically , you asked us: ( 1 ) how similar are the goals / objectives , performance measures , eligibility criteria , and the services allowed by these programs ? .
of these children , about 830,000 were receiving early intervention and special education and related services — 231,000 were under 3 years - old and 599,000 were age 3 through 5 .
our work has shown that if such programs are designed to achieve similar outcomes for the same target group and are not well - coordinated , the potential exists for ineffective service delivery and administrative inefficiencies .
to answer these questions , we reviewed pertinent documents , including state monitoring reports issued by the u.s. department of education's ( education ) office of special education programs ( osep ) , which provided detailed information about state and local efforts to implement idea .
 ( 2 ) do states and local agencies receive funding from more than one of these grants and , if so , do they use the funds to provide the same range of services to children in the same age group ? .
this potential exists for school - age grants and preschool grants because school - age grants serve children ages 3 through 21 and preschool grants serve children ages 3 through 5 .
education has addressed known transition problems by requiring these states to develop and implement corrective action plans that will bring them into compliance with idea .
these three grant programs are not programs in the typical sense because they do not carry out a distinct set of functions through their own delivery systems .
this review is one of four reports you have requested looking at overlap among early childhood education and care programs .
we examined the grant application process and administrative structure for each grant program , conducted interviews with special education program officials and representatives from special education stakeholder groups ( parents and state directors of special education ) , conducted comprehensive state - level interviews in four states — maine , minnesota , ohio , and virginia — and conducted structured telephone interviews with officials from 15 states .
the department of education has recognized that there is some potential for a gap in services for 3 year - olds as they move from programs funded by infants grants into preschool programs and requires that states and local agencies minimize these service gaps by following federal requirements for program coordination and transition planning .
