dod's declining budgets and the impact of sequestration have lent additional impetus to reduce the costs of weapons .
the cost growth of dod's 2013 portfolio of weapon systems is about $448 billion and schedule delays average more than 2 years .
over the past 50 years , congress and dod have explored ways to improve acquisition outcomes , including actions like the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 and the department of defense's ( dod's ) own recent “better buying power” initiatives .
these and other reforms have championed sound management practices , such as realistic cost estimating , prototyping , and systems engineering .
today , i will ( 1 ) provide summary cost and schedule information on dod's portfolio of major weapon systems ; ( 2 ) describe the policies and processes in place to guide those acquisitions ; ( 3 ) discuss incentives to deviate from otherwise sound acquisition practices ; and ( 4 ) suggest ways to temper these incentives .
weapon systems acquisition has been on gao's high risk list since 1990 .
while some progress has been made on this front , too often we report on the same kinds of problems today that we did over 20 years ago .
to get better results the focus should not be on adding to or discarding acquisition policies , but instead on the incentives that work against them .
this statement draws from our extensive body of work on dod's acquisition of weapon systems and the numerous recommendations we have made both on individual weapons and systemic improvements to the acquisition process .
as one can see , cost and schedule growth for dod's aggregate portfolio remain significant .
a number of these programs have improved their buying power by finding efficiencies .
for example , when measured against programs' first full estimates , the total cost of the portfolio has increased by nearly $448 billion with an average delay of 28 months in initial operating capability .
for example , 50 of the 80 programs in the portfolio reduced their total acquisition costs over the past year .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss weapon system acquisitions and where reform should focus next .
while these modest improvements are encouraging , the enormity of the investment in acquisitions of weapon systems and its role in making u.s. fighting forces capable , warrant continued attention and reform .
as seen in table 1 , the value of these investments in recent years has been on the order of $1.5 trillion or more , making them a significant part of the federal discretionary budget .
also , as indicated in table 1 , 42 percent of programs have had unit cost growth of 25 percent or more .
on the other hand , we have recently seen some modest improvements in a large number of programs .
the work on which this testimony is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
we have made a number of recommendations on how dod can improve implementation of the weapon systems acquisition reform act .
