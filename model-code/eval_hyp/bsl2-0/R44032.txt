the 113 th congress considered additional patent system reforms , including the innovation act .
regulatory exclusivities apply to drugs and biologic medicines regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
the 112 th congress made significant changes to the patent system through the leahy - smith america invents act ( aia ) .
legislation considered by previous sessions of congress , the moddern cures act , would have extended this paradigm .
recent laws have increased the term of regulatory exclusivities to periods that begin to rival those of patents .
both patents and regulatory exclusivities have been the subject of congressional interest in recent years .
the innovation act passed the house of representatives in the 113 th congress and has been introduced in the 114 th congress in virtually identical form .
the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 created a 12-year regulatory exclusivity , and under the generating antibiotics incentives now ( gain ) act a "qualified infectious disease product" that consists of a new chemical entity enjoys an exclusivity period of 10 years .
federal legislation establishes a complex range of regulatory exclusivities applicable to , among other subjects , new chemical entities , orphan drugs , and generic drugs .
that unenacted legislation would have effectively allowed brand - name pharmaceutical firms , in certain circumstances , to exchange their patents for a 15-year period of regulatory exclusivity .
as well , the 111 th and 112 th congresses created new forms of regulatory exclusivity for biologic medicines and qualified infectious disease products , respectively .
the patent system has traditionally served as the primary innovation incentive for new medicines .
contemporary legislative trends may elevate the regulatory exclusivity from a supplemental protection scheme to the primary driver of innovation within the pharmaceutical industry .
for the past three decades , regulatory exclusivities have served alongside patents as a parallel , shorter - term exclusion mechanism for the vast majority of innovative pharmaceuticals .
starting with the orphan drug act , congress has also developed a new form of intellectual property right in order to promote the marketing of new drugs .
this report reviews the evolving nature of patents and regulatory exclusivities within the pharmaceutical industry .
patents , which are administered by the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , allow for a uniform 20-year term of protection for a variety of inventions .
in general , these intellectual property rights require the fda to protect an approved drug from competing applications for a set period of time .
these proposals have been placed before the 114 th congress in the form of a discussion draft of the 21 st century cures act .
it begins by introducing the patent system , with emphasis upon its application to the pharmaceutical industry .
it then reviews the moddern cures act and the innovation act , legislation that appears to continue a trend towards distinct treatment of pharmaceuticals as subjects of intellectual property .
this report next discusses the growing number of fda - administered regulatory exclusivities and compares them to the patent right .
patents issued by the uspto provide their owners with the right to exclude others from practicing the invention or importing it into the united states .
