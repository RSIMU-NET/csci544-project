at least 15 states already have some form of chemical disclosure requirements .
1084 and s. 587 , the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act ( frac act ) , would have created more broadly applicable disclosure requirements for parties engaged in hydraulic fracturing .
the shale gas production subcommittee of the secretary of energy advisory board has made several recommendations intended to address these effects .
these provisions vary widely , but generally indicate ( 1 ) which parties must disclose information about chemical additives and whether these disclosures must be made to the public or a state agency ; ( 2 ) what information about chemicals added to a fracturing fluid must be disclosed , including how specifically parties must describe the chemical makeup of the fracturing fluid and the additives that are combined with it ; ( 3 ) what protections , if any , will be given to trade secrets ; and ( 4 ) at what time disclosure must be made in relation to when fracturing takes place .
in 2011 , president barack obama directed secretary of energy steven chu to form a panel to study the effects of shale gas production on health and the environment .
at the state level , the interstate oil and gas compact commission , an organization with members that include state regulators and industry representatives , has argued that current regulation of hydraulic fracturing by the states is sufficient .
others states are in the process of considering disclosure laws or regulations .
although some of these chemical additives may be harmless , others may be hazardous to health and the environment .
proponents of chemical disclosure laws maintain that public disclosure of the chemicals used in each well would allow for health professionals to better respond to medical emergencies involving human exposure to the chemicals ; assist researchers in conducting health studies on shale gas production ; and permit regulators and others to perform baseline testing of water sources to track potential groundwater contamination if it occurs .
a report by the minority staff of the house committee on energy and commerce found that between 2005 and 2009 , the 14 leading oil and gas service companies used "780 million gallons of hydraulic fracturing products" in fracturing fluids , with "95 of the products containing 13 different carcinogens. .
however , some manufacturers of the additives , as well as others in the industry , remain reluctant to disclose information about the chemicals they use .
these parties have expressed concerns that disclosure would reveal proprietary chemical formulas to their competitors , destroying the parties' valuable trade secrets .
this report provides an overview of current and proposed laws and regulations at the state and federal levels that require the disclosure of the chemicals added to the fluid used in hydraulic fracturing .
in addition , there were legislative efforts in the 112 th congress .
in his 2012 state of the union address , president barack obama said he would obligate "all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use," citing health and safety concerns .
in may 2012 , the bureau of land management ( blm ) published a proposed rule that would require disclosure of the content of fracturing fluids used on lands managed by the agency .
