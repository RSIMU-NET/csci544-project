since then , no comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced , but beginning in the 106 th congress , a number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues in the law have been enacted — especially , legislation to reauthorize several existing cwa programs .
in the 104 th congress ( 1995 ) , the house passed a comprehensive reauthorization bill that was opposed by the clinton administration and environmental groups ; it was not enacted .
since the 107 th congress , one of the dominant cwa issues has been water infrastructure financing — that is , extension and modification of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects .
criticism has come from industry , which has been the long - standing focus of the act's regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and costly requirements .
initially following enactment of amendments in 1987 , no major cwa legislative activity occurred .
house and senate committees have approved bills and the house passed bills in the 110 th and 111 th congresses , but none has been enacted .
states and cities have traditionally supported water quality programs and federal funding to assist them in carrying out the law , but many have opposed cwa measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates .
criticism also has come from developers and property rights groups who contend that federal regulations ( particularly the act's wetlands permit program ) are a costly intrusion on private land - use decisions .
none of these programs has lapsed , however , as congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement them .
the clean water act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals , which have been widely supported by the public , but lately some have questioned whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth the costs .
many environmental groups believe that further fine - tuning is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems .
it concludes with a discussion of water quality appropriations and water infrastructure as part of economic stimulus legislation in 2009 .
although those goals have not been fully achieved , considerable progress has been made , especially in controlling conventional pollutants ( suspended solids , bacteria , and oxygen - consuming materials ) discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants .
epa , states , industry , and other citizens continue to implement the 1987 legislation , including meeting the numerous requirements and deadlines in it .
programs at the federal level are administered by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) ; state and local governments have major day - to - day responsibilities to implement cwa programs through standard - setting , permitting , enforcement , and administering financial assistance programs .
authorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in fy1994 .
these amendments culminated six years of congressional efforts to extend and revise the act and were the most comprehensive amendments since 1972 .
it consists of two major parts: regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringent requirements on industries and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants ; and provisions that authorize federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction .
