one notable change is increased generation from variable renewable energy ( vre ) sources such as wind and solar .
these standards are developed by the north american electric reliability corporation ( nerc ) and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) in the united states .
congress required the setting and enforcement of electric reliability standards in the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact05 ; p.l .
according to the u.s. energy information administration ( eia ) , combined generation from wind and solar sources increased from 1% of total electricity generation in 2008 to 9% of total electricity generation in 2018 .
109-58 ) .
economic factors , new technologies , environmental concerns and associated regulatory policies , and other developments are changing the energy sources used to generate electricity in the united states .
further adjustments are being discussed as generation from wind and solar sources continue to grow .
power system operators have adjusted existing reliability standards and planning practices to accommodate weather - dependent wind and solar sources .
small - scale generators ( e.g. , rooftop solar electricity generation ) , publicly owned utilities , and local electricity distribution systems are generally under the jurisdiction of state public utility regulatory commissions ( pucs ) .
in contrast , conventional sources for electricity generation , such as coal , natural gas , or nuclear energy , are usually available under normal weather conditions .
these sources have weather - dependent availability , meaning that changing weather patterns can change available electricity supply from those sources .
members of congress might consider how reliability could be impacted if generation from wind and solar sources increases , as many analysts expect .
these mandatory standards apply to the bulk power system , which is comprised mostly of large - scale generators and electricity transmission systems .
questions remain about how higher levels of generation from wind and solar sources might impact electric reliability moving forward .
other reliability concerns , such as cyber and physical security , small - scale generators , and local distribution networks , may be of interest to congress but are not discussed at length in this report .
nerc's 2018 annual report on reliability showed that , of the 13 metrics it uses to assess reliability , 9 were stable or improving over the 2013-2017 period and 4 showed trends that were , at least partly , inconclusive .
to date , generation from wind and solar sources does not appear to be causing electric reliability issues at the national level .
this report provides background on reliability planning in the united states with an emphasis on the effects of daily and seasonal variability in wind and solar sources on the bulk power system .
of the four metrics with inconclusive trends , three improved over this period for a subset of bulk power system components .
data from nerc also indicate that reliability performance is currently stable in regions such as the midwest and california where the shares of generation from wind and solar sources are above the national average .
generally , factors that increase uncertainty reduce reliability , and factors that reduce uncertainty increase reliability .
congress could consider expanding federal activities affecting distribution system reliability .
