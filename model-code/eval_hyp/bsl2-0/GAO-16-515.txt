in fiscal year 2015 , approximately 87 percent of these cases were resolved within 30 days , while the remaining 13 percent — or more than 84,000 people — became long - term missing persons cases .
access to the system is limited to agencies that have authorization under federal law and have applied for access .
the two primary databases are the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) national crime information center ( ncic ) and the national missing and unidentified persons system ( namus ) , which is funded and overseen by doj's national institute of justice ( nij ) .
multiple federal databases supported by doj contain information related to missing persons and unidentified remains ( referred to in this report as missing and unidentified persons ) that can be used to assist law enforcement in resolving these cases .
senate report 113-181 ( accompanying the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 ) includes a provision for us to review national databases containing information reported on missing persons and unidentified human remains , including ncic and namus .
additionally , as 2007 department of justice ( doj ) estimates suggest , there are more than 40,000 sets of unidentified human remains in medical examiner or coroner offices , with several hundred new cases reported each year .
in addition , there are no federal requirements to report an unidentified person's remains ( child or adult ) to either database .
federal law requires that law enforcement agencies ( lea ) enter required information about missing children , defined as individuals under the age of 21 , into ncic within 2 hours of receiving it — called the 2-hour entry rule .
ncic and namus both collect data for authorized users to solve long - term missing and unidentified persons cases .
further , there are no federal requirements associated with reporting information on missing adults to either database because adults have the legal right to go missing in most cases .
these requirements do not apply to namus , though namus does contain information about missing children .
for example , an adult may choose to go missing to seek protection from a domestic abuser .
we assessed this information against standards for internal control in the federal government and gao's evaluation and management guide for fragmentation , overlap , and duplication .
responsibility for entering and managing the data contained in ncic is shared between the fbi and federal , state , local , and tribal criminal justice users .
hundreds of thousands of people across the country are reported missing each year .
we also reviewed laws , policies , and information associated with reporting and sharing information on missing and unidentified persons , to include information about the types of users that can access or enter information into each system within three categories: ( 1 ) lea , ( 2 ) non - lea criminal justice agency ( cja ) — such as a court ; and ( 3 ) medicolegal investigator — such as coroners and forensic analysts .
as a result , not all information on missing and unidentified persons may necessarily be reported to one or both databases .
additional details and limitations related to how we adjusted for these differences , as well as steps taken to assess ncic and namus data reliability can be found in appendix i .
