accordingly,the department of defense ( dod ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , whichis the department of energy ( doe ) agency in charge of the u.s. nuclear weapons program,requested funds to study the robust nuclear earth penetrator ( rnep ) .
rnep has been the most controversial nuclear weapon program in congress for the past fewyears .
supporters argue that it is needed to attack hard and deeply buried targets ( such as leadershipbunkers or wmd production facilities ) in countries of concern , thereby deterring or defeatingchallenges from such nations ; critics assert that rnep would lower the threshold for use of nuclearweapons and prompt other nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter u.s. attack .
 ( 3 ) the plan was thatthe rnep study would cost $15 million a year for fy2003-fy2005 .
congress reduced the fy2004appropriation to $7.5 million .
the senate tabled an amendment by senator dorgan and another by senatorfeinstein to bar funds for rnep , and adopted an amendment by senator nelson ( fl ) , and a similaramendment by senator reed , to require congressional authorization to start development engineering ( discussed below ) or later phases of rnep .
the air force has been leading the study , which startedin may 2003 , with nnsa in charge of studying modifications of specific warheads .
surface - burst nuclear weapons would havelimited effectiveness against deeply buried facilities .
while congress appropriatedthe fy2003 request of $15.0 million , the fy2004 request met much criticism .
for fy2005 , congress eliminatedrnep funding .
 ( 2 ) the administration proposes rnep as a study of modificationsto convert existing b83 nuclear bombs to an earth penetrator configuration .
 ( the nelson amendment became section 3117 of p.l.108-136 , the fy2004 national defense authorization act. ) .
conventional weapons are unable to destroy many such facilities , though opinions differ onwhether nonnuclear means can disable or isolate them .
the appropriation was$4.0 million for dod to conduct the sled test .
to address some technical issues that have arisen in the rnep debates , the bob stumpnational defense authorization act for fy2003 , p.l .
the house rejectedan amendment by representative tauscher to transfer funds from rnep to conventional means ofattacking buried targets .
 ( 5 ) this report discusses the history of rnep in congress and the administration for thefy2005 and fy2006 budget cycles .
in contrast , a nuclear weapon that burrows intothe ground a few meters before detonating would be more effective because it would transfer muchmore of its energy into the ground .
it is nothing more and nothingless. .
the report , released in april 2005 , had nine key conclusions: ( 1 ) many high - value buriedfacilities can be held at risk by nuclear but not conventional epws ; ( 2 ) penetration to a depth of 3meters captures most effects of epws on buried targets ; deeper penetration puts the weapon atgreater risk ; ( 3 ) epws cannot penetrate deeply enough to contain nuclear weapon effects fully ; ( 4 ) casualties from a nuclear weapon burst at shallow depth or on the surface are essentially the same ; ( 5 ) detonating a nuclear weapon at shallow depth increases the energy transmitted to a buried target,permitting a reduction in yield by a factor of 15 to 25 ; ( 6 ) attacks using nuclear epws near urbanareas could produce thousands to over a million casualties , or hundreds to several hundred thousandfor attacks in rural areas ; ( 7 ) a nuclear epw could reduce civilian casualties in an urban area by afactor of 2 to 10 compared to a surface - burst weapon with 25 times the yield ; ( 8 ) a nuclear weaponwould have to detonate within a chamber where chemical or biological agents were stored to destroythe agents ; the same is true of nonnuclear "thermobaric" bombs , which generate high heat andpressure ; and ( 9 ) in a nuclear attack on a chemical weapon facility , nuclear effects would probablykill many more civilians than would the released chemical agent , while a nuclear attack on abiological facility could kill similar numbers of civilians from nuclear effects and released biologicalagents , depending on weapon yield and amount of agent .
