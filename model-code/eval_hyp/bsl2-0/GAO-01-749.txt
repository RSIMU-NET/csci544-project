increasingly , state medicaid programs are contracting with such plans to provide medicaid - covered services , including epsdt .
an additional area of concern has been how these services are faring under managed care plans .
to better understand federal and state efforts to ensure that children in medicaid receive epsdt services , you asked that we examine: 1. the extent to which children in medicaid are receiving epsdt services ; 2. efforts that selected states are taking to improve delivery of epsdt services , particularly within managed care ; and 3. federal government efforts to ensure that state medicaid programs provide covered epsdt services .
to assess the extent to which epsdt services were being provided , we reviewed state reports submitted to the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) , the agency that administers medicaid at the federal level .
these lawsuits have alleged that state medicaid programs are not doing an adequate job of screening children for medical conditions or providing treatment for the children who need it .
this restriction in choice — together with concerns that the prepayment of capitated fees may create incentives for health care providers to under - provide services to maximize profit — has raised awareness of the need for assurance that managed care plans provide required epsdt services .
in addition , the adequacy of state efforts to ensure children's access to these services has been challenged in court cases throughout the country .
this service , called early and periodic screening , diagnostic , and treatment ( epsdt ) , calls for states to provide children and adolescents under age 21 with access to comprehensive , periodic evaluations of health , developmental , and nutritional status , as well as vision , hearing , and dental services .
in many cases , states pay these plans a prepaid fee per medicaid enrollee ( a “capitated” fee ) to provide most medical services .
managed care plans have traditionally placed an emphasis on preventive care as a way to provide appropriate care in the most efficient setting , to avoid or correct health problems before they become more acute or costly .
medicaid , a joint federal and state program , finances health coverage for 21 million , or more than one in four , of the nation's children .
for many years , one of its central services has been to screen children for various conditions so that health problems can be found early and treated before they worsen .
despite the importance of these services , there is concern that families are not sufficiently informed of benefits and that enrolled children are not receiving them .
to implement schip , states have the option of expanding their medicaid programs , developing separate schip programs , or doing some combination of both .
for more than 30 years , federal law has provided comprehensive health coverage for low - income children through medicaid .
we also reviewed major reports and studies on the provision of epsdt services .
however , medicaid beneficiaries in some arrangements are “locked in” to a particular plan for a period of time — and therefore are restricted to receiving care solely from providers in that plan .
in 2000 , more than 1 million children were enrolled in schip medicaid expansion programs and were therefore also eligible for epsdt services .
