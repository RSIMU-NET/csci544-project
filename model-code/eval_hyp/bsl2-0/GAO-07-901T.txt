vigorous enforcement of anti - discrimination laws remains an essential responsibility of government .
not only is it the right thing to do , but an inclusive work environment can improve retention , reduce turnover , increase our ability to recruit , and improve overall organizational effectiveness .
moreover , diversity in the federal government can be a key component for executing agency missions and achieving results .
discrimination and intolerance are an unfortunate and continuing reality in our country .
overcoming these barriers is more than a professional responsibility for me .
in these efforts , we are all affected by the world we live in .
race , gender , ethnicity , disability , age , and sexual orientation do matter .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss some of the steps we have taken to help enhance diversity and create a fair and inclusive workplace at gao .
i am ron stroman , the managing director of the office of opportunity and inclusiveness at the united states government accountability office ( gao ) .
i have stood outside the rayburn house office building wearing a suit and a tie during the middle of the day trying to hail a cab only to have that cab driver pass me by in order to pick up a white person standing less than five feet behind where i stood .
my son has been stopped by the police repeatedly while driving because he was driving through a community that the police didn't think he belonged in .
overall , gao is making progress toward improving its processes and implementing various program changes that will help address important issues .
good morning .
first , is the continuing challenge of implementing sufficiently specific merit - based policies , safeguards , and training in order to minimize the ability of individual biases to adversely affect the outcome of those policies .
i believe there are two compelling diversity challenges confronting gao and the federal government .
we expect that this program will help all participants enhance job performance and career development opportunities .
the war for talent , especially given increasing competition with the private sector , has made it more competitive for gao and other federal agencies to attract and retain top talent .
these differences are inconsistent with the concerted effort to hire analysts with very similar qualifications , educational backgrounds , and skill sets .
graduates of color from our nation's top colleges and universities have an ever increasing array of career options .
gao is implementing changes to address these areas , including taking steps to better ensure consistency in the interns' experiences and to improve the processes for evaluating their performance and making decisions about permanent job offers .
second , is the challenge of having managers that can communicate with diverse groups of staff , respecting their differences and effectively using their creativity to develop a more dynamic and productive work environment .
we also need to improve transparency in assigning supervisory roles , ensure that all staff have similar opportunities to perform key competencies , and hold managers accountable for results .
finally , we will implement an agencywide mentoring program this summer .
despite our continuing efforts to ensure a level playing field at gao , more needs to be done .
