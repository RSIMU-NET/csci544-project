in fiscal year 2011 , the department of transportation's ( dot ) acquisition workforce negotiated and administered more than $5 billion in contracts to procure a range of products and services and managed large - scale acquisition programs to build and maintain the national transportation system .
however , dot's inspector general reported that the department has not made sufficient progress in implementing strategies and goals to increase the capability of the acquisition workforce and found that gaps in acquisition workforce hiring and development have contributed to poor contract administration and substantial cost overruns on critical programs , such as those related in response to a senate report mandate , we assessed: ( 1 ) the efforts of the office of the secretary of transportation and dot's operating administrations ( oa ) to identify acquisition workforce needs , and ( 2 ) the office of the secretary's role in providing oversight and support for acquisition workforce planning and management .
in our 2011 high risk series update , we reported that the shortage of trained acquisition personnel impedes the capacity and capability of agencies , and puts the federal government at risk for significant overcharges and wasteful spending of the hundreds of billions of contract dollars it spends for goods and services each year .
gao and others have long recognized that the size and capabilities of the government's acquisition workforce is a strategic priority .
to determine the extent to which the office of the senior procurement executive has provided oversight and support for acquisition workforce planning and management , we reviewed relevant federal policy and guidance , as well as dot policy , guidance , and acquisition workforce plans for 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 .
the data we reviewed included information on the size and certification rates of the acquisition workforce , as well as hiring targets , and estimated attrition through fiscal year 2013 .
our review primarily focused on these five oas because they accounted for 92 percent of the department's procurement activity .
we also interviewed officials from the five oas with the highest procurement spending in fiscal year 2011 , based on data from the federal procurement data system - next generation , to discuss the sources and methods used to track data on the acquisition workforce .
we used the following methods to conduct our review: to assess the efforts of the office of the senior procurement executive and dot's oas to identify acquisition workforce staffing and training needs , we reviewed dot's acquisition workforce plans for 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 and interviewed officials from the office of the senior procurement executive and the office of human resources to discuss how the plans were compiled .
for the purposes of this report , we focused on the office of the senior procurement executive , the office within the office of the secretary with primary responsibility for acquisition workforce planning and management .
as a result of this and other limitations , we concluded that the aggregate data presented in dot's acquisition workforce plans were not a sufficient or reliable basis to identify changes over time in the size of the workforce or the number personnel certified to meet federal requirements for education , training , and experience .
