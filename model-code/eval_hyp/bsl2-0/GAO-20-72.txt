this report examines the extent to which tsa has ( 1 ) coordinated with relevant dhs entities to review passenger screening rules and ( 2 ) assessed the effectiveness of its passenger screening rules .
exploring additional data sources — such as checkpoint screening results and federal air marshal service after - action reports — could help tsa refine and supplement their existing efforts to measure program effectiveness .
the act includes a provision for gao to study whether the rules are effective in mitigating potential threats to aviation security ; and whether , and if so how , tsa coordinates with dhs regarding any proposed change to a rule .
the tsa modernization act , enacted in october 2018 , imposed requirements related to the oversight of the silent partner and quiet skies programs .
we also reviewed program standard operating procedures ( sop ) .
 ( recommendation 3 ) .
specifically , the act provides that tsa's intelligence and analysis ( i&a ) office is to identify and review tsa's passenger screening rules , in coordination with other tsa and department of homeland security ( dhs ) stakeholders , within 60 days of enactment and every 120 days thereafter .
by establishing clear criteria for and documentation of each review process , tsa could increase transparency and ensure rule changes are reviewed as intended .
to examine the extent to which tsa coordinated with relevant dhs and tsa entities to review passenger screening rules , we reviewed documentation of steps tsa has taken to coordinate reviews of the rules since october 2018 .
moreover , tsa has not identified a means to comprehensively measure the effectiveness of its silent partner and quiet skies rules .
the lack of clear sops inhibits program oversight .
we compared documentary and testimonial evidence of the current coordination efforts between tsa i&a and stakeholders to the requirements in the tsa modernization act ; dhs and tsa sops ; the quiet skies implementation plan and action memo ; a standards for internal control in the federal government principle related to implementing control activities ; and characteristics of homeland security risk management described in dhs's risk management framework .
we are making the following three recommendations to tsa: the administrator of tsa should clarify the criteria for exigent circumstances and standard rule review procedures ; ( recommendation 1 ) the administrator of tsa should document which rule review process tsa i&a uses ( exigent or standard ) for each new rule or rule change ; ( recommendation 2 ) the administrator of tsa should explore additional data sources measuring the effectiveness of silent partner and quiet skies rules .
it also requires tsa i&a to notify these stakeholders within two days of implementing a new rule or making changes to an existing rule .
to understand the rule review and approval process , we interviewed tsa i&a officials responsible for reviewing and approving silent partner and quiet skies rules and dhs and tsa officials in each office with a specific role in overseeing the program: tsa's civil rights and liberties , ombudsman , and traveler engagement ; dhs's office for civil rights and civil liberties ; tsa's chief counsel ; dhs's office of the general counsel ; tsa's privacy office ; dhs's privacy office ; the federal air marshal service , and dhs's traveler redress inquiry program .
