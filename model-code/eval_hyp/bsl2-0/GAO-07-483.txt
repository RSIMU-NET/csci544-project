to address some of these challenges , airports expecting to receive the a380 are making infrastructure changes to accommodate it that involve retrofitting or expanding existing infrastructure , such as runways and taxiways .
according to airbus , the seating capacity for the a380s currently on order range from about 480 to 650 .
the a380 has a typical seating capacity for 555 passengers , but is certified for a maximum of 853 passengers .
 ( airbus ) , a european aircraft manufacturer , is introducing a airbus s.a.s .
the freight version of the 747-8 is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2009 ; the passenger version of the 747-8 is scheduled for delivery beginning in 2010 .
the 80 feet high , and a maximum takeoff weight of 1.2 million pounds .
 ( airbus ) , a european aircraft manufacturer , is introducing a new large aircraft designated as the a380 .
the freight version of the aircraft , the a380f , has been delayed and the first delivery is to be determined .
when the a380 enters service — which is currently expected in late 2007 — it will be the largest passenger which is currently expected in late 2007 — it will be the largest passenger aircraft in the world , with a wingspan of about 262 feet , a tail fin reaching aircraft in the world , with a wingspan of about 262 feet , a tail fin reaching 80 feet high , and a maximum takeoff weight of 1.2 million pounds .
airbus s.a.s .
when the a380 enters service — new large aircraft designated as the a380 .
thus , to help mitigate future difficulties , federal policymakers , airport officials , and other stakeholders are considering the introduction of the a380 and other new classes of aircraft as they move forward with airport development throughout the nation as well as the development of the next generation air transportation system .
as we have previously reported , the airports estimated that these changes will be costly and were driven by the introduction of the a380 , but they will also benefit current aircraft and other new large aircraft that may be introduced in the future .
further exacerbating this situation is the current and projected growth in air traffic as well as the rollout of new classes of aircraft that could have their own operating and infrastructure requirements .
faa , icao , airbus , and airports have taken several steps to mitigate these challenges .
this will reduce air traffic controllers' flexibility in making routing decisions for the a380 and other aircraft .
in comparison , the largest passenger aircraft the cabin configuration.category as the a380 , and is expected to enter service in late 2010 .
faa , icao , airbus , and airports have taken a number of steps to mitigate potential safety challenges posed by the a380 .
optimizing the use of airspace and airport facilities to the growth in air traffic and new classes of aircraft , including the a380 , will be challenging .
this could limit a380 operations to designated gates , taxiways , or runways at many airports .
the a380 offers air carriers and airports several safety enhancements over existing aircraft .
while the impact of operating restrictions on airport capacity is not clear , faa and industry experts generally agreed that the a380 will add another element of complexity to airport operations and airspace management .
