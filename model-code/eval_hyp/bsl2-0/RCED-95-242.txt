federal assistance authorized by the president includes assistance from other federal agencies , including sba .
a presidential “disaster declaration” authorizes federal assistance in the affected state ( s ) ; fema determines which counties within the state will receive assistance and the type ( s ) of assistance .
assistance from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and / or the small business administration ( sba ) may be provided if requested by state governors .
fema's assistance is triggered if the president declares that an emergency or disaster exists and that federal resources are required to supplement state and local resources .
concerned about potential differences in the federal government's treatment of disaster declaration requests for rural areas as compared with requests for urban areas , you asked us to provide information on the disaster declaration process .
specifically , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine if fema's and sba's disaster declaration policies and procedures differ for requests for rural , as compared with urban , areas ; ( 2 ) compare the length of time taken for each agency to respond to requests for rural and for urban areas ; ( 3 ) compare the proportion of requests for rural areas that were granted with the corresponding proportion for urban areas ; and ( 4 ) perform a limited number of case studies to identify factors that influence the length of time taken for the disaster declaration process .
in the absence of a presidential declaration , the sba administrator may declare that counties struck by disasters are eligible to receive some types of assistance from sba .
when disasters such as floods , tornadoes , or earthquakes strike , state and local governments are called upon to help citizens cope .
neither agency's factors include any measure of population density .
 ( app .
neither sba's nor fema's disaster declaration policies and procedures differ with respect to whether the affected area is considered rural or urban .
both agencies employ a process of assessing postdisaster conditions and using a set of factors , or criteria , to determine whether or not to grant assistance .
in fiscal 1994 , fema obligated about $5.4 billion for disaster assistance .
individual assistance grants to individuals and families to help them recover from the effects of disaster - related damage include housing and unemployment assistance .
in fiscal 1994 , sba obligated about $4.2 billion for disaster assistance .
as noted above , sba's policy is to suspend action on requests it receives if the governor has requested a presidential declaration that includes individual assistance .
fema's public assistance grants help state and local governments and eligible private nonprofit organizations to fund repairs to damaged public facilities and address health and safety threats .
also contributing to sba's quick declaration was that the damage occurred in a concentrated area , and it is easier to evaluate damage when it is concentrated than when it is more widely dispersed .
sba's declaration process and criteria are published in the code of federal regulations .
sba and fema have independent authorities for providing disaster assistance .
the types of assistance provided include money ( grants and loans ) , equipment , supplies , housing , and personnel .
