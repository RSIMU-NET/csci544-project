the act requires executive agencies to establish and to in 2010 , opm set a high - priority performance goal of increasing by 50 percent the number of eligible federal workers who telework by fiscal year 2011 .
according to opm , in order to help agencies overcome barriers related to telework and raise federal telework participation rates , the agency needs reliable , systematically collected agency data .
however , concerns have existed about the reliability of these data .
the act also requires opm to report annually to congress on the telework programs of each agency , including the level of participation in telework in each agency , each agency's goal for increasing employee participation in telework , agency progress during the reporting period toward meeting telework goals , and reasons for significant increases or decreases from previous year telework participation .
the office of personnel management ( opm ) has reported telework can enhance the productivity and flexibility of federal employees ; help recruit and retain a qualified workforce ; and reduce real estate , overhead , energy , and environmental costs .
to measure agency progress toward this and agency telework goals , opm will use data it collects through an annual survey referred to as the data call .
because of the new telework reporting requirements in the act and the need for reliable data to assess the agencies' progress in implementing their individual telework programs , you asked us to assess opm's: actions to respond to the reporting requirements of the telework enhancement act of 2010 , and handling of identified data reliability issues in the 2011 telework data call .
the telework enhancement act of 2010 established a statutory framework for implementing a comprehensive federal telework program.implement a policy under which eligible employees may be authorized to telework .
congress has encouraged federal agencies to expand their use of telework by requiring that executive agencies establish telework policies , incorporate those policies into continuity of operations plans , and provide interactive telework training to employees and managers .
to answer these questions , we reviewed relevant reports and guidance published by opm that describe the status of telework programs across executive agencies , and previous telework data calls and their instructions .
we identified the relevant generally accepted survey standards as promulgated by the office of management and budget and compared opm's design and implementation of the 2011 telework data call against these standards .
we also reviewed our previous reports on telework and the reliability of opm's telework data .
this included discussions on the role of the interagency telework measurement group ( itmg ) , the process for developing the definitions and key terms used in the data call , the training and assistance provided to executive agency officials responsible for completing the data call , and agency plans to address outstanding data reliability issues associated with the data call .
opm cautions that existing measures of telework participation are a barrier to measuring any increase in telework as the measures vary widely in validity and reliability and limit the capability of any federal body to track the actual level and frequency of telework participation .
in its 2003 and 2007 telework reports to congress , opm raised concerns about the ability of agencies to track employee participation in their telework programs .
