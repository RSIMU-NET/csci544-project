if the labor market has experienced structural changes , it would also have implications for labor market and other microeconomic policies ( e.g. , spending or tax provisions that increase the incentives to hire , seek work , delay retirement , or train ) , which are beyond the scope of this report .
it concludes by analyzing the implications of these developments for macroeconomic stabilization policy , as policy makers grapple with the transition from the expansionary fiscal and monetary policy put in place during the "great recession. .
this report analyzes recent trends in labor market indicators during the current economic recovery , with a particular focus on the contrast between the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators .
it then considers whether the economy might reach full employment at a higher rate of unemployment compared to recent expansions .
it reviews studies that have sought to determine how much of the decline in the labor force participation rate is caused by the recession and how much is caused by structural factors , such as the aging of the labor force .
understanding this divergence is crucial for an accurate assessment of the current state of the economic recovery and of how close the economy is to full employment .
the labor force participation rate has fallen to under 63% at the end of 2013 from 66% before the recession .
other economic and labor market indicators paint a more pessimistic picture , however .
for example , the decline in the unemployment rate was caused in part by workers dropping out of the labor force .
the unemployment rate declined markedly in 2013 , to 6.7% in december from 7.9% in january , seeming to signal that the labor market is approaching full employment .
in the mainstream economic view , congress can hasten economic recovery by increasing the budget deficit ( fiscal stimulus ) .
the slow decline in the unemployment rate and continued lack of employment opportunities for youth and the long - term unemployed in the current recovery have raised concerns that the natural rate of unemployment may have risen recently .
thus , many economists advocate further deficit reduction ( fiscal austerity ) as the economy nears full employment .
congress is directly responsible for fiscal policy through its control of federal revenue and spending provisions .
but borrowing has long - term economic costs and inter - generational equity implications , and the benefits of fiscal stimulus decline as the economy approaches full employment .
cbo has estimated that it has ranged from 5.0% to 6.3% since 1949 .
reaching a consensus on whether the protracted period of high unemployment was the result of temporarily inadequate aggregate demand , an upward shift in the natural rate of unemployment unrelated to the recession , or an upward shift caused by hysteresis will require more evidence â€” notably , how much further unemployment falls in the current expansion before inflation rises .
cbo has estimated that the natural rate of unemployment rose to 6% in 2013 from 5% in 2007 .
since the natural rate is defined as the underlying rate of unemployment once cyclical factors are removed , conventional economic theory posits that changes in the natural rate would be driven only by structural factors unrelated to the business cycle , such as demographics .
