these examples of differing policies , among others examples not mentioned , when combined with agencies' adoption of additional telework flexibilities , raise questions about how agencies will be responding to foia requests in the near future .
conversely , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) has adopted a contrasting policy , saying that cdc would not be able to respond to mailed foia requests and that requests should be placed electronically .
this report provides an overview of the foia request process and actual and potential foia request processing changes within federal government agencies as a result of covid - 19 .
r ecently , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) announced that it would only accept mailed freedom of information act ( foia ) requests and not those submitted electronically due to the covid - 19 pandemic .
government information requests through foia may be impacted by covid - 19 in two ways: ( 1 ) certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration ; and ( 2 ) processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave .
â§552 ( a ) ( 6 ) ) .
table 1 presents these recent statements regarding the impact of covid - 19 or simply changes in agencies' abilities to process foia requests , provides code of federal regulations ( c.f.r. ) .
some statements also discuss current operating status , and mention anticipated delays due to covid - 19 .
as of march 26 , 2020 , crs identified statements by 13 agencies regarding covid - 19's impact on foia request processing .
citations to each agency's policy regarding expedited foia requests , and notes whether the agency has made additional allowances for expediting requests .
while challenges in locating responsive information may occur at any agency , responses to requests for information during the covid - 19 outbreak have varied .
crs performed a search of federal department websites and their components .
six of the identified agencies have additional allowances for expediting requests: u.s. air force , department of housing and urban development , department of labor , department of veterans affairs , national archives and records administration , and office of government information services .
of the 13 agencies identified , 8 altered the transmission method by which a foia request should be submitted .
complex or incorrectly routed requests may be subject to additional days of processing , per the statute ( 5 u.s.c .
the table should be considered a snapshot in time , as agencies may update or change their statements .
requesters may administratively appeal an agency's adverse decision .
foia does not require requests for agency information to be submitted in a particular format , only that the request reasonably describes the records sought and complies with agency regulations .
of the six agencies that established additional allowances for expediting requests , five permit expediting cases where due process rights would be impacted , four permit expediting cases where there exist possible questions affecting public confidence in the federal government's integrity , one permits expediting due to humanitarian needs , and one permits expediting at the discretion of the agency's foia officer .
