moreover , when consumer spending and bank lending are curtailed , fiscal policy initiatives ( e.g. , tax cuts or spending increases ) become less effective at stimulating the economy .
household debt reduction ( or deleveraging ) may have important implications for job creation and economic recovery .
for example , academic experts have proposed large - scale mortgage refinancing efforts to propel economic stimulus .
simultaneous declines in household income and net worth made it difficult for some households to support previous debt levels , thus encouraging them to reduce debt service obligations and work toward restoring the health of their balance sheets .
if refinancing activity results in lower mortgage payments , then households may have more discretionary income to spend and , therefore , spur economic stimulus .
deleveraging may translate into a reduction in near - term consumption , which typically accounts for approximately 70% of gross domestic product and likely an important source of economic recovery .
in light of the 2007-2009 recession , however , households are reducing their debt burdens .
deleveraging may also manifest itself in the form of above normal loan defaults that weaken the banking system and discourage new lending , which can be the source of job creation .
some households , however , are choosing to pay down current debt obligations , which means any additional income that would have gone toward mortgage interest still may not be applied to new spending .
in light of these recommendations , the purpose of policy initiatives ( e.g. , the home affordable refinance program [harp] , h.r .
hence , policies aimed at stimulating near - term consumption may instead enhance future borrowing capacity and longer - term consumption if households continue to strengthen their balance sheets via near - term deleveraging .
363 and its companion s. 170 , the housing opportunity and mortgage equity act of 2011 ) is to facilitate the refinancing of mortgages .
over the past several decades , u.s. household indebtedness has generally risen regardless of macroeconomic or financial conditions .
on the supply side , rising loan losses caused lenders to write off more obligations , which put a strain on lenders' ( regulatory ) capital reserves .
in addition , the obama administration announced an initiative to assist qualified homeowners , whose mortgages are not owned or guaranteed by any institution affiliated with the federal government , in lowering their mortgage rates .
consequently , lending standards are higher and likely to remain until lenders feel more confident that borrowers have the ability to repay .
it also presents various explanations for deleveraging â€” in particular , changes in both consumer demand and lending supply .
on the demand side , job losses and declining wealth particularly associated with declining real estate values are factors that made it difficult for households to repay old loans or secure new ones .
household debt balances fell in the third quarter of 2008 and continued to do so until the second quarter of 2011 when they rose by 0.55% before resuming their downward trend .
this report presents data illustrating household deleveraging since 2008 in comparison to previous trends in household credit use .
rising loan losses may cause lenders to be more skeptical about extending new credit without greater assurances of repayment .
