to address certain challenges , congress has passed legislation including the biggert - waters flood insurance reform act of 2012 ( biggert - waters act ) and the homeowner flood insurance affordability act of 2014 ( hfiaa ) .
hfiaa sought to address these affordability concerns by repealing or altering some biggert - waters act requirements .
the biggert - waters act sought to strengthen the future financial solvency and administrative efficiency of nfip , but it also raised concerns for policyholders whose premiums increased .
as of march 2016 , fema owed treasury $23 billion .
nfip is administered by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) .
as a result of the program's importance , level of indebtedness to treasury , and substantial financial exposure for the federal government and taxpayers , as well as fema's operating and management challenges , nfip has been on our high - risk list since 2006 .
hfiaa also included provisions for the study of voluntary community - based flood insurance ( cbfi ) .
since then , fema has needed to borrow money from the u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) to cover claims in some years .
since 2000 , nfip has experienced several years with catastrophic losses , primarily from hurricane katrina and the other 2005 storms and superstorm sandy in 2012 .
in september 2014 , fema awarded a contract to the national academy of sciences ( nas ) to conduct a study on potentially making voluntary cbfi policies available through nfip .
specifically , the study as contracted was to include , but was not limited to , discussion of topic areas and questions that would require further evaluation in order for fema and others to better evaluate strengths and weaknesses of providing cbfi .
specifically , hfiaa included provisions for fema to conduct a study and submit a report that assesses and recommends options , methods , and strategies for making cbfi available through nfip .
in 2007 , we identified four broad policy goals for federal involvement in natural catastrophe insurance: ( 1 ) charging premium rates that fully reflect actual risks ; ( 2 ) encouraging private markets to provide natural catastrophe insurance ; ( 3 ) encouraging broad participation in natural catastrophe insurance programs ; and ( 4 ) limiting costs to taxpayers before and after a disaster .
the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) makes federally backed flood insurance available to property owners in participating communities and is the only source of insurance against flood damage for most residents of flood - prone areas .
while there is no single generally accepted definition for cbfi , the term generally refers to the concept of a single , community - wide flood insurance policy that a community would purchase to cover all properties located within it .
in addition , we have reported that some communities may face challenges administering nfip and flood mitigation programs .
additionally , hfiaa included a provision for gao to review and analyze fema's cbfi report , and report to the relevant congressional committees .
nas completed a pre - publication version of the study and submitted it to fema in july 2015 and published the final version of the study in december 2015 .
