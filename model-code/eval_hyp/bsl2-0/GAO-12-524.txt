fighter aircraft modernization is not new within the department of defense ( dod ) .
selected acquisition reports are key recurring summary status reports to the congress on the cost , schedule , and performance of dod's major defense acquisition programs .
the air force currently expects to invest a total of $9.7 billion in its f - 22a modernization program from 2003 through 2023 .
in response , this report identifies and discusses key differences and similarities in the f - 22a modernization strategy and those of the legacy programs you identified .
in fact , the air force and navy have modernized many of their fighter and attack aircraft over the past several decades .
given this historical experience , and citing the mounting cost and timing of f - 22a modernization , you requested that we examine the history of the modernization programs of the f - 15 , f - 16 , f / a - 18 , and f - 117a , and compare those legacy programs with the f - 22a modernization program .

we met with , and in some cases reviewed the writings of , current and former air force , navy , and contractor officials with firsthand knowledge of the programs we were reviewing in order to gain additional insights into when , why , and how they went about modernizing .
as a result , the cost , schedule , and performance projections for the f - 22a modernization program were not well founded and , over time , costs have doubled and the delivery of the full required capability has been delayed by more than 7 years .
an overall incremental approach to development and early modernization planning were keys to the success of the legacy aircraft modernization programs we reviewed .
in contrast , the legacy modernization programs were primarily initiated to make incremental improvements to existing mission capabilities .
§ 2432. documents , prior gao reports , and other pertinent documents .
the current total estimated cost of f - 22a modernization is $9.7 billion .
in most cases , the programs delivered initial increments of aircraft with limited capabilities , with the expectation that they would be upgraded over time as funding and technologies became available .
in the course of our work , we talked with contractor and former program officials who provided limited insights into the initial development of the f - 117a stealth aircraft .
as dod pursues more complex and costly fighter aircraft to meet the advanced threats of the future , it is increasingly important that programs begin planning for incremental modernization at the earliest possible point .
however , because of to the amount of time that had passed and the highly classified nature of the program , key documentation and data were not readily accessible .
although the legacy and f - 22a programs began modernizing at the same general points in time , the f - 22a did not originally plan for a major modernization program , so when the aircraft's mission changed in 2003 , the resources — primarily technology and funding — needed to meet the new requirements had not been fully developed or identified .
in addition , the majority of the f - 22a modernization upgrades will be retrofitted onto fielded aircraft — a complex and costly undertaking — and by the time all of the required capabilities are fielded the amount of useful life remaining on the aircraft will likely be limited .
