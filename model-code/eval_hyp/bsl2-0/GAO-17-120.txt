we recommended that ondcp ( 1 ) strengthen internal controls ; ( 2 ) ensure that funded grant applicants satisfy statutory eligibility criteria ; and ( 3 ) more clearly define its own and samhsa's roles and responsibilities .
ondcp agreed and has made significant improvements and implemented all three recommendations .
the dfc support program focuses its efforts on the prevention and reduction of the use of four primary substances , referred to in this report as drugs: ( 1 ) alcohol , ( 2 ) tobacco , ( 3 ) marijuana , and ( 4 ) the illicit use of prescription drugs .
the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) administers the dfc support program , in coordination with the u.s. department of health and human services' substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) .
this report addresses: ( 1 ) the extent to which ondcp and samhsa use leading practices to coordinate program administration and the types of activities the dfc support program recently funded ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which ondcp's and samhsa's operating procedures both ensure dfc grantees comply with governing statutes and provide a basis for performance monitoring .
to help curb youth substance abuse , the drug - free communities act of 1997 established the drug - free communities ( dfc ) support program â€” a federal program providing grants for the establishment of community - based , youth - focused , drug abuse prevention efforts .
to assess the extent to which ondcp and samhsa use leading practices to coordinate program administration , we analyzed relevant documentation , such as policies and procedures including ondcp's and samhsa's inter - agency agreements for fiscal years 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 ( the most recent data available ) .
the office of national drug control policy reauthorization act of 2006 includes a provision that we routinely assess ondcp's programs and operations .
in 2008 , we reported on the dfc support program and found weaknesses in grant program administration .
in addition , ondcp is responsible for , among other things , overseeing and coordinating the implementation of the administration's national drug control strategy .
ondcp funds four types of dfc support program grants: ( 1 ) new ; ( 2 ) continuation ; ( 3 ) mentoring ; and ( 4 ) mentoring continuation .
in 2015 , approximately 2.2 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 were current users of illicit drugs , which represented nearly 9 percent of adolescents in america .
as the number of youth who engage in illicit drug use remains a public health concern , the continued focus on funding grantees and monitoring them for both progress and compliance is vital .
in addition , we interviewed officials responsible for the management of the dfc support program to discuss ondcp's and samhsa's collaboration practices and assessed them against leading practices from prior gao work .
developing an action plan that includes time frames for addressing deficiencies found through its grant file reviews and making systemic changes based on its findings , as well as developing a method for ensuring complete and accurate grantee status reporting to ondcp , would position samhsa officials to further strengthen monitoring efforts .
