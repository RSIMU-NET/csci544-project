to meet increasing global demand for apparel production , primarily by the united states and europe , certain buildings may have been converted to multi - story manufacturing operations .
bangladesh's economy is labor - intensive , which attracts lower - wage and lower - skilled industries such as apparel .
according to press reports , working conditions in bangladesh were theoretically addressed , at least in part , by bangladesh labor laws and building codes , international labor organization ( ilo ) commitments , codes of conduct held by multinational corporations , and gsp trade preferences .
it also raised the issue of what might be done to improve working conditions , especially for lower - wage workers in developing countries around the world .
bangladesh's major export is apparel , which , along with a small amount of textiles , accounts for more than 80% of the country's $24 billion in exports to the world in 2012 , or nearly $20 billion .
a number of factors may have led to the recent building collapse .
soon after that , the government shut down a number of apparel factories , for safety reasons , as concerns about industrial safety across the country continued to grow .
as a result of the rana plaza building collapse , some firms , such as disney , have indicated they may no longer source production from bangladesh , largely due to concerns over their brand reputation .
in many countries , apparel production is generally carried out in one - or two - story buildings because of the inherent fire hazards associated with this production .
it brought international focus on portions of the global supply chain .
these women , mostly muslim , have found new independence and an increased standard of living for their families , and have , in many cases , become primary breadwinners .
according to press reports , the day of the building collapse workers arrived and saw cracks in the outside of the building where five manufacturing operations were trying to meet production deadlines on apparel products for the u.s. and european union ( eu ) markets .
the effect on the economic structure of bangladesh could be compounded by an ongoing struggle between a secular bangladeshi identity and a more fundamental / religious islamic identity .
if this becomes a major trend , one consequence could be that many women , who constitute 80% of the workers in the apparel sector , could lose their jobs .
bangladesh is a densely populated country , where a population half the size of the united states is crowded into a geographic area the size of iowa .
three additional floors that reportedly were illegally constructed were added to the rana plaza .
what are its current efforts in bangladesh ? .
the combined tragedies brought the six - month total loss of life in bangladesh in the garment sector to at least 1,200 .
on april 24 , 2013 , rana plaza , an eight - story building , in dhaka , bangladesh , collapsed , killing more than 1,100 garment workers .
how much progress have the accord and the alliance achieved so far in promoting safety workplaces in bangladesh ? .
