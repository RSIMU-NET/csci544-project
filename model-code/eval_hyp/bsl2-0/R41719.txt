continued support for fannie and freddie has been costly .
as of the fourth quarter of 2010 , these purchases have totaled $90.2 billion for fannie mae and $63.7 billion for freddie mac .
because private capital has not yet returned to the market , over 90% of new mortgages are purchased , guaranteed , and securitized by fannie , freddie , or full - faith - and - credit government agencies , such as the federal housing administration ( fha ) and the government national mortgage association ( ginnie mae ) .
new mbs issues fell dramatically â€” to only $5.4 billion in 2010 .
under conservatorship , fannie and freddie have continued their mbs issuance and have not significantly reduced the size of their portfolios .
as a result , fannie and freddie's regulator , the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) , now exercises complete control over their operations .
it is widely accepted that fannie and freddie's operations have made mortgage credit more accessible and affordable .
fannie mae and freddie mac are government - sponsored enterprises ( gses ) that have played a central role in mortgage finance .
in addition , fannie and freddie own about $1.5 trillion in mortgages and mbs , which they hold in their investment portfolios .
under the terms of the conservatorship , the treasury has agreed to inject capital into both firms ( in the form of preferred - stock purchases ) as necessary to prevent either firm from having a negative net worth .
currently , the value of mortgages purchased , securitized , and guaranteed by fannie and freddie exceeds $5 trillion , about half of all u.s. single - family residential mortgages .
even though both firms are operating at a loss to the government , they are essentially propping up the housing market .
if fannie and freddie had ceased operations , mortgage securitization would have dried up , and it is likely that few banks would have been willing to risk making new mortgage loans .
banks are more willing to make mortgage loans if they can sell them into the secondary market rather than bear the risks of long - term lending .
liquidation of fannie and freddie would have entailed dumping mortgage assets on the market at a time when many institutions were struggling to cope with losses from mbs and mortgages already on their balance sheets .
"private - label" mbs securitized mortgage loans that fannie and freddie's charters prohibited them from purchasing ; between 2002 and 2007 , private issuers sold more than $3 trillion in mbs .
the source of credit is no longer the local banking industry , which is subject to periodic , cyclical contractions that reduce its ability to lend , but rather the global bond market .
prices would almost certainly have plunged , driving up the cost to new mortgage borrowers .
a healthy secondary market ensures the availability of funds for mortgage borrowing .
the downturn in the housing market that crippled the private mbs market was also ruinous for fannie and freddie .
by september 2008 , it was clear that both fannie and freddie were insolvent , and the government stepped in to place both firms under conservatorship .
