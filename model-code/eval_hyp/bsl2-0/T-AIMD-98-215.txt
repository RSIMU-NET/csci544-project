447 ) , passed on june 9 , 1998 , which underscored congressional demands for quickly resolving outstanding financial management problems .
to build upon these efforts , the subcommittee is exploring ways to expedite fixing the problems that hamper effective financial management across government today .
the subcommittee's efforts are in concert with the house of representatives resolution ( h.res .
considerable effort is underway across government to make needed improvements and progress is being made , but a great deal of perseverance will be required to fully attain the legislative goals set by federal financial management statutes .
this legislative framework includes the 1990 chief financial officers ( cfo ) act , as expanded by the 1994 government management reform act , as well as the 1996 federal financial management improvement act ( ffmia ) .
the federal government can continue to make progress in implementing financial management reforms , but the pace and extent of improvement will depend upon the dedication of agency heads and their senior management teams , especially the chief financial officers , and the ability to deal with a range of financial management systems issues , as well as continuing emphasis by the congress on financial management reform .
broad oversight by the congress will be very important to holding agency heads accountable for needed financial management improvements .
this discipline is needed to correct long - standing serious weaknesses in federal financial management systems , controls , and reporting practices .
we are pleased to discuss ways the congress can help ensure that agencies effectively implement federal financial management reform legislation .
these reforms begin to subject the federal government to the same fiscal discipline imposed for years on the private sector and state and local governments .
to further promote needed reforms , ffmia calls for agencies to meet various financial management standards and requirements and , if they do not , to prepare remediation plans .
the congress would make a significant contribution to ensuring satisfactory results in this area if the results of financial audits and needed improvements became a routine part of its normal annual appropriation , authorization , and oversight deliberations .
these statutes establish a broad - based set of expectations for improving financial management , such as producing reliable financial reports , generating sound cost and performance information , fixing weaknesses in systems and controls , and building effective financial management organizations .
additionally , audited consolidated financial statements for the u.s. government are now required annually , starting with those for fiscal year 1997 .
an essential foundation to help achieve these goals is the requirement that the 24 cfo act agencies annually prepare financial statements and subject them to an independent audit , beginning with those for fiscal year 1996 .
congressional attention is essential to help sustain the current momentum to implement financial management reform legislation .
unless successfully dealt with , this crisis presents the likelihood of new financial management systems weaknesses occurring , existing problems worsening , and ongoing reform efforts being derailed .
this will likely affect the pace of progress on modernizing financial systems , as some agencies' efforts to address the year 2000 computing crisis are taking precedence over longer - term financial management systems development and improvement initiatives .
