appropriations for these programs have nearly doubled from about $230 million in fiscal year 1999 to about $432 million in fiscal year 2004 .
congress reaffirmed its commitment by expanding the number of assistance programs in reauthorizing hea in 1998 and has steadily increased funding since then .
given the recent expansion of these programs , we examined them to determine ( 1 ) how institutions used their title iii and title v grants and the benefits they received from using these grant funds , ( 2 ) what objectives and strategies the department of education ( education ) has developed for title iii and title v programs , and ( 3 ) to what extent education monitors and provides assistance to title iii and title v institutions .
beginning in 1965 , congress created several programs under the higher education act ( hea ) to support postsecondary institutions that provide low - income and minority students with access to higher education .
to determine the objectives and strategies education has developed for title iii and title v programs , we talked with education officials and reviewed program and planning documents .
these institutions included four historically black colleges and universities in georgia , two tribal colleges in north dakota , and three hispanic serving institutions in texas .
to determine how institutions used title iii and title v funds and the resulting benefits , we developed a data collection instrument and reviewed grant files for a stratified random sample of 104 of the 206 title iii and title v grant recipients , including the grant application , grant performance reports , and related correspondence .
to determine how education monitors and provides assistance to the title iii and title v grantees , we interviewed education and postsecondary institution officials and reviewed documents , including program policies and guidance .
education has taken steps to enhance its monitoring and assistance efforts .
education needs to fully implement these plans to provide oversight and assistance to those institutions most in need .
additionally , we conducted site visits to nine of the postsecondary institutions included in our sample based on type of program participation and geographic proximity to one another .
we conducted our work between july 2003 and august 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
however , education has yet to fully implement many of these initiatives .
institutions eligible for funding under titles iii and v include historically black colleges and universities ( hbcus ) , tribal colleges , hispanic serving institutions ( hsis ) , alaska native and native hawaiian institutions , and other undergraduate postsecondary institutions that serve low - income students .
we estimate that over half of the grantees reported using their funds for initiatives that focused on improving institutional management and fiscal stability .
however , by failing to carry out an effective process to identify and target oversight and assistance to at - risk grantees , education has fallen short of ensuring that these institutions have all the tools they need to fulfill the programs' objectives .
education recognizes that it must work in partnership with its grantees to enhance the quality of and access to postsecondary education and has put in place plans that would allow it to better monitor and assist grantees .
