recognizing the importance of issues related to the government - wide acquisition of it , in december 2014 , congress enacted federal it acquisition reform legislation ( commonly referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act or fitara ) .
for example , as of december 2016 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) and agencies had implemented 366 ( or about 46 percent ) of the 803 open recommendations that we had made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015 related to it acquisitions and operations .
in particular , the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments , which often suffered from ineffective management .
in addition , in february 2015 , we added improving the management of it acquisitions and operations to our list of high - risk areas for the federal government .
we recently issued an update to our high - risk report and determined that , while progress has been made in addressing this high - risk area , significant work remains to be completed .
this statement summarizes our prior work primarily published between june 2013 and february 2017 on ( 1 ) key it workforce planning practices , ( 2 ) risk levels of major investments as reported on omb's it dashboard , and ( 3 ) implementation of incremental development practices , among other issues .
my statement today discusses agencies' progress in improving the acquisition of it .
as you know , the effective and efficient acquisition of it has been a long - standing challenge in the federal government .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss opportunities for federal agencies to improve the acquisition of information technology ( it ) .
federal it projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance .
the federal government is projected to invest more than $89 billion on it in fiscal year 2017 .
this area highlights several critical it initiatives in need of additional congressional oversight , including ( 1 ) reviews of troubled projects ; ( 2 ) efforts to increase the use of incremental development ; ( 3 ) efforts to provide transparency relative to the cost , schedule , and risk levels for major it investments ; ( 4 ) reviews of agencies' operational investments ; ( 5 ) data center consolidation ; and ( 6 ) efforts to streamline agencies' portfolios of it investments .
specifically , between fiscal years 2010 and 2015 , we made 803 recommendations to omb and federal agencies to address shortcomings in it acquisitions and operations , including many to improve the implementation of the recent initiatives and other government - wide , cross - cutting efforts .
our past work has also identified nine critical factors underlying successful major acquisitions that support the objective of improving the management of large - scale it acquisitions across the federal government: ( 1 ) program officials actively engaging with stakeholders ; ( 2 ) program staff having the necessary knowledge and skills ; ( 3 ) senior department and agency executives supporting the programs ; ( 4 ) end users and stakeholders being involved in the development of requirements ; ( 5 ) end users participating in the testing of system functionality prior to end user acceptance testing ; ( 6 ) government and contractor staff being stable and consistent ; ( 7 ) program staff prioritizing requirements ; ( 8 ) program officials maintaining regular communication with the prime contractor ; and ( 9 ) programs receiving sufficient funding .
