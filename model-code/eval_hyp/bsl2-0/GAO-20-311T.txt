in particular , we discuss federal agencies' ( 1 ) implementation of chief information officer ( cio ) responsibilities , ( 2 ) fulfillment of cio it acquisition review requirements , ( 3 ) data center consolidation efforts , ( 4 ) management of software licenses , and ( 5 ) cybersecurity .
with regard to cybersecurity , the increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the continuing and urgent need for effective information security .
the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments , which often suffered from ineffective management .
in 2018 , we updated this high - risk area to reflect the lack of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for the federal government .
consequently , we added improving the management of it acquisitions and operations to our high - risk areas for the federal government in february 2015 .
my statement today provides an update on agencies' progress in improving the management of it acquisitions and operations and the nation's cybersecurity .
specifically , the statement summarizes our key reports issued since 2011 on these issues and assesses agencies' progress in implementing our associated recommendations .
in march 2019 , we reported that , while progress had been made in addressing the high - risk area of it acquisitions and operations , significant work remained to be completed .
we first identified federal information security as a government - wide high - risk area in 1997 .
subsequently , in 2003 , we expanded this area to include computerized systems supporting the nation's critical infrastructure , and , in 2015 , we further expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information .
i am pleased to be here today to provide an update on federal agencies' efforts to address our high - risk areas on improving the management of information technology ( it ) acquisitions and operations , as well as ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation .
most agencies have taken steps to execute key it management and cybersecurity requirements and initiatives , including implementing cio responsibilities , requiring cio reviews of it acquisitions , realizing data center consolidation cost savings , managing software assets , and complying with fisma requirements .
nevertheless , further efforts by omb and federal agencies to implement our previous recommendations would better position them to improve the management and security of federal it .
to help ensure that these efforts succeed , we will continue to monitor agencies' efforts toward implementing the recommendations .
federal it projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance .
the agencies have also continued to address the recommendations that we have made over the past several years .
the federal government plans to invest over $90 billion for it in fiscal year 2019 .
congress and the president enacted the federal information security modernization act of 2014 ( fisma ) to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government - wide responsibilities .
in conclusion , by addressing the high - risk areas on improving the management of it acquisitions and operations and ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation , the government has the opportunity to both save billions of dollars and advance the efficiency and effectiveness of government services .
