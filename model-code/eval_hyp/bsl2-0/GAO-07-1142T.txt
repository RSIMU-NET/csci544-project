my testimony today ( 1 ) summarizes our key findings on leadership , response capabilities , and accountability controls and the efforts made by dhs and fema in their implementation of the post - katrina reform act and other recommendations made in the aftermath of hurricane katrina , and ( 2 ) highlights several disaster management issues for continued congressional attention .
as the comptroller general testified in february 2007 on dhs's high - risk status and specifically disaster preparedness and response , dhs must overcome continuing challenges , including those related to clearly defining leadership roles and responsibilities , developing necessary disaster response capabilities , and establishing accountability systems to provide effective services while protecting against waste , fraud , and abuse .
it is important to view preparedness for and response to major disasters as a national system with linked responsibilities and capabilities .
these issues are enormously complex and challenging for all levels of government .
this is because effective preparedness for and response to major disasters requires the coordinated planning and actions of multiple actors from multiple first responder disciplines , jurisdictions , and levels of government as well as nongovernmental entities .
achieving this goal for major disasters , and catastrophic disasters in particular , is difficult because success requires effective pre - and post - disaster coordination and cooperation among different levels of government , nongovernmental organizations , and the private sector .
the experience of hurricane katrina illustrated why it is important to tackle these difficult issues .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss issues associated with the federal emergency management agency's ( fema ) , an agency within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and its efforts to address the shortcomings of the preparation and response to hurricane katrina and enhance its capabilities for responding to major disasters , including hurricanes .
individuals can also contribute to success through such things as knowing evacuation routes , complying with evacuation orders , and having a family and individual disaster preparation plan and supplies .
the goal of disaster preparedness and response is easy to state but difficult to achieve and can be stated as follows: to prevent where possible , prepare for , mitigate , and respond to disasters of any size or cause with well - planned , well - coordinated , and effective actions that minimize the loss of life and property and set the stage for a quick recovery .
almost two years ago , hurricane katrina severely tested disaster management at the federal , state , and local levels and revealed weaknesses in the basic elements of preparing for , responding , to and recovering from any catastrophic disaster .
parochialism must be put aside and cooperation must prevail before and after an emergency event .
my comments today are based on our body of work on disaster and emergency management including more than 30 reports on the aftermath of hurricane katrina , our review of recent emergency management reform legislative changes , and materials and statements provided by fema .
the 2007 hurricane season has started and its peak period will begin in a few weeks .
congressional oversight in the short term might include dhs's policies regarding oversight assistance .
we conducted our audit work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
