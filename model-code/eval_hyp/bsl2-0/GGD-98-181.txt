concerns about the procurement of currency paper resulted in congress including in the 1997 emergency supplemental appropriations act a requirement that we complete a comprehensive analysis of the “optimum circumstances for government procurement of distinctive currency paper” and report our findings to the house and senate committees on appropriations .
in the conference report accompanying the appropriations bill , the conference committee expressed concern over the fact that the bureau of engraving and printing ( bep ) of the department of the treasury has bought virtually all of its paper for the nation's currency from a single supplier for over 100 years .
in june 1997 , the chairman of the house government reform and oversight committee asked that we also report our findings to that committee because of its interest in federal procurement matters , and senator lautenberg requested that we report our findings to his office as well .
in september 1997 , 16 members of congress informed us of their interest in our analysis and expressed their opinion that a review of the potential benefits and drawbacks of a single - supplier relationship would be appropriate .
the conference committee directed that we report on any limitations on competition in currency paper procurement and possible alternatives to the way bep has been buying the paper , the fairness and reasonableness of prices paid for the paper , the potential for disruption of the availability of currency paper from bep's reliance on a single supplier , and other matters .
these changes would require existing statutory limitations to be amended .
there are also other options for obtaining competition that are allowed under procurement laws and have been used by other federal agencies .
