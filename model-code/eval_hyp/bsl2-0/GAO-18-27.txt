the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2014 required that the secretary of defense ensure that a full audit is performed on dod's fiscal year 2018 financial statements and that the results be submitted to congress no later than march 31 , 2019 .
the working group conducts biweekly meetings to discuss current initiatives , any outstanding issues , and progress toward its goals .
the department of defense ( dod ) has been on gao's high - risk list since 1995 in part because of long - standing , uncorrected deficiencies with its financial management systems , business processes , financial manager qualifications , and material internal control and financial reporting weaknesses .
when financial statements are not prepared with supported accounting entries , there is a risk that dod and army management cannot rely on the army's accounting system data when making management and resource decisions .
therefore , with oversight from the office of the assistant secretary of the army for financial management and comptroller ( asa ( fm&c ) ) , personnel from the army and the defense finance and accounting service ( dfas ) , the army's service provider , formed a journal voucher working group ( working group ) in february 2015 to address the inadequate support of jvs affecting the army's financial statements .
these deficiencies prevent dod from having auditable financial statements , which is one of the three major impediments preventing us from expressing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government .
according to dod , one of the contributing factors to its inability to produce auditable financial statements is the billions of dollars of unsupported journal vouchers ( jv ) within its accounting systems , with the largest portion attributed to the department of the army's ( army ) general fund .
 ( recommendation 2 ) .
our objectives were to report the extent to which the working group , as of march 2017 , ( 1 ) performed analyses to determine the root causes of unsupported jvs for the army's general fund and ( 2 ) developed and monitored the implementation of corrective action plans to address identified root causes of unsupported jvs .
additionally , ad hoc meetings are scheduled as needed .
pursuant to the ndaa for fiscal year 2010 , dod developed and has updated a financial improvement and audit readiness ( fiar ) plan .
we inquired about any limitations or challenges that prevented the working group from fully implementing any developed corrective action plans .
the working group has been tasked to actively work toward reducing the number of unsupported jvs for the army's general fund .
this audit was initiated as part of the mandate that requires gao to audit the u.s. government's consolidated financial statements , which cover all accounts and associated activities of the executive branch agencies , including dod , because of the significance of the military services' financial statements to the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government .
specifically , one of the main focuses of the working group is to determine the root causes of unsupported jvs and to develop corrective action plans for the identified root causes .
