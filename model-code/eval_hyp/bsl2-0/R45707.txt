these losses were concentrated in business interruption insurance ( 34% of the losses ) , property insurance ( 30% ) , and liability insurance ( 23% ) .
in most states , state regulators must approve policy form changes .
in november 2002 , congress responded to the fears of economic damage due to the absence of commercially available coverage for terrorism with passage of the terrorism risk insurance act ( tria ) .
estimates of insured losses from the 9 / 11 attacks are more than $45 billion in current dollars , the largest insured losses from a nonnatural disaster on record .
most state regulators agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from commercial policies , just as these policies had long excluded war risks .
the tria program was amended and extended in 2005 , 2007 , and 2015 .
although the evidence is largely anecdotal , some were concerned that the lack of coverage posed a threat of serious harm — such as job loss — to these industries , in turn threatening the broader economy .
in some cases , such insurance is required to consummate various transactions , particularly in the real estate , transportation , construction , energy , and utility sectors .
following the 2015 amendments , the tria program is set to expire at the end of 2020 .
bills to expand tria were resisted by then - president george w. bush's administration , and previous presidential budgets under then - president obama called for changes in the program that would have had the effect of scaling back the tria coverage .
terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremely expensive , and many businesses were no longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks .
the current administration has not called for specific changes to tria , but has indicated that it is "evaluating reforms…to further decrease taxpayer exposure. .
although primary insurance companies — those that actually sell and service the insurance policies bought by consumers — suffered losses from the terrorist attacks , the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers , the insurers of insurance companies .
tria created a three - year terrorism insurance program to provide a government reinsurance backstop in the case of terrorist attacks .
the insurance industry largely continues to support tria , as do commercial insurance consumers in the real estate and other industries that have formed a "coalition to insure against terrorism" ( ciat ) .
 ( a side - by - side of the original law and the three reauthorization acts is in table 1 . ) .
however , not all insurance consumers have consistently supported the renewal of tria .
the events of september 11 , 2001 , changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible terrorism losses .
 ( see precise criteria under the tria program below. ) .
because of the lack of public data on , or modeling of , the scope and nature of the terrorism risk , reinsurers felt unable to accurately price for such risks and largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance in the months following september 11 , 2001 .
