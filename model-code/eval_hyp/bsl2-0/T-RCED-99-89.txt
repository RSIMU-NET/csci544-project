specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) trends in crashes involving large trucks , ( 2 ) factors that contribute to such crashes , and ( 3 ) omchs' activities to improve the safety of large trucks .
however , omchs is unlikely to reach the goal because ( 1 ) its initiative to target high - risk carriers for safety improvements depends on data that are not complete , accurate , or timely ; ( 2 ) several activities will not be completed before the end of 1999 ; and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of omchs' educational campaign to improve car drivers' behavior is unknown .
my testimony presents preliminary information based on our ongoing work for this subcommittee on the effectiveness of the federal highway administration's office of motor carrier and highway safety ( omchs ) in improving the safety of large trucks ( those trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or more ) .
omchs has undertaken a number of activities intended to achieve this goal , such as identifying high - risk carriers for safety improvements and educating car drivers about how to share the road with large trucks .
its goal is to reduce the number of fatalities to below the 1996 level of 5,126 — substantially less than the projected figure of 5,800 .
while many factors outside omchs' authority — such as the use of safety belts by car occupants and states' actions — influence the number of fatalities that result from crashes involving large trucks , the federal highway administration has established a goal for 1999 of reducing these fatalities .
if this trend of increasing truck travel continues , the number of fatalities could increase to 5,800 in 1999 and to more than 6,000 in 2000 .
while trucks are involved in fewer crashes per mile traveled than are cars , crashes involving trucks are more likely to result in a fatality .
although no definitive information on the causes of crashes involving large trucks exists , several factors contribute to these crashes .
in summary , of the nearly 42,000 people who died on our nation's highways in 1997 , about 5,400 died from crashes involving large trucks .
of these factors , errors on the part of car drivers are cited most frequently as contributing to crashes involving large trucks .
i am here today to discuss the safety of large commercial trucks on our nation's highways .
these contributing factors include errors on the part of car and truck drivers , truck driver fatigue , and vehicle defects .
this represents a 20 percent increase from 1992 .
at the same time , the annual number of miles traveled by large trucks increased by a similar proportion .
in 1997 , 98 percent of the fatalities from crashes between trucks and cars were occupants of the car .
specifically , errors by car drivers were reported in 80 percent of the crashes , while truck driver errors were reported in 28 percent of the crashes .
while these activities could have a positive effect on truck safety issues over the long term if effectively implemented , omchs is not likely to reach its goal for 1999 .
this is because ( 1 ) its initiative to target high - risk carriers for safety improvements depends on data that are not complete , accurate , or timely , ( 2 ) major components of several activities will not be completed before the end of 1999 , and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of omchs' educational campaign to improve car driver behavior is unknown .
