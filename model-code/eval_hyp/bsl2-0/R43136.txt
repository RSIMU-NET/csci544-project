in the 113 th congress , senator lautenberg reintroduced the reported bill as s. 696 .
the safe chemicals act ( sca ) , s. 847 , was reported by the senate committee on environment and public works in the 112 th congress .
a few weeks later , senator lautenberg and 14 co - sponsors introduced a second comprehensive bill , the chemical safety improvement act ( csia ) , s. 1009 .
in 1976 , president gerald r. ford signed the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) , giving the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) authority to regulate production and use of industrial chemicals in u.s. commerce in the interest of protecting health and the environment from unreasonable risks .
thirty - seven years of experience with tsca implementation and enforcement have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to tsca's core provisions in title i .
this crs report compares key provisions of s. 696 and s. 1009 with provisions of tsca title i ( 15 u.s.c .
2601 et seq. ) .
for a summary of tsca provisions and history , see crs report rl31905 , the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) : a summary of the act and its major requirements , by [author name scrubbed] .
based on hearing testimony , a diverse set of stakeholders generally concur that tsca needs to be updated , although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions .
legislation to amend tsca title i was introduced in the 111 th and 112 th congresses .
that would be affected if either bill became law .
these provisions are summarized in tables 1 through 6 of this report .
s. 1009 also would amend tsca title i provisions significantly but without adding most of the new provisions in s. 696 .
however , s. 696 would amend or delete most of the original title i provisions and would make substantial additions to the current statute .
for example , provisions related to testing would remain in section 4 , requirements for notifying epa when a new chemical or new use is proposed would remain in section 5 , and regulatory authorities would remain in section 6 .
also unaffected would be changes to tsca title i that were enacted during the 110 th congress , such as a provision that bans exports of elemental mercury .
neither s. 1009 nor s. 696 would affect titles ii through vi of tsca ( except that s. 696 would change the definition of "asbestos" in title ii ) , nor would they change the basic organization of tsca title i .
some key differences between the current statute and the bills are summarized in the following sections .
also included in the framework would be procedural rules for safety determinations .
proposed tsca section 18 also would preempt new state prohibitions or restrictions for any high - priority and low - priority substance .
s. 1009 would direct epa to impose various restrictions on high - priority chemicals that do not meet the safety standard for the intended conditions of use .
s. 696 would eliminate the itc provisions as well as the provision at tsca 5 ( b ) ( 4 ) .
