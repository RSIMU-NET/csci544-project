however , some stakeholder groups have raised concerns that reduced payment rates in non - bid areas have disrupted beneficiary access to needed dme items and such issues may be exacerbated in rural areas because some suppliers have limited their service areas .
to achieve savings and address improper payment concerns , congress — through the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 — directed that cms change the way it pays for dme and other items in certain areas of the country by implementing a competitive bidding program ( cbp ) .
cms estimates that about half of dme items furnished to medicare ffs part b program beneficiaries are furnished to beneficiaries residing in non - bid areas , and the reduced rates after adjustment in non - bid areas will save the medicare program about $3.6 billion between fiscal years 2016 through 2020 .
cms officials told us adjusted rates in non - bid areas have also helped limit fraud by making dme a less lucrative target for fraud and abuse , and may also have curbed unnecessary utilization of certain dme .
medicare , a federal health insurance program administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , spent about $6.4 billion in 2016 on fee - for - service ( ffs ) payments for durable medical equipment ( dme ) .
these adjustments reduced payment rates for almost all affected dme items in non - bid areas .
however , both we and the hhs office of inspector general have reported that medicare and its beneficiaries sometimes paid higher than market rates for various dme items , and there were long - standing concerns about the high rates of improper payments related to dme .
beginning january 1 , 2016 , the patient protection and affordable care act required cms to use payment information from the cbp to adjust ffs payment rates ( hereafter referred to as adjusted rates ) in all non - rural and rural areas of the united states that are not included in the cbp ( hereafter referred to as non - bid areas ) .
we have previously found that cms's implementation of the cbp decreased expenditures for both medicare and beneficiaries residing in designated cbp areas as a result of lower payment rates and decreased utilization .
this underscores the importance of cms's continued monitoring activities .
however , some stakeholders we interviewed continued to express concerns that lower ffs payment rates may have made it more difficult for some beneficiaries to receive needed dme , and one dme trade organization told us some decreases in utilization could be attributed to beneficiaries opting to pay for items outright rather than going through medicare .
because there is only limited experience on changes in the number of dme suppliers and utilization of dme based on the first year that adjusted rates have been in effect , some effects may take longer to appear , and it is possible that trends could differ in 2017 or subsequent years .
 ( see appendix i for information about cms's cbp and antifraud initiatives. ) .
we did this to evaluate the effect reduced payment rates may have had on the number of suppliers in the context of broader health industry developments and cms antifraud efforts that were not limited to rate - adjusted items , such as the implementation of new safeguards to better screen medicare suppliers .
