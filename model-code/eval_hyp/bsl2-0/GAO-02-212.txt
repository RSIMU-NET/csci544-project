more specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) compare irs' performance in providing accessible and accurate telephone assistance in the 2001 tax filing season with the 2000 tax filing season and 2001 performance targets and ( 2 ) assess irs' efforts to determine the factors that affected performance in the 2001 tax filing season and its plans to evaluate the actions it took to improve performance .
for years , congress has been concerned about the quality of service taxpayers received when calling the internal revenue service ( irs ) for help in understanding and meeting their tax obligations .
irs has taken steps intended to improve how it responds to the tens of millions of telephone calls received each year , such as expanding the hours of service and increasing the use of automation .
to address these objectives , we collected and analyzed data on eight telephone assistance performance measures: four on taxpayers' ability to gain access to irs and four on the accuracy of irs's response to taxpayers .
in the 2000 tax filing season , the quality of telephone assistance was mixed and below irs' long - term goal of providing world - class service .
however , as we previously reported to you , irs has continued to struggle to provide accessible and accurate telephone assistance .
irs' goal is to make its telephone operation a “world - class customer service organization” that provides taxpayers with accessible and accurate assistance comparable to the best practices in the private and public sectors .
because of your continuing interest in the quality of irs' telephone assistance , you asked us to assess the performance and management of irs' telephone operations in the 2001 tax filing season .
our scope and methodology are discussed in greater detail in a separate section of this report .
the interviews included surveys of the 10 field directors responsible for managing irs' 26 call sites , which employ about 10,000 telephone assistors .
we also interviewed irs officials involved in managing telephone operations and obtained and analyzed supporting documentation .
we recognize that some analyses can be costly ; however , some of the missed opportunities were low - cost and some involved key factors affecting actions taken to improve performance .
considering irs' limited progress , it cannot afford to miss opportunities without determining the most effective use of its resources to improve performance .
even so , irs missed opportunities to do other analyses of the factors affecting performance including actions to improvement it .
in addition , there are costs in not using the 10,000 assistors as effectively as possible .
when compared with 2001 performance targets , irs did not meet any of its accessibility goals .
irs missed some opportunities to better understand the factors that affected performance and to plan evaluations of the actions it took to improve performance .
table 1 compares irs' actual 2000 performance levels with its 2001 performance levels and targets .
to speed progress toward its long - term goal , irs managers need to identify the causes for performance , plan strategies to improve performance , and evaluate how well those strategies worked .
although it met or exceeded the 2001 quality targets , irs did not meet the current year's higher targets for providing taxpayers with correct responses .
