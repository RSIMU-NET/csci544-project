the obama administration's financial regulatory reform proposal of 2009 included many of the proposed elements , giving many — but not all — of these responsibilities to the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( fed ) .
using the administration's plan as a starting point , congress enacted the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( h.r .
the dodd - frank act was a broad - based reform package that included provisions affecting almost every part of the financial system .
finally , it discusses parts of the dodd - frank act involving the fed and systemic risk , including the creation of a financial stability oversight council ; regulation of systemically significant firms ; resolution authority ; modifications to the fed's emergency lending authority and new disclosure requirements ; the consumer financial protection bureau ; the regulation of payment , clearing , and settlement systems and activities ; and limits on proprietary trading .
in the wake of the recent financial crisis , many commentators have called for systemic risk or "macroprudential" regulation to help avoid future crises .

it then identifies the fed's existing powers and responsibilities for systemic risk regulation at the time of the crisis .
this report discusses only those provisions related to systemic risk or the federal reserve , found mostly in titles i and xi of the act .

the federal reserve system is self - financing ; without changing the law , congress cannot adjust its budget to influence its priorities .
adding specific systemic risk authority to the fed's current wide - ranging remit , which some see as enabling the fed to justify any action by pointing to some part of its mission , broadens the fed's already wide - ranging authority and may enhance arguments that the broad mandate hampers effective oversight .
a systemic risk regulator's authority to act could be made very broad and open ended to cover all contingencies , or it could be made more narrow to limit discretion and curb "mission creep," increasing the likelihood that once a risk is identified , additional legislative action would be needed to respond to it .
assuming that the fed's mandate provides it with systemic risk authority , the law seems not to have offered any clear - cut mechanism to discipline the fed for failure to prevent a systemic event — other than congressional intervention by amending federal law .
policymakers can manage systemic risk only if the sources of systemic risk can be identified and regulated .
proponents argue that financial regulatory reform should feature a new mandate to regulate systemic risk .
the council's duties include collecting information on financial firms from regulators and through the office of financial research , which is created in title 1 , subtitle b to support the council ; monitoring the financial system to identify potential systemic risks ; proposing regulatory changes to congress to promote stability , competitiveness , and efficiency ; facilitating information sharing and coordination among financial regulators ; making regulatory recommendations to financial regulators , including "new or heightened standards and safeguards" ; identifying gaps in regulation that could pose systemic risk ; reviewing and commenting on new or existing accounting standards issued by any standard - setting body ; providing a forum for the resolution of jurisdictional disputes among council members .
