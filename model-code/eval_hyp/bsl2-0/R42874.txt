it also participates in three presidential development initiatives , the global climate change ( gcc ) initiative , feed the future ( ftf ) , and the global health initiative ( ghi ) , and hosts u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) and u.s. drug enforcement agency ( dea ) regional offices and the usaid - administered west africa trade hub .
ghana has also drawn u.s. attention because of its recent discovery of sizable oil reserves and its potential contributions to global and u.s. energy security .
energy production may boost national income and development prospects , but may also pose good governance and resource management challenges , as is common in oil - rich developing countries .
ghana is viewed as having achieved substantial progress in its socio - economic development , despite many remaining challenges .
it has built a relatively robust democracy and a growing economy , although it faces persistent , widespread poverty and a range of profound development challenges .
the hub activities seek to expand intra - regional and bilateral trade with west african countries , a focus of renewed congressional interest and a key pillar of the obama administration's june 2012 u.s. strategy toward sub - saharan afric a .
ghana's regional stability and international peace efforts have dovetailed with those of the united states , which has often sought to support regional solutions to regional political crises and to mitigate the effects of conflict in west africa by providing large amounts of humanitarian assistance .
commitment to constitutional governance has become increasingly ingrained , as illustrated by successful inter - party transfers of state power following close recent national elections .
ghana , which last held national elections in early december 2012 ( see below ) , is considered a model for many of the outcomes that congressional and executive branch policy - makers have long sought to achieve in the region under diverse programs that have drawn substantial congressional engagement .
ghana's government has helped to mediate several armed civil conflicts in west africa in recent decades and has hosted refugees fleeing such crises .
ghana has received a large u.s. millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) compact and may soon receive a second one .
still , critics contend that it has taken insufficient action to counter such acts .
then - president george w. bush also traveled there , in 2008 , and members of congress regularly visit ghana , which is widely seen as a key u.s. partner in west africa and as an african success story .
shared interest in countering such trafficking is a growing area of u.s. - ghanaian cooperation .
in fy2013 , it met or greatly exceeded the minimum score on 18 out of 20 millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) policy performance criteria that are prerequisites for mcc compact eligibility .
ghana is the only sub - saharan african country to which mr. obama has thus far traveled while serving as president .
ghana is a steady contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations , both in africa and elsewhere , and is a recipient of u.s. training and assistance aimed at supporting such deployments .
these include its positive mcc scores and compact completion record ; potential synergies between the expected second mcc compact and other u.s. assistance programs ; and increases in other types of u.s. - ghanaian engagement , including private sector business deals .
