because charities have increasingly turned to vehicle donation programs to raise funds , interest has been raised regarding how these programs operate .
today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the vehicle donation process , ( 2 ) the amount of proceeds received by selected charities and commercial fund - raisers , ( 3 ) donor tax deductions , and ( 4 ) taxpayer guidance and cautions .
according to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , an increasing number of charities are turning to vehicle donations as an effective way to raise money .
other charities we spoke with estimated that vehicle donations made up from less than 1 percent to about 98 percent of their respective budgets .
in order to make informed decisions about these donations , however , taxpayers should be aware of how vehicle donation programs operate , the role of charities and third - party fund - raisers in the vehicle donation process , and irs rules and regulations regarding allowable tax deductions .
we plan to conduct a nation - wide survey of charities to determine their use of vehicle donation programs , and the importance of the programs to their operations .
the vehicle donations deductions lowered taxpayers' income tax liability by an estimated $654 million of the $1 trillion tax liability reported on returns .
the tax code generally allows taxpayers to deduct vehicle donations and other noncash contributions from their federal taxes if the donations go to certain qualified organizations such as churches and most nonprofit charitable , educational , and medical organizations .
one charity reported that starting a vehicle donation program helped it avoid a potential deficit after it had to cancel a major fund - raising event due to the events of september 11 , 2001 .
the vehicle donation deductions totaled an estimated $2.5 billion of the $47 billion in noncash contributions claimed .
accordingly , you asked us to describe how vehicle donation programs work , as well as information taxpayers should be aware of when donating their vehicles .
to determine how vehicle donation programs work , we also interviewed officials of irs , 10 states , 17 charities , 4 fund - raisers , and 5 related interest groups .
there is no national data identifying the percentage of charities that operate vehicle donation programs , or the number of third - party fund - raisers that solicit donated vehicles on charities' behalf .
the proceeds from vehicle donations can be an important , and sometimes crucial , source of support for charities .
second , vehicle processing and fund - raising costs are subtracted from vehicle revenue , further reducing proceeds .
because of the number of charities that are involved in vehicle donation programs , irs and other organizations have issued guidance on steps potential donors should consider before donating their vehicles to charity and claiming associated tax deductions .
of the 129 million individual returns filed for tax year 2000 , an estimated 0.6 percent , or 733,000 returns , had tax deductions for vehicle donations .
in addition , in 2001 irs created a cross - functional donated property task force to study issues surrounding donated property , including vehicle donation programs , and identify methods to monitor this area .
