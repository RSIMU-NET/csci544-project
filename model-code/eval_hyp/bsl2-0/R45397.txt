in developing poverty - related legislation and conducting oversight on programs that aid the low - income population , policymakers may be interested in these historical trends .
the spm includes the effects of taxes and in - kind benefits ( such as housing , energy , and food assistance ) on poverty , while the official measure does not .
however , the official measure provides a comparison of the poor population over a longer time period , including some years before many current anti - poverty assistance programs had been developed .
over the past several decades , criticisms of the official poverty measure have led to the development of an alternative research measure called the supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) , which the census bureau also computes and releases .
the poverty rate ( the percentage that were in poverty ) , fell from 12.7% in 2016 , while the number of persons in poverty showed no discernible change .
because some types of tax credits are used to assist the poor , as are other forms of assistance , the spm may be of interest to policymakers .
however , in addition to the most recent year's data , this report presents a historical perspective as well as information on poverty for demographic groups ( by family structure , age , race and hispanic origin , and work status ) and by state .
in 2017 , approximately 39.7 million people , or 12.3% of the population , had incomes below the official definition of poverty in the united states .
while this official measure is often regarded as a statistical yardstick rather than a complete description of what people and families need to live , it does offer a measure of economic hardship faced by the low - income population: the poverty measure compares family income against a dollar amount called a poverty threshold , a level below which the family is considered to be poor .
most of the comparisons discussed in this report are year - to - year comparisons .
the census bureau releases these poverty estimates every september for the prior calendar year .
this report only considers a number or percentage to have changed from the previous year , or to be different from another number or percentage , if the difference has been tested to be statistically significant at the 90-percent confidence level .
in this report , the numbers and percentages of those in poverty are based on the census bureau's estimates .
statistics comparing the official measure with the spm are provided at the conclusion of this brief .
historically notable lows occurred in 1973 ( 11.1% ) and 2000 ( 11.3% ) .
poverty rate peaks occurred in 1983 ( 15.2% ) , 1993 ( 15.1% ) , and 2010 ( 15.1% ) .
criticisms of the official measure have led to the development of the supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) .
the number in poverty and the poverty rates are shown from the earliest year available ( 1959 ) through the most recent year available ( 2017 ) .
because the total u.s. population has grown over time , poverty rates are useful for historical comparisons because they control for population growth .
