federal requirements relevant to independence and balance include ( 1 ) the criminal financial conflict - of - interest statute ( 18 u.s.c .
you expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest on panels convened by the board to assess health risk assessment issues .
208 ) and related u.s. office of government ethics ( oge ) regulations that prohibit federal employees from participating in a “particular matter” in which they have a financial interest and ( 2 ) the federal advisory committee act , which requires , among other things , balancing viewpoints represented on government committees and providing information about committee activities to the public .
as agreed with your office , we determined whether the policies and procedures of the board are adequate to ensure that ( 1 ) its peer review panelists are independent and the panels are properly balanced and ( 2 ) the public is sufficiently informed about the points of view represented on the panels .
peer review panels should also be properly balanced , allowing for a spectrum of views and appropriate expertise .
to be effective , peer review panels must be — and also be perceived to be — free of any significant conflict of interest and uncompromised by bias .
through such peer reviews , epa and the board seek to enhance the quality and credibility of the agency's highly specialized products .
since its inception in 1978 , the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) science advisory board has reviewed key scientific studies and methodologies used by the agency in formulating rules to protect the environment and public health .
these policies and procedures are the responsibility of epa's science advisory board staff office , which reports to the administrator and provides logistical and administrative support to the science advisory board under the leadership of a staff director .
the financial conflict - of - interest statute is applicable to the board's panelists because they are hired as special government employees .
the board comprises more than 100 nongovernment experts and provides technical advice directly to the epa administrator primarily on the basis of its peer reviews — that is , critical evaluations by panels of independent experts .
to determine how the board addresses these requirements , we reviewed the written policies and procedures developed by the staff office and also examined their application to four peer review panels you asked us to examine — three on epa's draft revised guidelines for assessing cancer health risks and one on a health risk assessment of the chemical 1,3-butadiene .
according to the director of the staff office , these panels are generally representative of board peer review panels both in subject matter — they address a significant risk assessment methodology and a health risk assessment — and in the processes used in establishing and conducting them .
we did not , however , make independent judgments on whether conflicts of interest existed for members of the four panels or assess whether these panels were properly balanced .
we reviewed the confidential financial disclosure forms of the panelists , along with other information , and discussed with staff office officials the office's policies and procedures generally as well as how they were applied to the four panels .
