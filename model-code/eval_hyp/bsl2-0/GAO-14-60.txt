pervasive financial and related business management systems and control weaknesses have adversely affected dod's ability to control costs ; ensure basic accountability ; anticipate future costs and claims on the budget ; measure performance ; maintain funds control ; prevent and detect fraud , waste , and abuse ; address pressing management issues ; and prepare auditable financial statements .
these issues led gao to designate dod financial management as high risk since 1995 .
the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2010 requires that dod develop and maintain the financial improvement and audit readiness ( fiar ) plan , which includes , among other things , the specific actions to be taken and costs associated with correcting the financial management deficiencies that impair its ability to prepare timely , reliable , and complete financial management information and ensuring that its financial statements are validated as ready for audit by september 30 , 2017 .
since dod management relies heavily on budget information for day - to - day management decisions , the dod comptroller designated the statement of budgetary resources ( sbr ) as an audit priority .
over the years , we have reported on the army and other dod efforts to overcome long - standing financial management weaknesses that have prevented the issuance of auditable financial statements .
the u.s. army is the largest component within the department of defense ( dod ) , accounting for about $189 billion or 30 percent of dod's total reported expenditures for fiscal year 2013 .
consequently , efforts to develop and implement this fip will significantly affect the army's ability to achieve audit readiness .
dod has been unable to prepare auditable information for department - wide financial statements as required by the government management reform act of 1994 .
budgetary resources and financial activity ( e.g. , obligations and expenditures ) associated with these processes represent significant portions of amounts reported on the army's general fund sbr .

the army's approach for achieving general fund sbr audit readiness is intended to integrate various interrelated efforts to improve business processes and systems and includes separate fips for budget execution , military pay , financial reporting , and fund balance with the army's fip for budget execution is particularly treasury ( fbwt ) .important as it addresses improvement efforts across multiple business processes , including funds distribution , contracts , temporary duty travel , miscellaneous payments , government purchase cards , supply , reimbursements , and civilian pay .
the secretary of defense underscored the department's sbr priority with an october 2011 memorandum directing the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) to provide a revised plan for achieving audit readiness of the sbr by september 30 , 2014 , with the aim to provide dod managers with auditable general fund information to track spending , identify waste , and improve dod's business processes .
subsequently , the ndaa for fiscal year 2013 amended the legal requirement to add that the fiar plan's financial management improvement efforts should also support the goal of validating the audit readiness of dod's sbr no later than september 30 , 2014 .
specifically , the guidance provides a standard , multiphased methodology that dod components are required to follow in developing and implementing financial improvement plans ( fip ) .
