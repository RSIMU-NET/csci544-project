more recently , several aviation industry groups have asserted that faa's processes for carrying out these functions continue to result in variation in decisions and inefficiencies , which can result in delays and higher costs for their members .
to do so , we addressed ( 1 ) the extent of variation in faa's interpretation of standards with regard to the agency's certification and approval decisions and ( 2 ) key stakeholder and expert views on how well the certification and approval processes work .
faa issues certificates and approvals based on the evaluation of aviation industry submissions against standards set forth in federal aviation regulations and related faa guidance documents .
studies published over the last 14 years have asserted that inconsistencies or variation in faa's interpretation and application of the regulations and guidance hinders the efficiency of the certification and approval processes .
the federal aviation administration ( faa ) is responsible for aviation safety , in part by issuing certificates for new air operators , new aircraft , and aircraft parts and equipment , as well as granting approvals for such things as changes to air operations and aircraft , and the design and production of aircraft parts and equipment .
you asked us to examine faa's processes for the certification and approval of national airspace users and products .
to fulfill these objectives , we reviewed relevant studies , reports , and faa documents and processes and , with the assistance of the national academy of sciences , convened a panel of aviation industry and other experts on december 16 , 2009 .
 ( see app .
we also interviewed trade groups and certificate and approval holders of various sizes that represented a broad range of aviation industry sectors â€” including air carriers , repair stations , and manufacturers .
selected with the goal of obtaining a balance of perspectives , the panel included faa senior managers ; officials representing large and small air carriers , aircraft and aerospace product manufacturers , aviation services firms , repair stations , and aviation consultants ; and academicians specializing in aviation and organization theory .
because the number of certification and approval applications is likely to increase for nextgen technologies , achieving more efficiency in these processes will help faa better manage this increased workload , as well as its current workload .

to ensure that faa actions contribute to more consistent decisions and more efficient certification and approval processes , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the administrator of faa to take the following two actions: determine the effectiveness of actions to improve the certification and approval processes by developing a continuous evaluative process and use it to create measurable performance goals for the actions , track performance toward those goals , and determine appropriate process changes .
to the extent that this evaluation of agency actions identifies effective practices , consider instituting those practices agency wide .
panelists' concerns about variation in decisions included instances in which approvals are reevaluated and sometimes revised or revoked in faa jurisdictions other than those in which they were originally granted .
experts on our panel generally noted that serious problems with the certification and approval processes occur less than 10 percent of the time .
