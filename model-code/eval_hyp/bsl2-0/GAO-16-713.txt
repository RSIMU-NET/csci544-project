nmmss is managed by the department of energy's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a separately organized agency within doe that is responsible for the management and security of the nation's nuclear weapons , nonproliferation , and naval reactors programs .
for both objectives , we reviewed the text of u.s. agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation ( nuclear cooperation agreements ) .
to enable it to demonstrate to its foreign partners that foreign - obligated nuclear material is used in compliance with peaceful use provisions , the u.s. government relies on the nuclear materials and management safeguards system ( nmmss ) as its system to track such material and report material balances to foreign partners .
jointly funded by doe and the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , the nuclear regulatory body of the united states , nmmss is the u.s. government's official database for tracking nuclear material inventories , material balances , and transactions in the united states .
the united states must generally account for nuclear material — such as uranium and plutonium — that has been obtained under agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the united states and its foreign partners .
the agreements generally impose certain terms and conditions on transfers of nuclear material and equipment , including adequate physical protection , application of safeguards , and peaceful use .
the agreements' peaceful use provisions mean that foreign - obligated nuclear material in the united states cannot be used for military purposes .
this report examines ( 1 ) the number of exchanges involving foreign obligated nuclear material that have taken place in the united states since 2003 and the reasons for the exchanges and ( 2 ) how doe and nrc ensure accurate tracking and reporting of obligation exchanges through nmmss .
we also reviewed portions of the administrative arrangements for implementing these agreements that relate to obligation accounting and reporting for four key u.s. nuclear trading partners: australia , canada , the european atomic energy community ( euratom ) , and japan .
these entities include facilities licensed by nrc , which are private companies involved in the commercial production of and research on nuclear energy , as well as academic institutions .
the annual obligation inventory reports enable the united states to demonstrate compliance with its nuclear cooperation agreements and provide assurance to foreign partners that their nuclear material is being used only for peaceful purposes , according to nnsa officials .
under these agreements , the u.s. government tracks the amounts , locations , and uses of imported nuclear material and periodically reports this information to its foreign partners .
the united states relies on nmmss to track nuclear material as it is imported to , exported from , or moved within the united states and to process about 1 million transaction records each year .
questions have been raised about the practice of obligation exchanges , including about the reliability and integrity of certain nmmss data , which are used to demonstrate compliance with nuclear cooperation agreements .
the u.s. government relies on nmmss as its accounting system for tracking and reporting of foreign obligated material .
the united states had 22 nuclear cooperation agreements in force as of june 2016 .
