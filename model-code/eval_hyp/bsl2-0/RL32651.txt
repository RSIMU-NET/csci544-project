in addition , congress has enacted otherintellectual property legislation that incorporates provisions shielding researchers from infringementliability .
this provision , enacted as part of 1984 legislation known as the hatch - waxman act , ( 91 ) applies to firms seekingto market generic equivalents of brand - name products .
however , it should be noted that the patentact of 1952 includes a limited statutory experimental use privilege for patents on pharmaceuticals,medical devices , and certain other products regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
the existence , possible scope and importance of the common law experimental use privilegein patent law remains the subject of considerable debate .
this report considers these topics in turn .
many wto members , including germany , ( 126 ) japan ( 127 ) and the united kingdom , ( 128 ) already incorporatesuch a privilege into their patent statutes .
should congressional interest continue in this area , a variety of options are available .
whether the patent law's experimental use privilege should be retained as a narrowlyconfined doctrine of limited availability , or expanded to encompass additional experimentalactivities , technologies , and researchers , continues to be the subject of active discussion in thescientific and legal communities .
alternatively , congress could enact legislation confirming the narrowlycabined view of the experimental use privilege as set forth in madey v. duke university andpredecessor cases .
a limited experimental use privilege may best encouragetechnological advancement by rewarding successful researchers with patent rights that are not easilycircumvented .
if thecurrent scope of the common law experimental use privilege is deemed to be appropriate , then noaction need be taken .
however , some commentators believe that the circumscribed nature of theexperimental use privilege may in fact restrict researcher access to state - of - the - art technologies andthus discourage further technological development .
if reform of the experimental use privilege is deemed prudent , however , another possibilityis the introduction of some additional form of the experimental use privilege into the patent act of1952 .
this infringement exemption could supplement or replace the narrow experimental useprivilege introduced by the hatch - waxman act .
consideration of any sort of statutory reform with respect to experimental use privilegeshould take into account the agreement on trade - related aspects of intellectual propertyrights .
yet another option is to grant anexperimental use privilege in favor of universities or non - profit research institutions , but retain thecurrent law of experimental use with respect to for - profit enterprises .
one option is to incorporate a generally applicableprivilege of the sort contemplated by the proposed , but unenacted patent competitiveness andtechnological innovation act of 1990 .
in addition , this bill would have limited the remedies that theowner of a patent on genetic diagnostic testing could obtain during infringement litigation .
a more limited statutory experimental use privilege presents another law reform option .
following its introduction in the 107th congress on march 14 , 2002 , h.r .
other intellectualproperty statutes , including the plant variety protection act , semiconductor chip protection act,and the vessel hull design protection act , also provide examples of the manner in which agenerally applicable statutory experimental use privilege could be drafted .
