more specifically , this report provides information and observations on ( 1 ) the extent of defense contractor participation in the program , ( 2 ) the amount of money that has been recovered , ( 3 ) the time taken to close cases , ( 4 ) the most common type of disclosures , and ( 5 ) the extent of overlap between voluntary disclosures and qui tam actions .
dod and department of justice policies and practices , along with statutory and court restrictions , precluded our access to many individual case files , negating our ability to fully evaluate the program .
in response to your request , we developed information on the department of defense's ( dod ) voluntary disclosure program , a program to encourage defense contractors to voluntarily disclose potential civil or criminal procurement fraud to the government .
acceptance into the program has its benefits for contractors .
total dod contracting for goods and services over $25,000 in fiscal year 1994 amounted to $118 billion .
the number of voluntary disclosures under the program has been relatively small and the dollar recoveries have been modest .
from its inception in 1986 through september 1994 , dod reported that 138 defense contractors made 325 voluntary disclosures of potential procurement fraud , of which 129 have been closed .
for example , a contractor can expect ( 1 ) its liability in general to be less than treble damages , ( 2 ) action on any suspension to be deferred until after the disclosure is investigated , ( 3 ) the overall settlement to be coordinated with government agencies , ( 4 ) the disruption from adversarial government investigations to be reduced , and ( 5 ) the information may be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law and regulation .
the program also benefits the government .
since that time , dod procurement - related qui tam actions have steadily increased , while voluntary disclosures have decreased .
according to dod , 48 of the top 100 defense contractors made 222 disclosures .
the remaining 103 disclosures were made by 90 contractors from among the more than 32,000 contractors doing business with dod .
twenty - five contractors reportedly did business of $1 billion or more , 147 contractors did $100 million or more , and almost 6,000 contractors did $1 million or more .
the justice department pointed out that the program promotes corporate compliance with laws and regulations .
for example , dod commented that the existence of a structured format for addressing contractual and legal violations encourages contractor ethics and internal review programs .
in fiscal year 1994 , the number of contractors doing business with dod did not substantially change .
in response to the 1986 report , a number of defense contractors established self - governance programs that included monitoring compliance with federal procurement laws and voluntarily disclosing violations to government authorities .
other reasons cited for a contractor not making a voluntary disclosure include ( 1 ) contractor management conflicts between disclosing potential fraud to the government and the contractor's perceived duty to protect stockholder value ; ( 2 ) contractor uncertainty of prosecution outcome from disclosing potential fraud ; ( 3 ) the high cost of internal investigations , which is usually stipulated to be an unallowable cost for government reimbursement purposes ; and ( 4 ) differences between contractor disclosure policies and its practices .
