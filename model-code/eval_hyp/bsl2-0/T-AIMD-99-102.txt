we have made many recommendations to reduce those risks ; however , blm has been slow to implement some recommendations and has not yet fully implemented others .
we have previously reported on the significant problems and risks that blm has encountered .
in addition , to reduce the risk that future efforts will result in similar failures , blm should assess its information technology investment practices and systems acquisition capabilities .
mr. chairman , blm spent over 15 years and estimates that it invested about $411 million planning and developing the almrs / modernization , only to have the major software component — known as the almrs initial operating capability ( ioc ) — fail .
as you requested , i will discuss ( 1 ) the history of the project , ( 2 ) the results of our reviews , including the key reasons for problems , and ( 3 ) where we believe blm should go from here .
the almrs / modernization was intended to provide modern computer and telecommunications equipment and office automation for over 200 offices nationwide as well as software to more efficiently record , maintain , and retrieve land description , ownership , and use information to support blm , other federal programs , and interested parties .
the bureau now needs to determine whether it can salvage any of the more than $67-million reported investment in almrs ioc software , by analyzing the software to determine if it can be cost - beneficially modified to meet blm's needs .
thank you for inviting us to participate in today's hearing on the bureau of land management's ( blm ) automated land and mineral record system project , also known as the almrs / modernization .
as a result of that failure , the bureau decided not to deploy almrs ioc at this time .
we performed our work from july 1998 through february 1999 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
until such assessments are completed and corrective action taken , blm should not undertake any sizable systems acquisition or development efforts .
blm has been slow to implement some of our recommendations and has not yet fully implemented others .
these problems indicate the need for blm to ensure that the deficiencies in its systems acquisition capabilities and processes are acknowledged and corrected .
in addition , to reduce the risk that future information technology efforts will result in a similar outcome , blm should assess its investment management practices and its systems acquisition capabilities .
in addition , the lack of a configuration management program , security plan and architecture , and operations and maintenance plans further increased blm's risks .
until these assessments and subsequent improvement actions are taken , blm will not be adequately prepared to undertake any sizable system acquisition .
blm did not develop a credible project schedule or develop adequate transition plans .
our reports have discussed these issues , their causes , and our recommended corrective actions .
mr. chairman , since may 1995 we have reported many problems and risks that threatened the successful development and deployment of the almrs / modernization .
this analysis should be part of an overall effort to identify and assess all viable alternatives , including ( 1 ) using or modifying almrs ioc software , ( 2 ) modifying or evolving existing land and recordation systems , ( 3 ) acquiring commercial , off - the - shelf software , or ( 4 ) developing new systems .
