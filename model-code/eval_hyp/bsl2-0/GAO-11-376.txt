usda and the food and drug administration ( fda ) both have federal regulatory and oversight responsibilities to , among other things , help ensure the food industry's compliance with preventive measures designed to reduce or eliminate foodborne , disease - causing organisms , known as pathogens .
in recent years , usda's commodity program has purchased over $1 billion worth of about 180 commodities annually , including raw ground beef , poultry , and mozzarella cheese , and offered them to schools .
schools taking part in the programs receive cash subsidies and food provided at no cost , known as “commodities,” from the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .
virtually all food for sale in the commercial marketplace is subject to federal regulation and oversight , including testing for pathogens by federal inspectors and setting limits on the levels of pathogens detectable in certain foods .
agencies within usda regulate the production of meat , poultry , and processed egg products , and fda issues regulations to ensure the safety of all other foods , including fruits , vegetables , milk , and whole - shell eggs .
in addition , under an agreement between usda and the department of defense ( dod ) , schools may choose to receive fresh produce , such as apples , lettuce , and baby carrots , purchased by dod for the commodity program .
accordingly , our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which federal purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for food in the commodity program differ from federal regulations for the same foods available in the commercial marketplace ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the commodity program's purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for raw ground beef differ from those imposed by some large federal and private - sector purchasers ; and ( 3 ) examples of standards and practices that exist at the state and school district level to help ensure that food procured by schools is safe .
like the rest of the nation's food supply , the food served in schools is generally safe , although vulnerable to microbial contamination that can result in illnesses , ranging from relatively mild to life - threatening or even fatal conditions .
some of these specifications are designed to prevent harmful pathogens and limit the allowable level of certain bacteria that indicate poor sanitary handling or preparation conditions in specific commodities .
many of these same foods have also been associated with foodborne illness , such as raw ground beef .
the national school lunch and school breakfast programs are federally assisted programs that provide low - cost or free meals to more than 30 million children each school day in over 100,000 schools nationwide .
to address these objectives , we obtained documentation of usda's purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for food in the commodity program , discussed these specifications with federal officials , as well as with knowledgeable groups and individuals — including representatives of industry associations and consumer groups — and compared the specifications with federal regulations for food sold in the commercial marketplace .
in addition , large purchasers of food , such as grocery store and restaurant chains , may include in contracts with their suppliers specifications designed to prevent , reduce , or eliminate microbial contamination .
