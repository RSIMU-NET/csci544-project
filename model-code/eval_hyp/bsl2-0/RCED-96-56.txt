this cleanup effort is also one of doe's most expensive projects ; its estimated life - cycle cost is $36 billion .
because of characterization's importance to the cleanup and safe storage of the wastes , our objectives were to ( 1 ) review doe's progress in meeting the deadlines , ( 2 ) identify any impediments to making progress , and ( 3 ) determine what impact continued delays could have .
the last formal schedule revision took place in january 1994 , when doe negotiated an agreement with washington state and the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to finish characterization by september 1999 .
also in january 1994 , doe agreed to implement a recommendation by the defense nuclear facilities safety board to characterize wastes in the 54 tanks with known or suspected safety problems by october 1995 .
at hanford , the characterization program has experienced a series of delays , leading to numerous revisions in the schedule for completing the work .
doe's program for developing a safe , permanent way to dispose of the waste in these tanks is one of its highest priorities .
the department of energy ( doe ) has about 55 million gallons of highly radioactive waste currently stored in 177 underground tanks at its hanford site in washington state .
some of these tanks have leaked , and others contain potentially flammable waste .
characterization , the first major step in cleaning up tank wastes , involves determining the specific contents of the tanks through sampling and other means .
inadequate management attention has impeded solutions to these problems .
2 ) .
these concerns have been expressed by regulators , advisory bodies , and other persons involved with the remediation effort .
doe and westinghouse have made limited progress in meeting the agreed - upon deadlines for characterization .
if the information proves to be inadequate , further technical problems and cost overruns are likely , jeopardizing the success of the overall program and increasing the potential that funds may be used unwisely .
however , their reliability is largely untested .
while many factors have contributed to the slow pace of the characterization effort , the primary reasons for slow progress are that ( 1 ) doe and westinghouse have not yet determined how to successfully draw reliable samples and characterize the waste and ( 2 ) managerial weaknesses with the characterization program and other aspects of the tank farms have exacerbated delays and contributed to operational inefficiencies .
furthermore , these uncertainties could undermine the savings doe expects to realize by privatizing the tank waste remediation program .
in september 1995 , doe acknowledged that the tri - party agreement and safety board characterization deadlines could not be met and proposed a two - phased approach for characterizing tank wastes that would extend characterization activities well beyond 1999 .
despite some recent improvements in sampling capability , westinghouse remains behind schedule in taking samples from the tanks .
the september 1995 characterization proposal , while more in line with what doe can realistically expect to accomplish in the next several years , has generated concerns about whether it will provide sufficient characterization information to proceed with remediation efforts .
doe's current proposal raises questions about whether enough characterization information will be available to build effective facilities for retrieving the wastes and preparing them for permanent disposal .
