provisions addressing the legislative branch revolving funds have been included in the annual and supplemental appropriations bills as well as authorizing legislation .
in recent years , legislation has been enacted ( 1 ) establishing , consolidating , and repealing legislative branch revolving funds ; ( 2 ) modifying the use of the funds ; ( 3 ) requiring the deposit of receipts associated with some activities while prohibiting expenses associated with others ; ( 4 ) limiting obligational authority ; ( 5 ) allowing a temporary transfer between accounts ; and , in the case of the government publishing office , ( 6 ) providing an appropriation to the fund .
while some of the revolving funds legislation has been focused primarily on financial management , revolving funds have also been amended in response to new programs or activities ( for example , the capitol visitor center act ) or broader changes in congressional organization ( for example , the u.s. capitol police and library of congress police merger implementation act ) .
over time , the revolving funds have grown in number and size , undergone numerous reorganizations and legislative amendments , and been subject to the oversight of congressional committees and audits and investigations by the government accountability office ( gao ) .
these publications may provide additional information , including the current status of the fund and recent revenues and expenditures .
while revolving funds may receive additional budget authority from the legislative branch appropriations bills , the appropriations measures are generally not the primary means of support .
while amounts in those bills are generally available for the fiscal year , unless otherwise specified , amounts in many of the funds are available without fiscal year limitation .
the period of availability for amounts in revolving funds also differs depending upon the budget authority provided in the annual appropriations bills .
they may be established for a number of reasons , including a desire ( 1 ) to provide separate accounting for transactions between agencies or business - type transactions , ( 2 ) to isolate and simplify accounting for a single activity , or ( 3 ) to increase flexibility and efficiency of operations .
the legislative branch currently has 27 revolving funds , including eight funds for the house of representatives , nine for the senate , five for the architect of the capitol , four for the library of congress , and one for the government publishing office .
authority to spend funds is provided for in law .
receipts generated from revolving fund transactions are returned to the individual funds and may be expended without further congressional action , although expenditures are confined to authorized uses .
over time , congress has revisited their use , structure , and solvency ; conducted oversight through hearings and the review of audits ; and considered legislation amending the revolving funds , either through proposals offered by members or at the request of legislative branch agencies .
revolving funds are generally intended to operate on a self - sustaining basis with funds retained in the account rather than returned to the u.s. treasury .
this report traces the establishment , use , and recent development of these funds .
where applicable , the report refers to publications that provide further details on individual revolving funds .
