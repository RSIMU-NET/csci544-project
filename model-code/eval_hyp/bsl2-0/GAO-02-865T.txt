to prepare this testimony , we reviewed ( 1 ) the reorganization and reprogramming documents submitted by the department of justice ( doj ) to this subcommittee on may 29 , 2002 ; ( 2 ) our prior work on organization transformation and on the fbi ; ( 3 ) studies of counterterrorism and / or fbi operations conducted by various commissions , an advisory panel , doj's office of inspector general , and a management consultant ; ( 4 ) strategic plans and other related documents developed by the bureau and doj ; and ( 5 ) pertinent press releases and congressional testimony by doj and fbi officials .
second , i will comment on major aspects of the fbi's approach to realign its resources , touching on both the promise of these efforts and the challenges yet to be faced .
first , it is very important to recognize that the fbi's reorganization efforts represent a subset of a larger need to fundamentally transform the federal government in light of recent trends and long - range fiscal challenges .
finally , i want to emphasize the importance of congressional oversight to the successful implementation of transformational changes like those planned by the fbi .
this transformation should include a review , reassessment and reprioritization of what the government does , how it does business , and who does the government's business .
third , i will surface other issues important to the success of the plan that are not specifically addressed in this phase of the fbi's reorganization .
fourth , as the fbi moves forward , i want to underscore the importance of adherence to some basic elements needed to ensure a successful transformation .
i appreciate the opportunity to discuss the federal bureau of investigation's proposed reorganization and realignment efforts .
we also interviewed selected current and former justice and fbi officials concerning the reorganization and its context .
we did our work between may 30 , 2002 and june 20 , 2002 .
my testimony today will address five topics .
since september 11 , unprecedented levels of fbi resources have been devoted to counterterrorism and intelligence initiatives with widespread public approval .
the key elements of this second installment of the reorganization include a shifting of some resources from long - standing areas of focus , such as drugs , to counterterrorism and intelligence ; building analytic capacity ; and recruiting to address selected skill gaps .
these earlier actions were to strengthen the fbi's top - level management structure , enhance accountability , reduce executive span of control , and establish two new divisions for records management and security .
indeed , the goals of this phase of the reorganization plan are not highly controversial .
these proposed changes are designed to build on the initial reorganization actions director mueller took in december 2001 .
as you know , our country's transition into the 21st century is characterized by a number of key trends including global interdependence ; diverse , diffuse , and asymmetrical security threats ; rapidly evolving science and technologies ; dramatic shifts in the age and composition of our population ; important quality of life issues ; and evolving government structures and concepts .
however , some specific aspects of the plan should be highlighted .
