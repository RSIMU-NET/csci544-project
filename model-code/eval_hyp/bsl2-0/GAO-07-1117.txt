cms also stated that educating beneficiaries with kidney failure is critical to improving beneficiaries' ability to actively participate in and make informed decisions about their care .
transplant failures may be particularly problematic for pediatric recipients because long - term dialysis can lead to developmental problems , such as inhibited growth , as well as poor academic performance and delayed social development .
pediatric transplant recipients may be more likely than their adult counterparts to lose access to immunosuppressive medications once medicare coverage for esrd ends because they may lack access to other health insurance coverage .
§ 426-1 ( 2000 ) .
as a result , the agency engages in numerous educational and outreach efforts targeted to beneficiaries , providers , and national organizations that represent renal patients .
the usrds is a national data system maintained by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) national institutes of health ( nih ) that contains data on individuals with esrd collected from many sources , including hhs's centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency that administers medicare , and the united network for organ sharing .
while a lack of health insurance is one reason transplant recipients may stop taking their medication , studies have reported that there are numerous other reasons for medication noncompliance , including avoidance of adverse side effects associated with immunosuppressive medications and difficulty following complex treatment regimens .
unless a transplant recipient is eligible for medicare other than because of esrd , coverage of immunosuppressive medications , along with follow - up care , ends 36 months posttransplant .
generally , individuals with esrd are eligible for benefits under medicare if they ( 1 ) are entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act ( or an annuity under the railroad retirement act of 1974 ) , ( 2 ) meet certain work requirements under the social security or railroad retirement programs , or ( 3 ) are the spouse or dependent child of a person who meets at least one of the first two requirements .
in this report , we ( 1 ) compare certain demographic characteristics and types of health insurance coverage of pediatric , transitional , and adult kidney transplant recipients ; ( 2 ) examine the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent outcomes — retransplant , dialysis , or death — among pediatric , transitional , and adult kidney transplant recipients ; ( 3 ) determine how the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent outcomes of kidney transplant recipients compare by type of health insurance coverage ; and ( 4 ) examine how the cost to medicare for a beneficiary with a functioning transplant compares with the cost for a beneficiary with a transplant failure .
cms stated that it was concerned about the quality of care and the outcomes experienced by medicare beneficiaries , including the higher rate of transplant failure among transitional patients .
while there are many reasons that could account for transplant failures during the first 3 years posttransplant — including medication noncompliance — the large percentage increase in transplant failures from 1 year to 3 years posttransplant for transitional recipients cannot be attributed to an inability to access immunosuppressive medications due to a lack of medicare coverage .
