ceq regulations for implementing nepa , among other provisions , introduced additional levels of environmental review — those for environmental assessments ( eas ) and categorical exclusions .
with regard to the latter , certain federal actions such as highway construction projects and permitting for mining operations , cattle grazing , forest thinning , and energy development projects may trigger compliance with literally dozens of statutory and regulatory requirements .
in recent years , the time it takes to comply with various environmental laws has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate in congress .
one law that has been the subject of particular scrutiny has been the national environmental policy act of 1969 ( nepa ; 42 u.s.c .
one agency that tracks all its projects is the department of transportation's ( dot ) federal highway administration ( fhwa ) .
to implement the national policy , nepa requires that environmental factors be considered when federal agencies make decisions and that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the human environment .
this debate is likely to continue if additional streamlining methods are proposed by agencies implementing their own nepa procedures .
§§ 4321-4347 ) .
factors that may contribute to delays in a federal project include changes in the planning and design process , changes in funding priorities , construction complexities , local controversy or community opposition to a project , and compliance with myriad local , state , tribal or federal laws .
these , in turn , may require the participation or input of possibly dozens of local , state , tribal , or federal agencies .
the degree to which additional streamlining provisions will be included in legislation enacted by the 110 th congress is unclear .
no regulatory or legislative definition of streamlining exists .
in 2005 , fhwa reported that just over 84% of all highway projects were classified as categorical exclusions ( representing just over 81.5% of fhwa project funding ) , 9% required an ea ( 5.5% of project funding ) , and approximately 7% required an eis ( 13% of project funding ) .
environmental groups are concerned that by speeding up the compliance process and reducing emphasis on concerns of "non - lead" agencies , streamlining will have the result of weakening environmental protections .
as a result of the debate between stakeholders regarding nepa's implementation , numerous administrative and legislative actions have been proposed to expedite compliance with nepa .
signed into law by president nixon on january 1 , 1970 , nepa declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a council on environmental quality ( ceq ) in the executive office of the president .
listed by federal agency , the following websites and crs products provide additional information ( available as of december 6 , 2007 ) regarding environmental compliance issues and agency streamlining activities .
the "detailed statement" referenced in the law is now known as an environmental impact statement ( eis ) .
stakeholders , such as industry representatives who would like to see their projects implemented more quickly , often feel that the authority of lead agencies must be strengthened to reduce delays caused by potential disagreements among agencies and that hard deadlines must be set and enforced .
