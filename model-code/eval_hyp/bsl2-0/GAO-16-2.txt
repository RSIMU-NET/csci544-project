in fiscal year 2015 , congress appropriated $11.5 billion in federal idea , part b funds to help defray the excess costs of educating children with disabilities .
however , with the 2008 recession , state and local governments around the country faced record budget shortfalls , raising concerns about school districts' ability to comply with the moe requirement .
to be eligible for these funds , school districts must meet certain conditions , including what is called local maintenance of effort ( moe ) .
under the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) , administered at the federal level by the department of education ( education ) , states are required to make a free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities .
in this report we examined what is known about ( 1 ) the extent to which school districts face challenges meeting moe and why , ( 2 ) how the moe requirement has affected services for students with and without disabilities in selected school districts , and ( 3 ) how well education and the states have facilitated compliance with the local moe requirement .
in 2011 , we surveyed school districts as part of our work on the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) and found an estimated 24 percent predicted that they would have trouble meeting moe in the 2011-12 school year .
local moe generally requires that school districts spend at least the same amount of money on the education of children with disabilities that they spent in the preceding fiscal year .
over 6 million children receive special education services each year through a combination of federal , state , and local funding .
to obtain information at the federal level , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , policy , and guidance and interviewed education officials .

to address these objectives , we used a variety of methodologies .
increased efficiencies .
the key challenges in meeting moe that districts cited involved state and local budget or cost reductions , which are not among the allowable exceptions for districts to reduce spending .
in light of these findings , you asked us to examine districts' recent experiences with moe .
 ( see app .
research has shown that state funding for elementary and secondary education has been slow to recover from the 2008 recession and that long - term budget challenges are likely to persist .
however , we have also found that without sufficient flexibility , these requirements can reportedly have adverse effects on state and local governments by distorting state and local priorities , penalizing spending reductions arising from fiscal crisis or increased efficiencies , and discouraging program innovation and expansion .
we also reviewed comments submitted in response to education's september 2013 notice of proposed rulemaking ( 2013 nprm ) and searched the federal audit clearinghouse for audit findings related to local moe compliance .
we selected these states to represent diversity on a number of factors that could affect districts' ability to meet moe , such as recent changes in state funding for elementary and secondary education and the number of districts in the state that anticipated having trouble meeting moe in our 2011 survey .
