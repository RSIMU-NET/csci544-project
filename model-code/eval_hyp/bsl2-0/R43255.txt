thus , an understanding of the mental health workforce may be helpful in crafting legislation and conducting oversight for overall mental health care policy .
policymakers have demonstrated interest in the federal government's broad role in mental health care .
they have done so primarily by holding hearings and introducing legislation addressing the interrelated topics of quality of mental health care , access to mental health care , and the cost of mental health care .
the mental health workforce is a key component of mental health care quality , access , and cost .
the federal government is involved in mental health care in various ways , including direct provision of services , payment for services , and indirect support for services ( e.g. , grant funding , dissemination of best practices , and technical assistance ) .
it is important to note that , while the federal government has an interest in the mental health workforce , and federal initiatives may affect the training of mental health care providers , for instance , most of the regulation of the mental health workforce occurs at the state level .
access to mental health care depends on the number of appropriately skilled providers available to provide care , among other things .
the cost of mental health care is affected in part by the wages of the people providing care .
it then describes three dimensions of the mental health workforce that may influence quality of care , access to care , and costs of care: ( 1 ) licensure requirements and scope of practice for each provider type in the mental health workforce , ( 2 ) estimated numbers of each provider type in the mental health workforce , and ( 3 ) average annual wages for each provider type in the mental health workforce .
the quality of mental health care , for example , is influenced by the skills of the people providing the care .
state boards determine licensing requirements for mental health professionals , and state laws establish their scopes of practice .
this report begins with a working definition of the mental health workforce and a brief discussion of alternative definitions .
the report then briefly discusses how these dimensions of the mental health workforce might inform certain policy discussions .
increasing the breadth of the mental health workforce may also increase its overall size .
the federal government may also provide incentives such as loan repayment or loan forgiveness to encourage individuals to enter mental health occupations , which are projected to grow faster than the overall workforce .
another way policymakers may influence the size of the mental health workforce ( and thus access to mental health services ) is through the provision or expansion of federal programs .
for example , the federal government may provide grants to establish or expand training programs for mental health providers .
policymakers may consider strategies to direct people into these high growth fields as part of larger labor force policy considerations .
initiatives may be targeted to certain provider types or to certain locations ( e.g. , mhpsas ) .
policymakers may also wish to consider the relative wages of different provider types , particularly when addressing domains within which the federal government employs mental health providers .
