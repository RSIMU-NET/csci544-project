my statement today focuses on ( 1 ) gao's work related to the president's management agenda , and ( 2 ) additional opportunities for decision makers to address major management challenges .
in responding to the varied and increasingly complex issues the federal government seeks to address , it faces a number of significant fiscal , management , and governance challenges .
the federal government is one of the world's largest and most diverse entities , with about $3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2013 , funding an extensive array of programs and operations .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss efforts under way to address major management challenges facing the federal government , as well as opportunities for the administration and congress to make further progress moving forward .
my comments are primarily based upon our published and ongoing work covering gao's high risk list ; fragmentation , overlap and duplication reports ; and managing for results work .
the work upon which these published reports and preliminary findings were based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
reliable financial and performance information is even more critical as ( 1 ) federal managers likely face increasingly tight budget constraints and need to operate their respective entities as efficiently and effectively as possible and ( 2 ) decision makers carry out the important task of deciding how to use multiple tools ( tax provisions , discretionary spending , mandatory spending , and credit programs ) to address the federal government's fiscal challenges .
the administration and executive branch agencies need to implement the hundreds of recommendations made by gao and agency inspectors general to address cyber challenges , resolve known deficiencies , and fully implement effective information security programs .
in addition to financial management and widespread fragmentation , overlap , and duplication issues , the federal government must address pressing challenges with its cybersecurity .
we have reported that ( 1 ) cyber threats to systems supporting government operations and critical infrastructure were evolving and growing , ( 2 ) cyber incidents affecting computer systems and networks continue to rise , and ( 3 ) the federal government continues to face challenges in a number of key aspects of its approach to cybersecurity , including those related to protecting the nation's critical infrastructure .
similarly ongoing attention is needed to address issues identified in our annual reports on fragmentation , overlap , duplication , and potential cost savings and revenue enhancements .
in february 2013 , the president issued presidential policy directive 21 on critical infrastructure security and resilience and executive order 13,636 on improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity .
however , more needs to be done to accelerate the progress made in bolstering the cybersecurity posture of the nation and federal government .
the details in our reports , along with successful implementation by agencies and continued oversight by congress , can form a solid foundation for progress to address risks , improve programs and operations , and achieve greater efficiencies and effectiveness .
congress is considering several bills that are intended , if enacted into law and effectively implemented by the executive branch , to improve cyber information sharing and the cybersecurity posture of the federal government and the nation .
