states rely on these revenues to fund education and infrastructure projects and to assist local counties where the oil production occurs .
for example , in fiscal year 2006 , the department of the interior's minerals management service ( mms ) , which collects royalties from federal lands , distributed more than $303 million to the states , with california's share totaling over $44.7 million , or roughly 15 percent of the total state disbursements .
despite a history of self - reliance in petroleum supplies , california crude oil production has been declining since 1996 , and california increasingly relies on oil from other states and countries .
crude oil is a globally traded commodity , so natural and geopolitical events worldwide can affect its prices .
crude oil price differentials are generally not constant over time ; they reflect changes in world crude oil markets , as well as more local or crude oil specific factors .
these fluctuations can affect state revenues because a share of the royalty payments collected from companies that lease state or federal lands to produce crude oil are distributed to the states .
there are currently three widely used crude oil benchmarks â€” west texas intermediate ( wti ) , brent , and dubai .
because much of the oil produced in california is heavy and sour , california refiners have made significant investments in more technically complex equipment that enables them to process these crudes into higher value products such as gasoline , jet fuel , and diesel .
as agreed with your office , this report discusses ( 1 ) the extent to which crude oil price differentials in california have fluctuated over the past 20 years and ( 2 ) the factors that may explain the recent changes in the price differential between california and other crude oils .
consequently , oil producing states typically monitor crude oil price fluctuations and are interested in ensuring that the crude oil produced in their state trades at a fair price in the marketplace .
we also interviewed officials from the energy information administration ( eia ) , mms , and the california energy commission ( cec ) .
california currently produces about 37 percent of the crude oil it uses , with the remainder coming largely from alaska , saudi arabia , mexico , ecuador , and iraq .
for example , if wti is selling for $60 per barrel and kern river ( a california crude oil ) for $45 per barrel , the wti - kern river price differential is $15 .
crude oils produced from different regions and geologic structures vary in important ways that also affect each crude oil's value in the marketplace .
crude oil is commonly classified according to two parameters: density and sulfur content .
california is also the nation's fourth largest producer of crude oil , behind texas , louisiana , and alaska , and has the third largest oil refining industry , behind texas and louisiana .
specifically , the value of a given crude oil is determined by its inherent quality and the amount and value of petroleum products that can be refined from it .
a benchmark crude oil is typically an abundantly produced and frequently traded crude oil .
