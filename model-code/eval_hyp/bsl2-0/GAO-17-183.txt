dod has made progress by developing and implementing its strategies for improving asset visibility .
additionally , the 2015 strategy states that dod has made significant progress toward improving asset visibility , but opportunities for greater dod - wide integration still exist .
the 2014 strategy outlined initiatives intended to improve dod's asset visibility .
until dod components demonstrate that implementation of the initiatives will result in measurable outcomes and progress toward achieving the goals and objectives of the strategies , dod may be limited in its ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective actions and resolving the high - risk area .
we are making two recommendations to help improve dod's asset visibility .
we also reported that dod needed to assess and refine , as appropriate , existing performance measures to ensure that these measures assessed the implementation of individual initiatives as well as progress toward achieving the strategy's goals and objectives .
in december 2015 , we reported that dod had updated its 2014 strategy in october 2015 ( 2015 strategy ) , and had taken numerous actions to address weaknesses in its 2014 strategy .
however , dod's efforts to monitor initiatives show that the performance measures dod components currently use to assess these initiatives lack some of the key attributes of successful performance measures that we have identified .
dod has focused on improving asset visibility since the 1990s , and its efforts have evolved over time , as shown in figure 1 .
we reported that dod had made considerable progress from 2013 to 2015 in addressing the four remaining criteria through actions such as developing the department's framework for improving asset visibility , known as its 2014 strategy for improving dod asset visibility ( 2014 strategy ) .
additionally , dod linked the 2015 strategy's goals and objectives with the specific initiatives intended to implement the strategy .
developing clear , quantifiable , objective , and reliable performance measures can help dod better assess department - wide progress against the strategies' goals and clarify what additional steps need to be taken to enable decision makers to exercise effective oversight .
dod also identified performance measures for its asset visibility initiatives .
to the extent that these measures lack the key attributes of successful performance measures , they limit dod's ability to effectively monitor the implementation of the initiatives and assess the effect of the initiatives on the overall objectives and goals of the strategies .
dod components have identified performance measures for the 8 initiatives we reviewed , but the measures do not generally include the key attributes of successful performance measures ( i.e. , the measures were not generally clear , quantifiable , objective , and reliable ) .
dod has issued two strategies to guide its efforts in improving asset visibility: 2014 strategy: in january 2014 , the department issued its strategy for improving dod asset visibility .
dod has taken some positive steps to address weaknesses in asset visibility .
the 2015 strategy states that the department introduced automatic identification technology capabilities to improve its ability to track assets .
in this report , we address the extent to which dod has ( 1 ) identified performance measures that allow it to monitor the progress of selected asset visibility initiatives identified in its strategies and ( 2 ) addressed our five criteria — leadership commitment , capacity , corrective action plan , monitoring , and demonstrated progress — for removing asset visibility from our high risk list .
