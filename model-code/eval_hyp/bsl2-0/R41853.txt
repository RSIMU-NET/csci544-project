a more passive approach by congress could involve states implementing the ssuta without congressional approval .
in the 113 th congress , s. 743 , approved by the senate on may 6 , and s. 336 ( senator enzi and others ) and their house counterpart h.r .
in hopes of stemming the potential loss of tax revenue , several states are participating in an initiative to simplify and coordinate their tax codes — called the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ( ssuta ) .
s. 1832 ( senator enzi and others including senator durbin ) would have granted ssuta member states and non - member states that met less rigorous simplifications standards the authority to compel out - of - state vendors to collect sales and use taxes .
state enforcement of remote collection would likely face legal challenges , and the outcome of these legal challenges is uncertain .
state and local governments are concerned that the expansion of e - commerce , which was estimated to reach approximately $3.9 trillion in 2012 , is gradually eroding their tax base .
the impact of congressional action ( or inaction ) on the remote collection issue will vary significantly by state .
congress has a role in this issue because interstate commerce , in most cases , falls under the commerce clause of the constitution .
684 ( representative womack and others ) would grant ssuta member states and non - member states that meet less rigorous simplifications standards the authority to compel out - of - state vendors with greater than $1 million in remote sales to collect sales and use taxes .
3179 ( representative womack ) would have also granted states the authority to compel out - of - state vendors to collect use taxes provided selected simplification efforts were implemented .
this concern arises in part because the u.s. supreme court ruled out - of - state vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which they ( the vendors ) do not have nexus .
congress may be asked to consider taking an active role in the debate .
state governments rely on general sales and use taxes for just under one - third ( 31.7% ) of their total tax revenue — approximately $223 billion in fy2010 .
local governments derive 11.0% of their tax revenue — approximately $62 billion in fy2010 — from general sales and use taxes .
compliance with this requirement , however , is quite low .
the member states hope that congress could be persuaded to allow them to require out - of - state vendors to collect taxes from resident customers .
this report intends to clarify significant issues in the remote sales tax collection debate , beginning with a description of state and local sales and use taxes .
2701 ( senator durbin and representative conyers ) would have granted ssuta member states the authority to compel out - of - state vendors in other member states to collect sales and use taxes .
consumers are required to remit use taxes to their taxing jurisdiction for the use of the product purchased .
previously , in the 112 th congress , s. 1452 and h.r .
alternatively , use taxes , levied at the same rate , are often not collected by the vendor if the vendor does not have nexus ( loosely defined as a physical presence ) in the consumer's state .
