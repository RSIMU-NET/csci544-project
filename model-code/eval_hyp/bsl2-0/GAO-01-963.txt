you requested that we assess the pace and quality of the district's effort to renovate and modernize its public schools — an effort expected to cost $1.3 billion over 10 years .
the district was faced with a substantial amount of deferred maintenance , which contributed to safety problems such as fire code violations and leaky roofs .
most of the schools were over 50 years old and had not been well - maintained .
it focuses specifically on the district of columbia school system's use of an areawide utility contract for gas and energy management services between the general services administration ( gsa ) and the washington gas light company ( washington gas ) to renovate the schools .
by mid - 1997 , the condition of the district of columbia's public schools had reached crisis proportions .
it has budgeted $1.3 billion for the renovations from fiscal year 1998 through 2007 .
this is the first in a series of reports responding to your request .
in response to public concerns about safety and maintenance , the district of columbia undertook a major effort to renovate and modernize its public schools in 1998 .
we looked at whether the school system properly used and administered this contract .
establishing and following strong management and oversight practices is critical to successful contracting efforts .
in the fiscal year 1999 district of columbia appropriations act , congress authorized the corps of engineers to provide the school system with engineering , construction , and related services .
further , the counsel explained that energy management services must result in documented energy cost savings or a reduction in energy usage .
it also lists many energy management projects that are not regulated utility services that could be provided under areawide contracts , such as window and air conditioning replacements .
in addition , until fiscal year 2001 , the district of columbia's office of contracting and procurement was required to review contracting actions ( including the school system's ) totaling $50,000 or more .
we are sending a separate letter to gsa detailing our concerns with its guidance and providing recommendations on improving oversight and guidance on areawide utility contracts .
the agreement was for engineering , procurement , and technical assistance to ensure that construction contracts were awarded and managed so that schools could open in the fall of that year .
for example , district agencies are required to perform procurement planning and conduct market surveys to promote and provide for competition for supplies and services .
however , the school system will need to make a concerted effort to ensure that they are quickly and effectively implemented and sustained throughout future renovation contracts .
until fiscal year 2001 , the district of columbia's office of contracting and procurement was the central authority for procurements made by the various city agencies , including the school system .
the “energy management” services available from the contract could , if the contractor has these services on file with the public service commission , include services intended to provide energy savings , efficiency improvements , energy audits , conservation measures such as lighting control and boiler control improvements , and water conservation device installation .
