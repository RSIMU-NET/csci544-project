noaa , with the aid of the national aeronautics and space administration noaa , with the aid of the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , is planning to procure the next generation of geostationary ( nasa ) , is planning to procure the next generation of geostationary satellites , called the geostationary operational environmental satellites - r satellites , called the geostationary operational environmental satellites - r series ( goes - r ) .
the goes - r series is to replace the current series of series ( goes - r ) .
programs are not repeated .
and intensity of these storms once they develop .
they also provide the best means to identify severe storm conditions , such as hurricanes and tornadoes , and to track the movement conditions , such as hurricanes and tornadoes , and to track the movement and intensity of these storms once they develop .
these satellites — which are managed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) — provide the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) — provide critical information on atmospheric , oceanic , climatic , and solar critical information on atmospheric , oceanic , climatic , and solar conditions that help meteorologists observe and predict global and local conditions that help meteorologists observe and predict global and local weather events .
specifically , we were asked to ( 1 ) determine the status of and plans for the goes - r series procurement , and ( 2 ) identify status of and plans for the goes - r series procurement , and ( 2 ) identify and evaluate the actions that the program management team is taking to and evaluate the actions that the program management team is taking to ensure that past problems experienced in procuring other satellite ensure that past problems experienced in procuring other satellite programs are not repeated .
the goes - r series is to replace the current series of satellites which will likely begin to reach the end of their useful lives in satellites which will likely begin to reach the end of their useful lives in approximately 2012 .
they also provide the best means to identify severe storm weather events .
these satellites — which are managed by our nation's weather forecasting .
operational geostationary environmental satellites play a critical role in operational geostationary environmental satellites play a critical role in our nation's weather forecasting .
it is also technological advance in goes instrumentation since 1994 .
to determine goes - r status and plans , we reviewed program documents to determine goes - r status and plans , we reviewed program documents on the planned acquisition schedules , cost estimates , and system on the planned acquisition schedules , cost estimates , and system requirements , and interviewed program officials .
it is also considered critical to the united states' ability to maintain the continuity considered critical to the united states' ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting through the year 2028. of data required for weather forecasting through the year 2028 .
specifically , we were asked to ( 1 ) determine the of the goes - r program .
this new series is expected to mark the first major technological advance in goes instrumentation since 1994 .
