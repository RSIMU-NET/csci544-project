further , the project experienced numerous schedule delays and cost increases .
the department of justice ( doj ) office of inspector general ( oig ) has reported numerous issues that contributed to the cost increases and delays , including poorly defined and slowly evolving design requirements , contracting weaknesses , unrealistic task scheduling , and lack of management continuity and oversight for tracking and overseeing costs effectively .
project costs , which were originally estimated at approximately $380 million , eventually escalated to approximately $537 million .
gao also reported on weaknesses in fbi's it systems development and management capabilities , including contractor oversight .
for several years congress recognized that the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) information technology ( it ) systems were archaic and inadequate for efficiently and effectively investigating criminal cases .
we also reviewed fbi policy and procedure manuals ; applicable federal regulations , including the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , federal travel regulation , and joint travel regulations ( jtr ) ; prior gao and doj oig reports on trilogy issues ; trilogy contract documents and interagency agreements ; contractor invoices ; and other documentation supporting goods provided and services rendered .
although the scheduled completion date for the overall trilogy project was june 2004 , after september 11 , 2001 , fbi required an accelerated deployment plan and moved up the expected completion dates .
the completion date for the portion of trilogy related to upgrading fbi's it infrastructure was accelerated from may 2004 to july 2002 .
while ultimately successful in providing the infrastructure update , the project was not a success with regard to upgrading the investigative applications .
our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) fbi's internal controls provided reasonable assurance that payment of unallowable contractor costs would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business , ( 2 ) fbi's payments to contractors were properly supported as a valid use of government funds , and ( 3 ) fbi maintained proper accountability for assets purchased with trilogy project funds .
initiated in mid - 2001 , trilogy — fbi's largest it upgrade to date — was intended to modernize fbi's it infrastructure and systems and provide needed applications to help fbi agents , analysts , and others do their jobs .
in addition , we conducted interviews with officials from fbi , general services administration's ( gsa ) federal systems integration and management center ( fedsim ) , department of the interior ( doi ) , and trilogy contractors .
the trilogy project consisted of two primary efforts: an it infrastructure update and an upgrade of fbi's investigative applications .
to address these objectives , we used various internal control standards and guidance as a basis to assess fbi's internal controls over the payments made with trilogy funds .
fbi recognized the need to modernize its it systems before the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , but those events underscored fbi's need to improve its ability to effectively retrieve , analyze , and share investigative information necessary to carry out its mission .
while the overall scheduled completion date for the investigative application upgrades , which became known as the virtual case file ( vcf ) , was originally june 2004 , the due date for the first vcf deliverable was accelerated to december 2003 .
