public debate has centered on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness , the extent and severity of adverse reactions experienced by vaccine recipients , and the adequacy and accuracy of the adverse reactions that have been reported .
avip has been the subject of continuing controversy from its inception .
in january 2001 , the food and drug administration ( fda ) completed an approval and licensure process , allowing the manufacturing plant to resume production of the anthrax vaccine .
this information should be of interest to dod and the congress as they consider future anthrax vaccine programs .
in addition , some gulf war veterans are suffering from unexplained illnesses that they believe might have been caused by anthrax vaccinations received during the war .
dod also stated that substantial quantities of vaccine would be reserved for civilian uses in homeland security .
as you requested , we address in this report the views of pilots and other aircrew members of the air national guard and air force reserve regarding the anthrax vaccine immunization program ( avip ) of the department of defense ( dod ) .
it was intended to be compulsory for all 2.4 million dod military service members — active duty and reserve component members , including certain designated civilian and contractor personnel .
dod temporarily restricted the mandatory anthrax program in 2000 to a very small group ( special mission individuals and researchers ) because of limited vaccine supply resulting from the closing of the vaccine manufacturing plant .
in december 1997 , the secretary of defense announced a plan to inoculate u.s. forces against the potential battlefield use of anthrax as a biological warfare ( bw ) agent .
we have reported on many of these issues ( see the list of related gao products at the end of the report ) .
dod still regards the biological agent anthrax , a disease that is usually lethal if inhaled in sufficient quantity , as the single greatest bw threat to u.s. military forces in the battlefield .
this means that unlike other mandatory vaccines routinely given to the military , avip received intense attention from high command levels and was subject to exceptional accountability requirements .
in may 2002 , dod announced the resumption of the anthrax immunization program , limiting it to “at risk” troops .
however , since most of the questions were , at the time , related to and report views on contemporaneous events ( for example , information provided in 1999 and 2000 or information about adverse reactions experienced with inoculations given before 2000 ) , we believe the results of the survey are still valid and useful as a measure of the avip program's performance .
however , the identity of the troops receiving the vaccine will not be disclosed for security reasons .
congressional concern continues about the potential effect of this program on the retention of highly trained and experienced personnel in the air national guard and air force reserve .
the perpetrator — individual , group , or other entity — responsible for sending the anthrax letters has not yet been identified .
these tragedies were followed in october 2001 by the mailing of anthrax - laced letters that killed five people in the united states .
