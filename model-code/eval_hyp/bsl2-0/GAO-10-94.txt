specifically , we address issues pertaining to ( 1 ) how bop estimates costs when developing its annual budget request to doj ; ( 2 ) the extent to which bop's methods for estimating costs follow established best practices or guidelines ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which bop's costs for key operations exceeded requested funding levels identified in the president's budget in recent years , and how this has affected bop's ability to manage its growing inmate population .
in fiscal year 2008 , doj reported to the office of management and budget ( omb ) that bop would be unable to operate at the funding levels in its appropriation because costs for key operations were at risk of exceeding appropriated funding levels .
in recent years , bop has faced challenges in meeting its operational workload responsibilities to manage this growth .
bop reported that it again anticipated a funding gap in fiscal year 2009 , and in response , congress provided appropriations above the amount requested in the president's budget .
in accordance with this explanatory statement , and in consultation with the house and senate appropriations committee staff , we are reporting on bop's methods for cost estimation , including the pricing of utilities and inmate medical care costs .
on september 10 , 2009 , we provided a briefing to staff of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on commerce , justice , science , and related agencies .
as of october 1 , 2009 , bop was responsible for overseeing a total federal inmate population of approximately 209,000 — a population which has grown by 44 percent since fiscal year 2000 .
this report responds to congressional direction in the explanatory statement accompanying the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 .
second , by improving documentation of all steps for developing its cost estimate , bop would be better positioned to re - create its estimates in the event of attrition within its budget office among those who developed initial cost estimates .
if bop identified its level of cost estimation confidence and provided this information to doj , doj could more fully understand the range of potential costs — and the potential need for more funding — if estimating assumptions for key cost drivers , such as inmate population growth , do not hold true .
the department of justice's ( doj ) federal bureau of prisons' ( bop ) mission is to protect society by confining offenders in the controlled environments of prisons and community - based facilities that are safe , humane , cost - efficient , and appropriately secure .
given bop's unique responsibility for managing this population , and its limited discretion when costs for key operations exceed funding levels , it is especially important for bop to develop accurate cost estimates and clearly convey to decision makers the potential risk of costs exceeding funding levels .
furthermore , bop officials reported , and doj officials acknowledged , that bop has already implemented significant reductions in operations costs , such as by eliminating positions and centralizing administrative functions .
this report ( 1 ) provides a summary of our briefing and ( 2 ) transmits recommendations that we are making to the attorney general of the united states .
