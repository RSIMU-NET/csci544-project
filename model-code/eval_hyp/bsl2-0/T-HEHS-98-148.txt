i will discuss ( 1 ) how much federal and state funds states are spending on child care subsidy programs and how they are allocating these resources , ( 2 ) how states are trying to increase the supply of child care to meet the projected demand under welfare reform , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states are changing standards for child care providers in response to the anticipated increased demand under welfare reform .
104-193 ) .
child care standards and enforcement practices .
recognizing the important role that child care subsidy programs play in helping low - income families support themselves through work , you asked us how those programs are changing at the state level in light of the revisions the congress made to them through the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( p.l .
our work is based on case studies of seven states' child care subsidy programs conducted between december 1996 and october 1997 ; information about the child care subsidy programs of all 50 states and the district of columbia , as described in the plans states are required to submit to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) under the personal responsibility act ; and other studies .
in fact , our previous work has suggested that child care subsidies can be an important factor in poor mothers' decisions to find and keep jobs , increasing the probability that poor and near - poor mothers will work .
however , it is too early to know how effective these efforts will be in meeting the child care needs of low - income families .
the cost of child care often creates a barrier for low - income parents attempting to support their families through work .
my testimony today is based primarily on our recent report on state child care programs .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our work on states' efforts to expand their child care subsidy programs for low - income families .
on average , funding in these states increased from about $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1996 to about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 1997 .
in response to welfare reform , the seven states we reviewed are expanding funding for child care programs .
however , states may face pressures to spend these additional resources for other tanf - related services .
however , the long - term effects of welfare reform on states' efforts to regulate child care providers and ensure that children receive quality child care are as yet unknown .
to address concerns about the safety and quality of informal child care , some states have imposed additional requirements on informal providers who receive subsidies .
states' ability to meet the anticipated increased demand for child care will depend on future levels of state child care funding as well as on changes in demand for child care subsidies resulting from welfare reform's work participation requirements .
as a result , some states are using tanf funds to fund child care subsidies .
as we previously reported , fiscal pressures could ultimately lead states to devote fewer state resources to monitoring and regulating child care providers in the future .
