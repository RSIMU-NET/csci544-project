in addition , other federal agencies have food safety programs or responsibilities .
the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food safety and inspection service has regulatory responsibility for ensuring the safety of meat , poultry , and some egg products , while the department of health and human services' food and drug administration has regulatory responsibility for all other food products .
both these agencies inspect domestic and imported food .
consequently , we have recommended consolidating federal food safety activities .
as we have reported on many occasions , this fragmented system impedes the government's ability to efficiently and effectively oversee the safety of the food supply .
outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have raised questions about the safety of the u.s. food supply and the inherent weaknesses of the fragmented federal food safety system .
all four countries are incurring short - term costs while expecting long - term benefits .
in august 1998 , the national academy of sciences also recommended consolidating food safety functions and suggested a number of approaches that could be considered , including a single food safety agency .
specifically , we ( 1 ) examined the reasons for and approaches taken to consolidation , the costs and savings , if any , associated with consolidation , and efforts to assess the effectiveness of the revised food safety systems and ( 2 ) identified the lessons that the united states might learn from these countries' experiences in consolidating their food safety functions .
we visited three countries — canada , denmark , and ireland — which have consolidated their food safety responsibilities , and one country — great britain — which is in the process of consolidating its food safety responsibilities .
none had developed performance measures and data early in the process to assess the effectiveness of their new systems .
to supplement the national academy's study , you asked us to review the experiences of foreign countries that are consolidating their food safety responsibilities .
the four countries we visited had different reasons for consolidating their food safety activities , and therefore their approaches to reorganizing food safety responsibilities also differed .
these four countries' food safety systems are discussed in detail in appendixes i through iv .
shortly after the national academy issued its report , the president established a council on food safety , which was to review and report on the academy's report in 1999 .
these illnesses cost the nation between $7 billion and $37 billion annually in medical and productivity losses .
these costs are in addition to the ongoing operational costs .
specifically , the new , consolidated agencies require additional funding to establish a fully operational food safety system , including such overhead costs as computers and telephones .
specifically , these officials believe that consolidating food safety activities would improve service delivery by providing a single contact for consumer and industry clients ; reduce overlap and the duplication of services ; improve or reduce the need to coordinate food safety activities , thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of food safety regulation ; provide more comprehensive oversight of food safety from “farm to enhance food safety , thereby providing continued access to international markets for producers and processors .
