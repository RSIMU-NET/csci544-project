in november 2005 , dhs announced the launch of sbi , a multiyear , multibillion - dollar program aimed at securing u.s. borders and reducing illegal immigration .
one component is the u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) sbi program office which is responsible for developing a comprehensive border protection system using people , technology , known as sbinet , and tactical infrastructure â€” fencing , roads , and lighting .
much of the united states' 6,000 miles of international borders with canada and mexico remains vulnerable to illegal entry .
my testimony today is the second in a series of interim reports on sbi implementation and focuses on the following issues: the extent to which border patrol agents have been trained and are using sbinet technology ; sbi tactical infrastructure implementation ; and how the sbi program office has defined its human capital goals and the progress it has made to achieve these goals .
although the department of homeland security ( dhs ) apprehends hundreds of thousands of people entering the country illegally each year , several hundreds of thousands of individuals also enter the united states illegally and undetected .
elements of sbi will be carried out by several organizations within dhs .
furthermore , future tactical infrastructure costs are not yet known because issues regarding land acquisition have not been resolved and other decisions , such as the materials to be used , have not been made .
to address these issues , we analyzed dhs documents , including program schedules and status reports , and workforce data .
in the tactical infrastructure area , although fencing projects are currently on schedule , meeting future deadlines will be challenging because of various factors , including difficulties in acquiring rights to border land .
securing the nation's borders from illegal entry of aliens and contraband , including terrorists and weapons of mass destruction , continues to be a major concern .
you requested that we monitor cbp's sbi program and provide periodic updates on the status of the program .
these issues underscore congress' need to stay closely attuned to dhs's progress in the sbi program to make sure that performance , schedule , and cost estimates are achieved and the nation's border security needs are fully addressed .
to ensure that future sbinet development efforts deliver an operational capability that meets user needs and delivers technology that can be used in additional projects , it is important that the lessons learned on project 28 continue to be applied and that user input continues to be sought so that future technology projects are successful .
finally , as mandated in the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , we are examining dhs's fiscal year 2008 expenditure plan for the sbi program and also expect to report to congress in spring 2008 .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss observations on selected aspects of the secure border initiative ( sbi ) program implementation .
specifically , we are conducting work for this committee to assess the development and deployment of sbinet's command , control , and communications systems and surveillance and detection systems and expect to issue a report later this year .
we interviewed dhs and cbp headquarters and field officials , including representatives of the sbi program office , border patrol , cbp air and marine , cbp office of field operations , and the dhs science and technology directorate .
