our testimony addresses ntsb's progress in ( 1 ) following leading practices in ment , management areas such as strategic planning , human capital manage information technology ( it ) , and financial management ; ( 2 ) increasing the efficiency of activities related to investigating accidents , issuing recommendations , and conducting safety studies ; and ( 3 ) increasing the use of its training center .
as the share of federal resources used to address the nation's long - term fiscal imbalance and other national priorities grows , funding for increases in the budgets of individual agencies becomes more uncertain .
in addition , in recent years , other entitie have conducted reviews and made recommendations to ntsb related to information security practices and financial management .

in 2006 , we conducted a broad review of the agency's management practices , examined how it carried out its activities related to accident investigations and safety studies , and analyzed whether its training center was cost - effective .
recognizing that many recommendation may take considerable time and effort to fully implement , we classified ntsb's progress in implementing a recommendation as significan agency had taken steps beyond the early planning stages toward addressing the concerns .
with a staff of about 400 and a budget of $91 million for fiscal year 2009 , ntsb is charged with investigating every civil aviation accident in the united states and selected accidents in other transportation modes , determining the probable cause of these accidents , making recommendations to address safety issues identified during accident investigations , and performing transportation safety studies .

in our analysis , we classified ntsb's progress in implementin a recommendation as limited when the agency was in the early planning stages and documents or milestones for actions did not exist or the agency did not follow leading practices .
we also visited the ntsb training center ; interviewed ntsb's chief information officer , chief financial officer , and other agency officials ; and updated information we reported in 200 2008. computers .
finally , we classified a recommendation as fully implemented when ntsb had fully implemented plans or processes that followed leading practices ntsb provided technical comments on a draft of this statement that we t from incorporated as appropriate .
