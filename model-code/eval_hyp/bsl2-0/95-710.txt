however , legislation that would amend the fha is routinely introduced in congress , including proposals to extend the act's anti - discrimination provisions to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation , gender identity , marital status , source of income , and status as a military servicemember or veteran ; and to make clear that the act does not support disparate impact discrimination claims .
it also analyzes various legal tests applied by courts to assess both intentional ( a.k.a. , disparate treatment ) discrimination and disparate impact discrimination claims brought under the act .
the fair housing act ( fha ) was enacted "to provide , within constitutional limitations , for fair housing throughout the united states. .
this report provides an overview of the types of discriminatory practices barred by the fha , as well as certain activities that are exempted from the act's coverage .
the last major change to the act occurred in 1988 when it was amended to prohibit discrimination on the additional grounds of physical and mental handicap , as well as familial status .
additionally , the report addresses several specific types of discrimination that have been the source of fair housing litigation , including how the act's proscription on discriminating against families with children interplays with housing communities for older persons ; how the prohibition against discriminating on the basis of sex can provide protections to lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) individuals who are not expressly protected under the act ; and the intersection of local zoning laws , group homes , and the fha's protections against discrimination on the basis of mental and physical disabilities .
in 1974 , the act was amended to add sex discrimination to the list of prohibited activities .
the report concludes with an overview of how the act can be enforced , as well as the potential remedies available to victims of unlawful discrimination and potential penalties that can be assessed against violators .
the original 1968 act prohibited discrimination on the basis of "race , color , religion , or national origin" in the sale or rental of housing , the financing of housing , or the provision of brokerage services .
in july 2015 , hud issued final regulations designed to implement an fha mandate that executive agencies administering hud programs , as well as hud - grantees and other recipients of hud funding , further the fha's goals of reducing segregation and housing barriers .
the rule was issued in response to recommendations expressed in a government accountability office ( gao ) report on hud's oversight of grantees' compliance with these mandates .
hud has primary administrative enforcement authority of the act , which it typically fulfills through administrative adjudications .
among other things , hud's affirmatively furthering fair housing rule requires covered entities to "identify and evaluate fair housing issues" in a standardized fashion through an "assessment of fair housing" ( afh ) plan ; incorporate housing data accumulated and publicly disseminated by hud , when establishing housing - related goals , plans , and decisions ; and allow members of the public "to provide input about fair housing issues , goals , priorities , and the most appropriate use of hud funds ...." the rule went into effect on august 17 , 2015 ; however , participants will have at least one year to submit their first afh plan , with smaller participants being given more time .
