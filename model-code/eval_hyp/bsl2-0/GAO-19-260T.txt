recognizing these and other challenges , congress statutorily mandated in 2014 that dot develop national strategies related to the sustainability of the u.s. - flag fleet , including recommendations for the future .
in the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , the statutory deadline for the national maritime strategy was extended from february 2015 to february 2020 .
my statement today provides information on ( 1 ) the status of the mandated national strategies and ( 2 ) challenges that stakeholders identified related to sustaining the u.s. - flag fleet for defense needs and options dot has considered for addressing them .
despite the msp and cargo preference requirements that have helped support the u.s. - flag fleet , concerns have been raised about the fleet's future sustainability the u.s. - flag fleet has been in decline for many years and increasingly faces difficulties in competing for international cargo due to the higher costs of operating under the u.s. flag .
we also analyzed data for fiscal year 2012 through 2017 on international cargo shipped by government agencies .
to help ensure an adequately - sized u.s. - flag fleet for defense needs , the government supports internationally - trading u.s. - flag vessels in the following ways: ( 1 ) through the maritime security program ( msp ) , which provides the operators of selected u.s. - flag vessels a stipend in exchange for their agreeing to provide sealift support in times of war or crisis , and ( 2 ) through “cargo preference” requirements that specify that federal agencies must transport certain percentages of international government cargo on u.s. - flag vessels .
notably , the number of u.s. - flagged vessels has continued to decline — from 199 vessels at the end of 1990 to just 82 vessels by the end of 2017 , creating a potential shortage of u.s. citizen mariners to crew government - owned reserve vessels in times of need .
this statement is based on our august 2018 report on challenges to sustaining u.s. - flag vessels for military needs .
for the 2018 report , we reviewed relevant laws , regulations , guidance , prior gao reports , and studies related to msp and maritime economics .
dod largely relies on internationally - trading u.s. - flag vessels ( vessels registered in the united states that must be mainly crewed by u.s. citizens ) for sealift — the process of transporting government equipment and supplies by sea for military purposes .
however , it has long been recognized that the operating costs of u.s. - flag vessels are higher than the operating costs of foreign - flag vessels , and that government support is therefore necessary to maintain a fleet of internationally trading u.s. - flag vessels .
in addition , we spoke with officials from dot , dod , and selected agencies subject to cargo preference requirements , as well as msp vessel operators , academics knowledgeable about maritime issues , and other stakeholders .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on efforts by the departments of transportation ( dot ) and defense ( dod ) to draft a national maritime strategy that addresses challenges the government faces in supporting the fleet of u.s. - flag vessels .
