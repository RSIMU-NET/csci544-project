106-541 ) authorized involvement of federal agencies in projects to restore the everglades ; these projects are coordinated under a planning framework â€” the comprehensive everglades restoration plan ( cerp or the plan ) .
water shortages , like those affecting florida in 2007 because of lower than normal rainfall , are expected to become more frequent as demand by urban and agricultural consumers increases .
south florida is also home to more than six million people and a large agricultural economy .
there is wide agreement that major changes in water quantity , quality , timing , and distribution since the 1950s have significantly altered the region's ecology .
during the dry season , the current water regime in south florida is unable to sufficiently supply freshwater to meet both natural system needs and urban and agricultural demand .
the everglades is the defining component of the south florida ecosystem ( see figure 1 ) , which incorporates 16 national wildlife refuges and four national park units .
the water resources development act of 2000 ( title vi , p.l .
other issues include effectiveness of restoration efforts and uncertainties in technologies .
recent concerns have included how projects are being prioritized , the pace of federal efforts and investments , and the pace of mitigation efforts for excess phosphorous .
while support for cerp remains broad , reservations remain over its implementation .
no cerp projects have been completed since enactment , and all 15 cerp components scheduled for completion by 2007 have been delayed .
since enactment of wrda 2000 and though fy2007 , $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been put toward cerp projects .
in the interior and related agencies appropriations act , fy2006 ( p.l .
some critics of the law argue that the plan extends previously established phosphorus mitigation deadlines and may compromise restoration efforts .
there exists serious concern that delays may jeopardize the plan's feasibility .
this interdependency of cerp and non - cerp projects for achieving ecosystem restoration goals was codified in wrda 2000 , which restricted appropriations for specific components of cerp until mod waters is complete .
the law's proponents argue that the plan represents a realistic strategy for curbing phosphorus .
federal water resources policies justify federal participation in ecosystem restoration projects , like cerp projects , based on the projects' environmental benefits for the nation .
109-54 ) , there were several provisions that conditioned funds for restoration on the achievement of water quality standards in federal properties .
another area of controversy that is related to potential delays in restoration stems from a may 2003 florida state law ( chapter 2003-12 ) that authorizes a plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution reaching the everglades .
a concern of some stakeholders is that some specific everglades restoration projects proposed for authorization or under development have primarily local benefits , rather than national benefits .
if water quality standards are not achieved , appropriations for restoration may be reduced according to provisions in these acts .
the sponsors and beneficiaries of traditional corps projects that provide navigation and flood control are concerned that not only everglades restoration but also other large - scale restoration activities , such as wetlands restoration in coastal louisiana , may divert funds away from their projects .
