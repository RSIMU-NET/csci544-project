in the event of a national emergency , the department of defense ( dod ) will face requirements for air transportation that exceed its military airlift capabilities .
to meet additional requirements , dod can use the civil reserve air fleet , aircraft from u.s. commercial air carriers voluntarily committed and put under contract to dod for use during emergencies .
as agreed with your office , we determined whether ( 1 ) program participants could respond to an activation with the required number of aircraft and crews and in the required time frame and ( 2 ) incentives used to attract and retain program participants are effective .
commercial air carriers experienced financial difficulties after the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
the commercial air carriers receive no compensation for their participation in the civil reserve air fleet unless they are activated , but they are given an incentive to participate by being made eligible to bid for dod's peacetime airlift business .
in your december 2001 letter , you expressed concern over the carriers' ability to respond to the requirements of the civil reserve air fleet program in the event of an activation for an emergency or a war , including the ability to provide crews that do not have national guard or reserve obligations .
it does not reflect the new defense planning guidance , issued in may 2002 , the new national security strategy , issued in september 2002 , or the airlift needed to meet that strategy .
the air force's air mobility command at scott air force base , illinois , manages the civil reserve air fleet program .
this study determined the airlift required to meet the former national military strategy of fighting and winning two major theater wars .
to respond to your letter , we referred to the mobility requirements study 2005 , issued in january 2001 , to determine the requirements for the civil reserve air fleet program .
air carriers are paid for missions they fly at predetermined rates based on a weighted average of their costs plus a return on investment .
dod needs to study ways to expand the use of smaller wide - body aircraft to ensure an equitable distribution of the peacetime business and determine whether smaller wide - body aircraft could carry out a higher proportion of its peacetime missions as efficiently as , and possibly more economically as , the b - 747 does .
if they are unable to see some benefit from the incentive program , some participants might reduce or end their participation in the program .
there are strong indications that some major program participants are dissatisfied with their share of a key craf incentive , the opportunity to bid on peacetime mobility business , because dod uses almost exclusively only one type of aircraft for peacetime cargo missions .
however , commercial carriers increased their commitment to 46 of these aircraft for fiscal year 2003 .
this could cause difficulties in meeting requirements at a time when participation in peacetime business or craf activation is crucial .
however , dod believed it would be more appropriate to ensure that ongoing study efforts be given greater emphasis and require that any resulting reports specifically address our issues .
