along these lines , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has helped implement several product stewardship initiatives under its resource conservation challenge .
through its purchasing decisions , the federal government has substantial leverage to enhance recycling infrastructures and stimulate markets for environmentally preferable electronic products .
the federal government is the world's largest purchaser of information technology equipment , annually spending nearly $75 billion on electronic products and services .
disposing of e - waste has become an important issue as rapidly advancing technology has led to increasing sales of new electronic products — in particular , computers , monitors , and handheld devices such as cell phones .
our testimony , which is based on our prior work and updated with data from epa , provides observations on ( 1 ) epa's electronic product stewardship initiatives , ( 2 ) the extent of federal agency participation in them , and ( 3 ) opportunities for strengthening participation .
these initiatives encourage environmentally responsible management of electronic products from “cradle to grave” — that is , from the initial procurement of environmentally preferable products , to their operation in an energy efficient manner , and finally to their reuse or recycling in an environmentally safe way .
if donated or recycled , these products may eventually be irresponsibly exported to countries without modern landfills and with waste management systems that are less protective of human health and the environment than those in the united states .
as we previously reported , if discarded with common trash , a number of adverse environmental impacts may result , ranging from the loss of valuable resources in the electronics such as copper , gold , and aluminum to the potential for harmful substances such as cadmium , lead , and mercury to enter the environment .
in our august 2008 report , we showed that e - waste exported from the united states to developing countries , such as those in southeast asia , is often dismantled under dangerous health conditions , using methods like open - air incineration and acid baths to extract precious metals .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss findings from our work on federal procurement of environmentally preferable electronic products and ways in which such procurement can lessen the impacts of electronic waste ( e - waste ) disposal .
with this increase comes the dilemma of managing these products at the end of their useful lives .
little information exists , for example , on whether obsolete electronic products are reused , stored , or disposed of in landfills .
the federal government has the opportunity to lead by example and to leverage its substantial market power by broadening and deepening agency and facility participation in epa electronic product stewardship initiatives , but meaningful results will only occur if federal agencies and facilities fully participate and utilize these promising initiatives' resources .
our prior work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives .
however , many of the environmental and human health problems associated with e - waste disposal can be averted through environmentally preferable procurement .
