heightened military presence in an internationally recommended transit corridor in the gulf of aden has reduced attacks in that area , but pirates have adopted tactics that now allow them to attack more than 1,000 nautical miles off the somali coast .
as of march 2011 , somali pirates had been sighted as far east as off the coast of india , and as far south as the mozambique channel .
the number of attacks in this area , which had roughly doubled annually from 2007 to 2009 , rising from 51 reported attacks to 217 , appeared to level off in 2010 , when 219 attacks were reported .
