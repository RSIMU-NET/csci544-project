to shed light on the possible impacts of such an agreement , you asked us to ( 1 ) describe the social security administration's ( ssa ) processes for developing the proposed agreement with mexico , ( 2 ) explain how the agreement might affect the payment of social security benefits to mexican citizens , and ( 3 ) assess ssa's cost estimates for such an agreement .
over the last year , the united states has been negotiating a totalization agreement with mexico that has received considerable attention among the media and others regarding its potential impacts .
because mexicans represent a large share of the millions of unauthorized workers present in the united states , a totalization agreement with mexico has raised concerns that many such workers would become newly eligible for social security benefits at a time when long - term trust fund solvency is threatened .
since 1977 , the united states has entered into 20 totalization agreements .
first , the agreements eliminate dual social security taxes that multinational employers and their employees must pay when they operate and reside in countries with parallel social security programs .
second , the agreements help to fill gaps in benefit protection for persons who have worked in different countries for portions of their careers .
to address these objectives , we reviewed existing totalization agreements and the laws governing them ; interviewed and obtained key documentation from ssa , department of state , and mexican embassy personnel ; and reviewed a range of demographic data and estimates addressing mexican immigration .
totalization agreements foster international commerce and protect benefits for persons who have worked in foreign countries in two ways .
we also examined ssa's actuarial cost estimates and supporting documentation for the proposed mexican agreement .
we conducted our work between january and august 2003 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
finally , current solvency issues require the congress to think carefully about future trust fund commitments resulting from totalization agreements .
still , all agreements include some level of uncertainty and require due diligence on ssa's part to alleviate those uncertainties .
furthermore , a common border and economic disparity between the united states and mexico have fostered significant and longstanding unauthorized immigration into the united states , making an agreement with mexico potentially far more costly than any other .
having more timely and complete information on the benefits , costs , and risks associated with each agreement can only serve to better inform their decisions .
ssa's processes for entering into these agreements have been informal and have not included specific steps to assess and mitigate potential risks .
totalization agreements allow such workers to combine ( totalize ) work credits earned in both countries to meet minimum benefit qualification requirements .
totalization agreements between the united states and other countries often foster enhanced diplomatic relations and provide mutually beneficial business , tax , and other incentives to employers and employees affected by these agreements .
thus , for the mexican agreement , additional analyses to assess risks and costs may be called for .
a revised approach for entering into totalization agreements with all countries would enhance the quality of information provided to the congress , which is tasked with reviewing these vital long - term commitments .
