although force management levels may be part of the input as plans are developed , and may be taken into account as existing plans are assessed and updated , they may also have the effect of essentially reversing the planning order and establishing resource limits that dod planners and commanders need to adjust to or work around as they develop and execute their plans .
force management levels limit the number of u.s. military personnel deployed to a given region and have been a factor in military operations at least since the vietnam war .
force management levels have also been used in the past to shape the drawdown of operations in afghanistan and iraq .
currently , in afghanistan and in the fight against the islamic state of iraq and syria , u.s. forces are deployed under force management levels set by the administration .
my statement today discusses some of the actions dod has taken to maximize military capabilities when operating under a force management level in its ongoing operations .
for iraq and syria , the lead inspector general for overseas contingency operations reported that , as part of operation inherent resolve , the united states authorized an additional 615 troops in september 2016 , bringing the total authorized forces in support of that operation to 5,262. , while force management levels have long been used as a policy tool to shape and direct the deployment of u.s. military forces , they can present a unique challenge to military planners .
in june 2016 , the president announced the force management level for afghanistan is 9,800 .
also in 2014 , congress passed and the president signed legislation authorizing dod to provide assistance , including training and equipment , to vetted syrian opposition forces to fight isis , among other purposes .
similar to u.s. efforts in afghanistan , u.s. military operations in iraq shifted focus from combat and counterinsurgency to that of an advising and training role for iraqi security forces .
thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss some of the actions the department of defense ( dod ) has taken to maximize military capabilities while operating under force management levels in ongoing operations .
the focus is on defining the military mission and developing and synchronizing plans to accomplish that mission .
similar legislation authorized assistance to military and other security forces of or associated with the government of iraq , including kurdish and tribal security forces or other local security forces with a national security mission .
among the actions dod has taken to accomplish these goals in afghanistan , iraq , and syria is that of increasing its reliance on: ( 1 ) partner nation security forces ; ( 2 ) u.s. and coalition airpower ; ( 3 ) special operations forces ; and ( 4 ) contractor and temporary duty personnel .
u.s. government efforts for the global war on terrorism in iraq began in 2003 with operation iraqi freedom .
this statement is based on our body of work on dod's contractor oversight , its use of advise and assist teams , key enablers in operations , and other gao reports .
under joint doctrine , the joint operational planning process consists of a set of logical steps to examine the mission ; develop , analyze , and compare courses of action ; select the best course of action ; and produce a plan or order .
