you asked us to review issues related to campus climate surveys on sexual violence and efforts by federal agencies to help colleges develop and implement these surveys .
this report examines ( 1 ) what key stakeholders view as the strengths and limitations of using campus climate surveys to examine the incidence and characteristics of sexual violence on college campuses ; ( 2 ) what approaches selected colleges have used to survey their students about the incidence of sexual violence on campus ; and ( 3 ) what role federal agencies play in helping colleges develop and implement campus climate surveys on sexual violence .
due to concerns about underreporting of sexual violence to law enforcement , some researchers have administered surveys to gather additional information regarding sexual violence , such as estimating its prevalence on college campuses .
measuring the prevalence of campus sexual violence , however , has proven difficult .
these surveys may include questions about students' experiences with sexual violence , knowledge of the college's policies and procedures for reporting incidents , and perceptions about how well campus authorities and local law enforcement handle reports of sexual violence .
however , estimates from these types of studies can vary widely due to factors such as differing survey methodologies , response rates , and metrics .
data collected by the department of education ( education ) from colleges under the jeanne clery disclosure of campus security policy and campus crime statistics act ( clery act ) indicate that an estimated six sex offenses per 10,000 college students were reported to law enforcement or campus security authorities in 2016 , but research shows that traditional crime statistics like these tend to understate rates of sexual violence .
in 2014 , a white house task force recommended that colleges voluntarily begin using campus climate surveys to help examine campus sexual violence .
in recent years , colleges across the country have conducted campus climate surveys focused on the issue of sexual violence .
specifically , we reviewed surveys developed by the association of american universities ( aau ) , the administrator research campus climate collaborative ( arc3 ) , and the department of justice ( justice ) .
victims may not report incidents of sexual violence to law enforcement or other designated officials for various reasons , including feelings of guilt , shame , embarrassment , or fear .
college students who are victims of sexual violence may suffer from a variety of physical and mental health conditions , which may also impact their academic performance .
however , as researchers and others have noted , the findings from individual campus climate surveys may not reflect the experiences of students nationwide and the different survey instruments share some of the same methodological limitations , such as a lack of standard definitions and metrics .
to address these objectives , we reviewed survey instruments and methodological documentation for three widely administered and publicly available campus climate surveys to understand the strengths and limitations of using such surveys .
sexual violence , which can include crimes such as rape and other forms of sexual coercion , is widely acknowledged as a problem on college campuses .
in addition , justice and hhs have funded grants for campus sexual violence prevention and response efforts .
