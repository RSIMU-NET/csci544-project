departments of health and human services ( hhs ) , labor , and treasury issued interim final regulations that required coverage for a range of preventive services .
it also examines proposed legislative options and examples of religious exemptions in existing state and federal law .
hhs , labor , and treasury have issued final rules to exempt certain religious employers from complying with the requirement that health plans include contraceptive services .
the resulting rules and related guidance included coverage of contraceptive methods .
specifically , health plans offered by employers and health insurers must cover certain recommended preventive health services without cost sharing ( e.g. , charging a co - payment or deductible ) to patients for such services .
however , the controversy has intensified over the scope of the exemption , which appears to apply to churches , but potentially not other religiously affiliated institutions such as universities , hospitals , and social service providers .
this report will analyze the legal implications for the preventive services requirements and the potential penalties faced by religious organizations that do not comply with the rule .
following enactment of aca , the u.s .
this requirement has generated controversy and debate involving religious groups who oppose contraception based on their religious beliefs .
since the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) in 2010 , religious institutions have raised concerns regarding the applicability of certain statutory provisions that would require the coverage of health services to which religious organizations may object .
the bill states no guideline or regulation issued pursuant to subsection ( a ) ( 4 ) , or any other provision of the patient protection and affordable health care act , or the amendments made by that act ( p.l .
section 2713 of the public health service act ( phsa ) , as added by aca and incorporated under section 715 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ) and section 9815 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the internal revenue code ( irc ) , requires group health plans and health insurance issuers that offer group or individual health insurance coverage to provide coverage for certain preventive health services without imposing any cost sharing requirements .
the proposed legislation would amend section 2713 of the public health service act to exempt individuals and entities from requirements related to contraceptive or sterilization service if those individuals and entities have a religious objection to such services .
a number of religious exemptions have been enacted to legislative mandates , both in the context of state requirements for contraceptive coverage and other unrelated contexts .
the guidelines are supported by the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) .
bills that would exempt individuals and entities with religious objections from the coverage of contraceptive and sterilization services have been introduced in the house and senate .
furthermore , employers who do not cover contraceptives may face potential liability under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 , as some courts have indicated that denying coverage may constitute sex discrimination .
however , such exemptions may be enacted by congress or promulgated by an agency as a matter of public policy .
