improvements to industrial base capability assessments could lead to increased readiness and to reduced costs for unneeded wartime spare parts inventories in this report , we address whether ( 1 ) the army has begun to collect and use current industrial base data and ( 2 ) opportunities exist to improve the reliability of the army's industrial base capability assessments .
to accomplish this review , we interviewed army officials who are responsible for estimating the requirements and developing budgets for war reserve spare parts and for assessing what portion of those requirements private industry is capable of providing .
this report follows up on our may 2001 recommendation that the secretary of the army develop improved estimates of private industry's spare parts production capability for meeting currently projected wartime scenarios .
we also talked with officials from the defense logistics agency about its industrial base assessment program .
we made this recommendation after we found that the army relied on internally generated data rather than on current data from industry to develop its industrial base capability assessments .
the army concurred with our recommendation and cited actions it intends to take .
out - of - date data could result in reduced readiness and inflated or understated war reserve spare parts funding requests within budget submissions to congress .
in order to improve the army's readiness for wartime operations , achieve greater economy in purchasing decisions , and provide congress with accurate budget submissions for war reserve spare parts , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to have the commander of army material command take the following actions to expand or change its current process consistent with the attributes in this report: establish an overarching industrial base capability assessment process that considers the attributes in this report ; develop a method to efficiently collect current industrial base capability data directly from industry itself ; create analytical tools that identify potential production capability problems such as those due to surge in wartime spare parts demand ; and create management strategies for resolving spare parts availability problems , for example , by changing acquisition procedures or by targeting investments in material and technology resources to reduce production lead times .
of this amount , the army has been funded $0.11 billion for fiscal years 2000-2002 and expects to request $0.47 billion in fiscal years 2003-2007 .
dod partially concurred with the overall findings and recommendations .
without a process that provides such analysis , the army cannot identify long lead times and create management strategies to reduce lead times and thus the amount of inventory needed .
the army's approach to industrial base capability assessments lacks key attributes that include the collection of current industry data , the analysis of that data and the creation of management strategies for improving wartime spare parts availability .
such analyses contribute to identifying possible production capability problems and could enhance the army's management decisions .
the resulting total spare parts shortfall was $1.24 billion .
dod's current policy calls for each military service to determine its requirements and acquire sufficient war reserve materiel for the execution of current wartime scenarios and to be able to sustain these operations until being re - supplied .
