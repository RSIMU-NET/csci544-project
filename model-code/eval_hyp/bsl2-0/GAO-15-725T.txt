my statement today will discuss ( 1 ) cybersecurity challenges that federal agencies face in securing their systems and information and ( 2 ) government - wide initiatives , including those led by dhs , aimed at improving agencies' cybersecurity .
such incidents underscore the urgent need for effective implementation of information security controls at federal agencies .
since 1997 , we have designated federal information security as a government - wide high - risk area , and in 2003 expanded this area to include computerized systems supporting the nation's critical infrastructure .
most recently , in the 2015 update to our high - risk list , we further expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information ( pii ) — that is , personal information that is collected , maintained , and shared by both federal and nonfederal entities .
as you know , the federal government faces an array of cyber - based threats to its systems and data , as illustrated by the recently reported data breaches at the office of personnel management ( opm ) , which affected millions of current and former federal employees .
deployment may have been hampered by various implementation and policy challenges .
in preparing this statement , we relied on our previous work in these areas , as well as the preliminary observations from our ongoing review of dhs's einstein initiative .
thank you for inviting me to testify at today's hearing on the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to secure federal information systems .
we discussed these observations with dhs officials .
while these initiatives all have potential benefits , they also have limitations .
in addition to the efforts of individual agencies , dhs and omb have several initiatives under way to enhance cybersecurity across the federal government .
while recent government - wide initiatives hold promise for bolstering the federal cybersecurity posture , it is important to note that no single technology or set of practices is sufficient to protect against all these threats .
while agencies have elements of such a strategy in place , more needs to be done to fully implement it and to address existing weaknesses .
the ncps intrusion detection capability appears to have been implemented at 23 cfo act agencies.capability appears to have limited deployment , at portions of only 5 of these agencies .
the intrusion prevention in conclusion , the danger posed by the wide array of cyber threats facing the nation is heightened by weaknesses in the federal government's approach to protecting its systems and information .
dhs has identified a set of ncps capabilities that are planned to be implemented in fiscal year 2016 , but it does not appear to have developed formalized requirements for capabilities planned through fiscal year 2018 .
the objectives of our review are to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) ncps meets stated objectives , ( 2 ) dhs has designed requirements for future stages of the system , and ( 3 ) federal agencies have adopted the system .
a “defense in depth” strategy is required that includes well - trained personnel , effective and consistently applied processes , and appropriately implemented technologies .
the prior reports cited throughout this statement contain detailed discussions of the scope of the work and the methodology used to carry it out .
