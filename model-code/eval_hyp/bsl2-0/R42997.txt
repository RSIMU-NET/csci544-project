such changes , they add , could improve effectiveness and save money .
they suggest that for such cross - cutting issues , more "unified" budgeting approaches could facilitate the identification of overlaps and gaps among agencies' efforts ; enable more deliberate assignment of roles and responsibilities ; catalyze closer collaboration ; and provide greater transparency to help support congressional oversight .
for congress , constitutionally mandated to control the power of the purse , fundamental issues at stake include both oversight of the effectiveness and efficiency of u.s. government national security activities , and the integrity of the overall federal system of budgeting .
members of the school broadly share the view that some u.s. national security concerns , such as counter - terrorism , or stabilization and reconstruction , are inherently cross - cutting: that is , they require the participation of multiple agencies , and their associated responsibilities could conceivably be divided up any number of ways among various agencies .
in turn , members of the school argue that the current system allows little space for holistic consideration of such cross - cutting national security issues , and they propose an array of budgetary tools designed to promote cross - fertilization .
the primary concern of this unified national security budgeting school , loosely defined , is not to improve u.s. budgeting practices per se , but rather to use budgetary mechanisms to drive changes in the priorities and practice of national security .
of particular interest may be the extent to which , if any , efforts to optimize the overall system , and efforts to optimize its national security "sub - system," constitute competing imperatives .
various proponents have put forward quite different proposed remedies and are — apparently — aiming to solve quite different underlying problems .
this report describes and characterizes the unified national security budgeting school's broadly shared critique of the current system ; describes and analyzes various proposed unified national security budgeting approaches ; and offers a succinct list of considerations for members and staff of congress who may be interested in this issue .
that interest reflects concerns with effectiveness — how well the u.s. government accomplishes the mission — and with efficiency — how well the u.s. government stewards scarce resources — in the national security arena .
the school itself is far from unified — there is no single model for "unified national security budgeting. .
recent years have witnessed a growing interest , in congress , in the executive branch , and in the broader policy community , in re - examining how well the u.s. government conducts the business of national security — from decision - making , to strategy - making , to budgeting , to planning and execution , to accountability and oversight .
within the context of these debates , a number of practitioners and observers have called for the adoption of "unified" — or "consolidated" or "integrated" — approaches to national security budgeting .
the fact that the debate itself is not cohesive has no logical bearing on the value of the various associated proposals , but it suggests a need to define terms , as a starting point .
