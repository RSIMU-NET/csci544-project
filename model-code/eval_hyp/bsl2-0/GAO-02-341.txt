over the last few years , various members of congress and the administration have become increasingly concerned that district judge trial courtrooms may be underutilized and that more courtrooms than needed have been , and continue to be , constructed .
as agreed , our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) examine the judiciary's courtroom sharing policies for senior judges , ( 2 ) obtain information about the extent to which senior judges are currently sharing courtrooms and their experiences with courtroom sharing , and ( 3 ) determine the judiciary's efforts to explore the potential for senior judges to share courtrooms in future courthouse construction projects .
the judiciary continues to believe that it should retain its one - judge , one - courtroom policy for active district judges because of the potential negative effects courtroom sharing may have on effective judicial administration .
however , the judiciary did determine that courtroom sharing may be possible among some senior judges .
to meet our objectives , we examined existing policies on courtroom sharing for all district courts , obtained information about district judges' courtroom sharing experiences at locations where courtroom sharing was occurring , and reviewed courtroom needs assessment studies done by the judiciary for 33 proposed projects in the judiciary's 5-year construction plan to identify where courtroom sharing was planned .
on march 5 , 2002 , we received written comments on a draft of this report from the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aoc ) — the judiciary's administrative arm .
this report responds to your request for information on the judiciary's efforts to have district judges share courtrooms , especially district judges with senior status , also known as senior judges .
given this , you wanted updated information on the status of courtroom sharing in the judiciary by senior district judges .
these comments are discussed later in this letter .
the judiciary's updated long - range plan — five - year courthouse construction plan ( fiscal years 2002-2006 ) — contained 45 proposed new courthouse construction projects .
as with any planning process , the assumptions that have to be made will always involve some uncertainty .
there has been a belief among various stakeholders outside the judiciary , including some subcommittees and members of congress as well as the office of management and budget ( omb ) , that courtroom sharing may be possible and could lead to cost savings .
the judiciary and the general services administration ( gsa ) have embarked on a multibillion - dollar courthouse construction initiative to address the space needs of the federal district courts and related agencies .
the plan identified a total of 45 proposed courthouse construction projects that are expected to cost a total of about $2.6 billion .
for several years , there has been much debate about whether district judges could share courtrooms — operate in a courthouse with fewer courtrooms than judges — to save taxpayer dollars without compromising effective judicial administration .
the judiciary's most recent 5-year construction plan for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 identified new courthouses or annexes that are to be built to accommodate new judgeships created because of increasing caseloads and to replace obsolete courthouses occupied by existing judges .
