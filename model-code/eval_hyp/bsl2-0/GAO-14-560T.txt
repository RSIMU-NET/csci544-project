the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that oversees medicare , has estimated that improper payments in the medicare program were almost $50 billion in fiscal year 2013 , about $5 billion higher than in 2012 .
since its inception , medicare has been administered largely by contractors with federal oversight and these contractors have a responsibility to help ensure medicare program integrity .
cms must oversee their efforts to help ensure proper payments and address the program's many vulnerabilities , which include service - or system - specific weaknesses that can lead to payment errors , including those due to fraud .
it is primarily based on our medicare program integrity products issued and recommendations made from april 2004 through march 2014 , as well as selected updates on cms activities , have identified as important to reducing fraud , waste , and abuse , and ultimately improper payments: and will focus on progress related to three key strategies we strengthening provider enrollment standards and procedures , improving prepayment and postpayment review of claims , and addressing identified vulnerabilities .
in 2013 , medicare financed health care services for approximately 51 million individuals at a cost of about $604 billion , and reported some of the largest estimates of improper payments among federal programs â€” payments that either were made in an incorrect amount or should not have been made at all .
if cms suspects that providers or suppliers are billing fraudulently , it can take action through its contractors , including suspending claims payment , revoking billing privileges , or referring cases to law enforcement for investigation .
my statement today focuses on the progress made and important steps to be taken by cms to reduce fraud in medicare .
as cms continues its implementation of ppaca and small business jobs act provisions , additional evaluation and oversight will help determine whether implementation of these provisions has been effective in reducing improper payments .
fraud may also involve payments made to beneficiaries to obtain their medicare number for fraudulent billing purposes .
although the full extent of the problem is unknown , it is clear that , as one of the largest programs in the federal government , the medicare program is vulnerable to fraud , contributing to its fiscal problems .
we received updated information from cms in april 2014 on its actions related to the laws , regulations , and guidance that we discuss in this statement .
we are investing resources in a body of work that assesses cms's efforts to refine and improve its fraud detection and prevention abilities .
although there have been convictions for multimillion - dollar schemes that defrauded the medicare program , the extent of the problem is unknown .
notably , we are currently assessing the potential use of electronic - card technologies , which can help reduce medicare fraud .
identifying the nature , extent , and underlying causes of improper payments , and developing adequate corrective action processes to address vulnerabilities , are essential prerequisites to reducing them .
there are no reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in the medicare program or for the health care industry as a whole .
