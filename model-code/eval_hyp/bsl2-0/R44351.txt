whether dodd - frank has been effective in lowering structural risks to the u.s. and global financial systems remains a subject of debate .
in addition , some argue that dodd - frank has imposed costs that affect the competitiveness of u.s. financial institutions .
some observers believe that the growth of speculative derivatives trading has increased the risks of market instability and volatility , whereas others argue that such speculation adds liquidity and that more liquid derivatives markets are more efficient and more stable .
over the longer term , total global notional values outstanding for otc derivatives have fallen from $684 trillion as of june 2008 to $553 trillion as of june 30 , 2015 , and to further to $493 trillion as of december 30 , 2015 .
the financial crisis led to intense debate about whether the rapid growth in derivatives markets had contributed to structural instability in the u.s. and global financial systems .
dodd - frank also aimed to ensure that large derivatives bets by financial firms would be collateralized by having those firms post margin , or cash , into accounts to pay for potential losses from derivatives .
such debates led , in 2010 , to the passage of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ; p.l .
111-203 ) , which required that risk exposures of major financial institutions be backed by capital , minimizing the shock to the financial system should such firms fail .
although derivatives trading has its origins in agriculture , today most derivatives are linked to financial variables , such as interest rates , foreign exchange rates , stock prices , and the creditworthiness of bond issuers , as shown in figure 1 .
the market is measured in hundreds of trillions of dollars , and billions of contracts are traded annually .
growth in derivatives markets was explosive between 2000 and the advent of the 2008 financial crisis , with some retrenchment after 2008 .
the reasons for the crisis are still the subject of wide debate , but most observers believe a major factor behind the severe market turmoil was derivatives exposures , which could not be readily quantified and exacerbated panic and uncertainty about the true financial condition of other market participants , contributing to the freezing of credit markets .
of the total , 78% of global swaps consisted of interest - rate swaps as of dec. 30 , 2015 , illustrating the predominance of financial instruments over agricultural ones .
following the 2008 financial crisis , the total notional value of otc derivatives globally fell by about 13% between june 2008 and december 2008 but then crept upward again .
from 2000 until the end of 2008 , the volume of derivatives contracts traded on exchanges , such as futures exchanges , and the notional value of total contracts traded in the over - the - counter ( otc ) market grew by 475% and 522% , respectively .
this report discusses some of these debates as they relate to selected legislative proposals in the 114 th congress affecting the regulation of derivatives .
such speculation adds liquidity to the market â€” speculators assume risks that hedgers wish to avoid .
