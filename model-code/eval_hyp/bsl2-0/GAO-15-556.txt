to address these issues , some federal and state legislators and the president have proposed efforts to expand workplace retirement savings program coverage in recent years .
in addition , other countries face similar concerns and some have developed strategies to increase coverage that may offer lessons for the united states .
this report examines: 1. recent estimates of workplace retirement savings program coverage , including eligibility and participation , and characteristics of workers who lack coverage ; 2. strategies used by states and other countries to expand coverage among private sector workers ; and 3. potential challenges states could face given existing federal law and regulations .
you asked us to review issues related to efforts to expand coverage in workplace retirement savings programs .
in response to the large share of the workforce that continues to lack coverage , there are mounting concerns that millions of workers will not have sufficient savings for retirement , adding to already significant burdens on state and national safety nets .
although a growing number of employers have adopted automatic enrollment , a considerable number of programs still do not offer this feature and prior research shows that the overall coverage rate has not increased substantially .
to develop estimates of retirement savings program coverage , we obtained data from the survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) and output provided by the census bureau , which replicated our analysis using sipp data linked to taxpayer data .
as workers live longer and face potential changes to future social security benefits , participating in a workplace retirement savings program is increasingly important to help ensure their retirement income security .
research has shown that other workers may not participate because of inertia — their employer's program requires workers to make an active decision to participate rather than automatically enrolling workers and allowing them to opt out .
however , as we recently reported , 29 percent of households age 55 and older do not have any retirement savings or a defined benefit pension .
to address the legal uncertainty stemming from erisa preemption of state laws while maintaining the advantages of erisa for both employers and workers , congress should consider providing states limited flexibility to pursue efforts to increase coverage under workplace retirement savings programs .
while some workers may choose not to participate in a workplace retirement savings program , a considerable number may not have the option either because their employer does not offer one or because the worker is not eligible to participate .
these efforts generally strive to overcome obstacles for employers to offer workplace retirement savings programs or for workers to participate .
we also studied efforts to expand coverage in three countries that have voluntary workplace retirement savings programs — canada , new zealand , and the united kingdom .
the president and some members of congress have proposed various efforts over the years to expand workplace retirement savings program coverage among private sector workers .
to identify strategies to expand private - sector workplace retirement savings program coverage and the potential challenges states could face given existing federal law and regulations , we obtained information about recent state efforts and conducted case studies in six states — california , illinois , maryland , massachusetts , washington , and west virginia .
