in fiscal year 2016 , arng disbursed more than $185 million to soldiers for these incentives .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for us to assess policies and procedures for identifying and minimizing improper payments and requests to waive the recoupment of improper payments .
this report ( 1 ) evaluates the extent to which arng has implemented and planned to adjust the internal controls for its selected reserve incentive program to prevent improper payments and ( 2 ) describes which dod organizations have the authority to waive arng soldiers' incentive debt and any steps dod has taken to improve the availability of documentation to adjudicate waiver cases .
while the department of defense ( dod ) initially took actions to recoup some of these payments , subsequent guidance from the office of the secretary of defense in october 2016 and the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 allowed for the waiver or other forgiveness of debt for most of the affected california arng soldiers .
if arng does not proactively identify , analyze , and plan to respond to significant changes that could affect the internal controls to its incentive program , there is an increased risk that additional weaknesses to its internal controls could emerge and result in an increased likelihood of improper payments .
to its credit , arng has taken mitigating actions to prevent improper payments while attempting to address those issues .
california arng officials had identified more than $22 million in improper incentive payments during that time period .
following a 2011 report by the army audit agency detailing weaknesses in internal controls over incentive payments — including fraud — in the california arng , the national guard bureau ( ngb ) conducted a review of all payments to california arng soldiers under its selected reserve incentive program , which provides cash bonuses and other payments , during fiscal years 2004 through 2010 .
these challenges , and the need for mitigating actions , could have been prevented if arng had identified and prepared in advance for challenges potentially resulting from the vendor transition .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
in order to receive these incentives , soldiers must fulfill the obligations specified in their contracts .
arng has also taken steps to address unforeseen technical issues that have affected its incentive program .
in order to recruit and retain personnel to reach this end strength , arng contracts with current and prospective soldiers to provide enlistment , re - enlistment , and other financial incentives for specified terms of service in certain occupational specialties .
arng has made progress in improving its internal controls since widespread improper payments were identified in california in 2008 .
arng is authorized to have an end strength of 343,500 in fiscal year 2018 .
for objective one , we reviewed applicable dod guidance on the use of incentive programs and compared this guidance with our observations of how this guidance was implemented in six selected states .
we compared our observations against federal internal control standards related to risk assessment .
we are making one recommendation to arng: the director of the army national guard should develop and implement a plan to identify , analyze , and address any significant changes that could affect internal controls for its guard incentive management system .
