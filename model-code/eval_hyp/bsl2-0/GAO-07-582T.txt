in justifying much of the $5.8 billion in its supplemental fiscal year 2007 security forces fund request and its fiscal year 2008 security forces fund request , dod has pointed out that without the funds designated for mod and moi logistics and sustainment functions the coalition would have to continue to support the isf .
however , coalition and u.s. support forces are providing extensive combat service support to the isf .
in its most recent report to congress , issued in november 2006 , dod stated that although the iraqi ministry of defense ( mod ) and ministry of interior ( moi ) had about 323,000 trained and equipped forces , the most serious shortcoming for both ministries' capabilities lay in planning and executing their logistics and sustainment requirements .
in february 2006 , the department of defense ( dod ) issued its third report to congress , measuring stability and security in iraq , and stated that with the generation of regular line infantry battalions in the iraqi army largely completed , the focus of the train - and - equip program was shifting toward building combat support and combat service support units .
in its next report to congress , issued in may 2006 , dod stated that more than 65 percent of personnel in the iraqi army's support forces had been trained and equipped and that logistics units were continuing to increase in capability .
however , in august 2006 dod reported that logistics capabilities continued to be an area of significant concern for the iraqi police service , particularly with respect to vehicle maintenance , and that extensive support to iraqi military forces was being provided by multi - national force - iraq .
currently , much of the discussion on the size and shape of u.s. forces in iraq has focused on the relationship between trained and equipped iraqi security forces and u.s. combat brigades .
the components of logistics are sustainment , maintenance , supply , transportation , services , and health support .
in november 2005 , the national security council issued the national strategy for victory in iraq , which states that the coalition will adjust its “posture and approaches as conditions evolve and iraqi capabilities grow,” and that coalition troop levels in iraq will decrease over time as the iraqis take on more responsibilities for themselves .
according to dod , fiscal year 2007 is the “year of leaders and logistics” in iraq .
the national strategy implies a conditions - based linkage between the development of the isf , including its logistical and other support capabilities , and the size and shape of the u.s. presence in iraq .
in response to the growing interest by members of congress , we began a review under the authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations at his own initiative in order to provide information on the status and challenges of developing isf support capabilities .
it is the process of planning , implementing , and controlling the efficient , effective flow and storage of goods , services , and related information from point of origin to point of consumption for the purpose of conforming to operational requirements and the sustainment of the operations to the successful accomplishment of the mission or task .
