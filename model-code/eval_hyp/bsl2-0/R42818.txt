and ( 3 ) does wind power impact electric system reliability ? .
 ( 2 ) does wind power contribute to negative wholesale power price events within competitive electric power markets ? .
specific information for three rto / iso organizations is provided in this report: ( 1 ) midwest independent system operator ( miso ) , ( 2 ) pjm , and ( 3 ) electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) .
additionally , this report addresses three specific questions about the market interaction of wind power and electric power generators: ( 1 ) how might wind power affect wholesale market clearing prices ? .
this report analyzes the impacts of wind generation on competitive power markets , including financial and economic impacts on electric power generators .
this report focuses on data and information available for competitive electricity markets that are managed by a regional transmission operator ( rto ) or independent system operator ( iso ) .
overall , the goal of this report is to provide context for several electricity market concepts that are relevant to understanding the economic effects of wind power generation .
furthermore , these rtos are commonly cited as markets that are being affected by wind power generation .
as a result , there is no discussion of wind power market impacts within cost - of - service , vertically integrated electricity markets that are common in the west and southeast regions of the united states , nor is there any discussion of how wind power is managed by federally owned transmission system operators such as the bonneville power administration .
these three rtos were selected for the analysis in an effort to limit the scope of this report .
under current law , tax credit incentives for new wind power projects are scheduled to end on january 1 , 2013 .
however , other studies have concluded that additional wind power production within rto markets will reduce wholesale prices and ultimately reduce electricity costs to consumers .
the immediate policy issue related to the market and economic effects of wind power is the future of production tax credit ( ptc ) incentives for wind projects .
states essentially create demand for wind power projects by implementing renewable portfolio standard ( rps ) policies that require a certain amount of renewable power to be generated by a certain date .
u.s. wind power growth has resulted in several challenges that are being addressed in various power markets throughout the country .
some of the most common variables include: ( 1 ) economic activity and load demand , ( 2 ) weather , ( 3 ) fuel prices , ( 4 ) transmission congestion , and ( 5 ) zero marginal cost generation .
growth in the u.s. wind power sector has been influenced by complementary policies and incentives at both the state and federal level .
wind electricity generation in the united states has experienced rapid growth over the last two decades .
in 1992 , cumulative installed u.s. wind capacity was approximately 1,500 megawatts ( mw ) .
the federal production tax credit is currently 2.2 cents ( $0.022 ) for each kilowatt - hour of electricity produced from a qualified wind project .
additionally , the financial performance of electricity generators operating in competitive power markets is multi - dimensional and is influenced by a number of variables ( e.g. , natural gas costs , coal costs , electricity demand , and transmission congestion ) .
