at that time , fdic estimated the second resolution would cost the bank insurance fund ( bif ) about $500 million .
the lawsuits asserted , among other things , that federal and state banking regulators acted without regard to due process and illegally and unnecessarily closed a solvent banking organization .
in fdic's view , the settlement is based on the following two principles: ( 1 ) the 1992 resolution of the first city banks would be at no cost to bif , and ( 2 ) fdic would not receive any money in excess of its actual costs incurred in connection with the resolution of the first city banks .
in june 1994 , fdic and first city signed a settlement agreement that provided for payments by fdic exceeding $200 million in cash and assets to be paid out of the receiverships of the first city banks and termination of all related litigation .
in january 1993 , fdic reviewed bids for the 20 failed banks , announced the sale of the banks , and revised its estimated bif cost to zero .
in april 1988 , fdic provided about $970 million of assistance in an attempt to restore first city's financial health .
fdic officials anticipate a decision on the settlement agreement in early 1995 .
any settlement reached between the parties cannot be consummated until it is approved by the bankruptcy court .
this report addresses the following four questions: regarding the first resolution , why did the fdic board of directors decide to resolve first city's financial difficulties in 1988 by providing financial assistance instead of using other available resolution alternatives ? .
in fewer than 5 years , the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) was called upon twice to resolve the financial difficulties of the federally insured banks of the first city bancorporation of texas , inc. ( first city ) .
lawsuits were filed by first city against fdic , occ , and the texas banking commissioner .
at the request of the former committee chairman , we reviewed both resolutions of the first city banks .
as agreed with the committee , we focused our review on first city's largest bank ( located in houston ) and its second largest bank ( located in dallas ) because the financial difficulties of these banks resulted in the failure of first city's 18 other banks .
what , if any , additional cost to bif is expected to result from the second resolution of first city ? .
fdic was appointed receiver of all 20 first city banks .
four years later , in october 1992 , the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) and the texas banking commissioner determined that the two largest first city banks were insolvent and imminently insolvent , respectively .
regarding the second resolution , why did fdic's estimate of bif costs to resolve first city at the time of the 1992 failure differ so much from the estimate when the banks were sold in 1993 ? .
what lessons does the first city experience offer relevant to the assistance , closure , and resolution processes ? .
our objectives , scope , and methodology are further discussed in appendix i .
