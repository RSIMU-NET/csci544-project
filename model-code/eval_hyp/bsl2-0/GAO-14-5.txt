the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 further amended the rla and mandated gao to evaluate nmb's programs and management practices .
we reviewed key nmb documents , including its most recent 5-year strategic plan , its annual performance and accountability report , and congressional budget justification documents , and compared nmb's performance planning and reporting practices with requirements in the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) as updated by the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) and related leading practices identified in our previous work .
specifically , this report examines: 1. the extent to which the national mediation board follows federal strategic planning requirements and leading practices , 2. the extent to which the national mediation board has key management controls in place — for financial management ; information management , security , and privacy ; human capital and workforce development ; and procurement — to fulfill its mission , and 3. how the national mediation board addresses challenges , if any , in its process for overseeing employee representation elections .
in addition , we assessed nmb's plans , policies , and practices in financial management ; information management , security , and privacy ; human capital ; and procurement using gao's standards for internal control in the federal government , the federal information security management act of 2002 , privacy act of 1974 , e - government act of 2002 , guidelines developed by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the national institute of standards and technology , and criteria developed by gao in prior work .
we identified key practices from these criteria and assessed whether nmb is following these practices ( nmb is taking appropriate actions and has a formal plan , policy , or other document ) , partially following ( nmb is taking some actions but does not have a formal plan or policy and / or some additional steps are needed to consider this practice implemented ) , or minimally following ( nmb is taking little or no action to address this practice ) .
to address these objectives , we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed nmb officials , current board members , and all board members who served from 2000 through 2012 .
recognizing the significant consequences of work stoppages as a result of disputes between labor and management , in 1926 , congress enacted the railway labor act ( rla ) to provide a framework for ensuring harmonious labor relations in the railroad industry .
we also interviewed key stakeholders , including representatives from rail and air labor and management groups .
a 1934 amendment to the rla created the national mediation board ( nmb ) , an independent federal agency that provides mediation and other services to help resolve labor disputes over issues such as working conditions and rates of pay .
we also reviewed nmb's financial statement audits for fiscal years 2004 through 2012 and the most recent cycle of internal control reviews of program and management areas , and interviewed nmb's independent auditors about identified internal control weaknesses .
in addition , nmb is responsible for resolving disputes over union representation and the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements .
