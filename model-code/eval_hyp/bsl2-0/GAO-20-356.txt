this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which the program is meeting cost goals and ( 2 ) performance and schedule challenges that the program has experienced in developmental testing and plans for addressing them .
to evaluate the extent to which the program is meeting cost goals , we identified and assessed changes in the program's development , production , and operation and support cost estimates by comparing the program's april 2014 approved program baseline estimates with estimates developed in april 2019 that supported the program's production decision .
the navy's acquisition strategy is to integrate mature technologies and an executive interior into an existing in - production commercial helicopter while minimizing modifications to avoid the technical challenges and cost overruns that led to the termination of its predecessor program in 2009 .
however , program officials told us that the program can cover any additional costs with existing funding .
delivery of production vh - 92a helicopters is scheduled to begin in april 2021 with final delivery in january 2023 .
the national defense authorization act of 2014 includes a provision for gao to report annually on the acquisition of the vh - 92a presidential helicopter until the navy awards a contract for full - rate production .
we have previously issued five reports in response to this provision .
navy officials indicated that the transition process will be gradual , and that the existing fleet is sufficiently funded until hmx - 1 completes the transition .
further , navy officials stated that should ioc be delayed , the navy will continue to use its existing fleet of presidential helicopters as the vh - 92a transitions into the hmx - 1 fleet .
in turn , the program may need to keep certain staff in place longer than originally planned , potentially increasing program costs .
these data were contained in defense acquisition executive summary reports , selected acquisition reports , and briefings provided by the program office and sikorsky aircraft corporation , a lockheed martin company ( the prime contractor for the program ) .
the vh - 92a program is expected to provide new helicopters that ensure the safe , reliable , and timely transportation of the president and other parties as directed by the white house military office .
the navy's vh - 92aÂ® program is to replace the aging presidential helicopter fleet , which has been in service for several decades .
the navy plans to acquire a fleet of 23 vh - 92a helicopters to replace the marine corps' existing fleet of vh - 3d and vh - 60n helicopters .
we also examined and analyzed key acquisition documents , including contractor monthly status reports and defense contract management agency reports .
we interviewed officials from the office of cost assessment and program evaluation ( cape ) , the navy's presidential helicopter program office to discuss the methodology used to develop the independent cost estimate , and component cost position , respectively .
we also compared cape's independent cost estimate to the navy's component cost estimate to identify differences in the estimates .
to assess the challenges gao previously identified and those recently experienced in developmental testing and steps taken to address those challenges , we examined may 2019 operational assessment reports on the vh - 92a program prepared by the navy's commander , operational test and evaluation force and the director , operational testing and evaluation ; and contractor and defense contract management agency status reports .
