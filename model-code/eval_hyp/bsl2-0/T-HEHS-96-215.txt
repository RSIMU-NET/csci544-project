as a result , stakeholders are interested in programs that protect consumers from cost reduction strategies that might adversely affect their health care .
this statement relies on two of our recent reports , titled medicare: federal efforts to enhance patient quality of care ( gao / hehs - 96-20 , apr .
10 , 1996 ) , health care reform: “report cards” are useful but significant issues need to be addressed ( gao / hehs - 94-219 , sept. 29 , 1994 ) , and other past reports on related issues .
but stakeholders — hcfa , private - sector purchasers , and others , such as individual consumers — are concerned that the cost control strategies hmos use could lead to diminished quality of care .
today , i will discuss the following four areas related to quality assessment: quality assessment methods used by large corporate purchasers of health quality assessment methods used by hcfa in administering the medicare quality assessment methods hcfa plans for the future , and what both corporate purchasers and hcfa are doing to share the information about quality with employees and medicare beneficiaries .
like large private - sector purchasers of health care , hcfa , which administers medicare , finds the potential for cost savings associated with managed care attractive .
the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) now estimates that 4.3 million medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) , and enrollment is growing at a rate of about 100,000 new members per month .
although these are reasonable approaches to assessing quality , we have reported that hcfa has failed to aggressively enforce legal and regulatory requirements for its risk contract hmos .
hcfa is now enhancing its quality assessment methods by strengthening its collaboration with the private sector to jointly develop better performance indicators for the health care needs of older americans .
second , through its medicare peer review organization ( pro ) program , hcfa collects and evaluates performance indicators for certain procedures or diseases to assess hmo performance .
 ( a list of related gao products appears at the end of this testimony. ) .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss ways to ensure that quality of care is furnished to medicare beneficiaries joining these hmos .
furthermore , hcfa is placing more emphasis on improving the care all hmos provide , regardless of their prior performance , rather than focusing only on the few providing substandard care .
approximately 54 percent continually monitor certain performance indicators such as immunization rates , mortality from certain procedures , and patient satisfaction .
like corporate purchasers , hcfa is now using similar methods to ensure quality within risk contract hmos .
although hcfa does plan to distribute information to medicare beneficiaries about plan performance , the timetable for doing so is uncertain .
first , as part of its hmo qualification program , hcfa performs initial and subsequent reviews similar to accreditation .
although these strategies are the best available to date , possible data and other limitations make them less than perfect , according to recent research .
in addition , hcfa is developing a survey tool to measure beneficiaries' satisfaction with hmo performance .
