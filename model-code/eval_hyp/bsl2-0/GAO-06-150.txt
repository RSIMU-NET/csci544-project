specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) dhs's actions to develop an overall strategy for protecting the chemical industry ; ( 2 ) dhs's efforts to identify high - risk chemical facilities , assess their vulnerabilities , ensure that facilities are addressing security , and coordinate with epa in these efforts ; ( 3 ) chemical industry security initiatives and challenges ; and ( 4 ) dhs's existing authorities and whether additional legislative authority is needed to ensure that chemical facilities take action to address vulnerabilities .
public debate has centered on whether the federal government should impose security requirements on chemical facilities or continue to work with the chemical industry to voluntarily address security concerns .
the federal government's role in protecting chemical facilities from terrorist attacks has been much debated since september 11 , 2001 .
under an interim national plan released in february 2005 , dhs is to identify and prioritize critical chemical facilities , evaluate the chemical sector's vulnerabilities and risks , develop and implement protective programs for high - priority chemical facilities , identify regulatory options for protective measures , and maintain a relationship with all stakeholders .
in addition , consistent with the homeland security act , a december 2003 presidential directive instructed dhs to produce a comprehensive integrated plan outlining national goals , objectives , milestones , and key initiatives for protecting critical infrastructure and key resources .
the homeland security act of 2002 established the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and set forth its mission to , among other things , prevent terrorist attacks in the united states and reduce the vulnerability of the nation to terrorism .
legislative proposals that would grant dhs or epa , or one of these agencies in consultation with the other , the authority to require chemical facilities to take security steps were introduced in every congress from 2001 to 2005 .
the president's february 2003 national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets sets forth the federal government's roles , objectives , and responsibilities in protecting the nation's critical infrastructure , including the chemical industry .
in this context , you asked us to examine federal and industry efforts to address security concerns at chemical facilities .
the directive also names dhs as the lead agency for the chemical sector , a change from earlier national strategies that named epa as the lead .
in this regard , in 2003 , the department of justice ( justice ) reported that industrial chemical plants remain viable targets and warned that al qaeda operatives may attempt to launch conventional attacks against u.s. chemical facilities to cause contamination , disruption , and terror .
in conducting our work , we interviewed officials from dhs's information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate ( iaip ) , and epa's office of emergency management .
we also reviewed pertinent federal legislation ; epa data ; and dhs documents , including the interim national infrastructure protection plan , an early draft of the chemical sector - specific plan ; and other available reports .
since the events of september 11 , 2001 , government and other experts have recognized the potential threat that chemical facilities pose because many house toxic chemicals that could become airborne and drift to surrounding areas or be used to create a weapon capable of causing harm .
