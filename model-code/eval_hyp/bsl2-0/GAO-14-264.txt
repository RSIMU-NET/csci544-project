while many plans have weathered these challenges , they have raised questions about the ability of some db plans to provide adequate benefits to current workers and retirees in the future .
for some public plans , these challenges have been compounded by some plan sponsors not making recommended plan contributions or granting benefit for increases during more favorable economic environments in the past.private plans , these challenges have occurred in the context of a long decline in the portion of private sector workers covered by such plans .
however , db plans have faced a number of challenges , including the lingering effects from the 2008 stock market downturn ; the implications of lower interest rates for the cost of financing retirement benefits ; increased longevity of plan participants ; and the possibility of a need for higher contributions to these plans .
as of 2011 , state and local government sector db plans covered over 28 million participants , many of whom were not eligible for social security , and private sector db plans covered more than 40 million americans .
at the same time , experts sharply disagree on which approach should be taken to calculate these plans' estimated obligations for benefits promised to workers and retirees , referred to in this report as liabilities regardless of the purpose of the measurement ( e.g. , funding , financial reporting , or employee retirement income security act ( erisa ) reporting ) .
traditional defined benefit ( db ) plans remain an essential source of retirement income , with tens of millions of americans relying on them for retirement security .
more specifically , a major source of disagreement relates to how projected future benefit payments should be discounted — or valued — in today's dollars .
discounting is based on the concept that $1 payable in the future ( e.g. , in 1 year ) is worth less than $1 payable today because the dollar payable today can be invested and grow with interest over that year .
the discounting approach used can have a significant effect on the calculated pension obligations .
as requested , gao examined the differences of opinion concerning discount rates for pension plan valuations and funding .
these differences in approach to the valuations of a plan's liabilities can lead stakeholders and sponsors to draw very different conclusions about an individual plan's financial health , the value of the plan's promised benefits , the contributions required to fund those benefits , the appropriate investment strategy , and perceptions about the health of the defined benefit “system” as a whole .
for example , for a typical pension plan , the liability calculated using a 4 percent discount rate ( a rate close to what would be produced in recent years under certain bond - based approaches , with little or no averaging or “smoothing” ) could be more than 80 percent higher than the liability calculated using an 8 percent discount rate ( a rate commonly used under the assumed - return approach in recent years ) .
in many instances , a bond - based approach produces a lower discount rate , and therefore higher estimates of pension liabilities , than the assumed - return approach , particularly given recent bond market conditions and current u.s. practice in setting assumed - return discount rates .
