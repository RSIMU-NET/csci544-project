official u.s. government concerns about this trend were apparent prior to the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which amplified public criticism within the united states of alleged saudi involvement in terrorism or of saudi laxity in acting against terrorist groups .
the bush administration's statements on saudi arabia's counterterrorism policies have praised new saudi efforts to combat terrorist financing , while generally confirming accounts that suggest that the activities of some saudi entities and individuals have contributed to the spread of terrorism and extremism over time .
this report: reviews allegations of involvement by saudis in terrorist financing together with saudi rebuttals ; discusses the question of saudi support for palestinian organizations and religious charities and schools ( madrasas ) abroad ; analyzes recent steps taken by saudi arabia to counter terrorist financing ( many in conjunction with the united states ) ; and suggests some implications of recent saudi actions for u.s. counterterrorism policy .
similar public and private saudi efforts have financed religious education and proselytization programs in dozens of muslim - majority and muslim - minority countries .
various critics have accused the saudi government of directly supporting terrorism and of creating a permissive environment that has allowed funding to flow to terrorists and extremists .
in 2007 , the u.s. department of state reported that , "saudi donors and unregulated charities have been a major source of financing to extremist and terrorist groups over the past 25 years. .
in places such as afghanistan , pakistan , the philippines , chechnya , bosnia , indonesia , nigeria , kashmir , kosovo , and the west bank and gaza , some of these activities appear to have provided financial or material support to individuals or groups actively involved in terrorism , armed violence , or the propagation of divisive religious ideologies .
the final report released by the bipartisan national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( the 9 / 11 commission ) indicates that the commission "found no evidence that the saudi government as an institution or senior saudi officials individually funded [al qaeda]. .
this has included the provision of assistance to individuals and groups engaged in or victimized by various nationalist and religious conflicts .
the report also states , however , that saudi arabia "was a place where al qaeda raised money directly from individuals and through charities" and indicates that "charities with significant saudi government sponsorship" may have diverted funding to al qaeda .
in april 2008 , undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence stuart levey told the senate finance committee that the saudi government is "serious about fighting al qaeda in the kingdom , and they do," and argued that saudi officials' "seriousness of purpose with respect to the money going out of the kingdom is not as high. .
he added , "saudi arabia today remains the location from which more money is going to... sunni terror groups and the taliban than from any other place in the world. .
since the 1970s , private saudi citizens , saudi government ministries , saudi government charitable committees , and international islamic charity organizations based in saudi arabia have provided financial and relief assistance to muslims around the world .
