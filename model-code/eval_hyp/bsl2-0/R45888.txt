the extent of these barriers , and how construction of these barriers will be funded has become a central part of the interactions between congress and the trump administration on border security and funding legislation for the broader federal government .
this report briefly contextualizes the history of u.s. enforcement of the u.s. - mexico border , before turning to funding for border barriers within the contemporary period , accounting for changing appropriations structures .
this is in part due to the evolving structure of the appropriations for agencies charged with protecting the borderâaccount structures have shifted , initiatives have come and gone , and appropriations prior to fy2017 typically did not specify a precise level of funding for barriers as opposed to other technologies that secure the border .
the trump administration's continued advocacy for funding for a "border wall system" has led to a congressional interest in the historical context for border barrier funding .
congress and the donald j. trump administration are debating enhancing and expanding barriers on the southwest border .
the debate has revealed the lack of an authoritative compilation of data on the details of federal investment in border barriers .
during the 109 th and the first session of the 110 th congresses ( 2005-2007 ) , comprehensive immigration reform legislation and narrower border security measures were debated .
one result was that congress explicitly authorized and funded new construction of border barriers , significantly increasing their presence .
on january 25 , 2017 , the trump administration issued executive order 13767 , "border security and immigration enforcement improvements. .
section 2 ( a ) of the eo indicates that it is the policy of the executive branch to "secure the southern border of the united states through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border , monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration , drug and human trafficking , and acts of terrorism. .
the eo goes on to define "wall" as "a contiguous , physical wall or other similarly secure , contiguous , and impassable physical barrier. .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) customs and border protection ( cbp ) is primarily responsible for border security , including the construction and maintenance of tactical infrastructure , but also the installation and monitoring of surveillance technology , and the deployment of border patrol agents to impede unlawful entries of people and contraband into the united states ( e.g. , unauthorized migrants , terrorists , firearms , and narcotics ) .
the united states' southern border with mexico runs for nearly 2,000 miles over diverse terrain , through varied population densities , and across discontinuous sections of public , private , and tribal land ownership .
cbp has not announced the completion of any additional miles of primary fencing since 2015 , but sections of legacy fencing and breached areas have been replaced or repaired and other improvements have been made .
as noted in " border barrier funding outside the appropriations process ," $124 million of that funding is being used for construction , while $477 million is for real estate planning and acquisition , increased project costs , and construction management costs .
