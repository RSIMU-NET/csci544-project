aca - related provisions have been included in enacted appropriations acts each year since the aca became law .
in addition to their attempts to repeal or amend the aca through authorizing legislation , lawmakers have used the annual appropriations process in an effort to eliminate funding for the aca's implementation and address other concerns they have with the law .
over the past six years , the republican - led house has passed numerous aca - related bills , including legislation that would repeal the entire law .
there has been less debate in the senate , which remained under democratic control through 2014 .
repealing core provisions of the aca and replacing them with new law is a legislative priority for the republican - controlled 115 th congress .
however , a few bills to amend specific elements of the aca that attracted sufficiently broad and bipartisan support were approved by both the house and the senate and signed into law .
in october 2013 , disagreement between the house and senate over the inclusion of aca language in a temporary spending bill for the new fiscal year ( i.e. , fy2014 ) resulted in a partial shutdown of government operations that lasted 16 days .
since the aca's enactment , lawmakers opposed to specific provisions in the aca or the entire law have repeatedly debated its implementation and considered bills to repeal , defund , delay , or otherwise amend the law .
most of this legislative activity has taken place in the house , which reverted to republican control in 2011 .
congress is deeply divided over implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ) , which president obama signed into law in march 2010 .
most of the aca legislation passed by the house during that period was not taken up by the senate .
this report summarizes the aca - related language added to annual appropriations legislation by congressional appropriators since the aca was signed into law .
this report is updated as necessary to reflect key developments in the annual appropriations process .
a companion report , crs report r43289 , legislative actions in the 112th , 113th , and 114th congresses to repeal , defund , or delay the affordable care act , summarizes the authorizing legislation to amend the aca that was enacted during the last three congresses .
while a detailed examination of the aca itself is beyond the scope of this report , a brief overview of the aca's core provisions and its impact on federal spending is provided as context for the material in the table .
it also reviews all the aca legislation taken up and passed by the house during that period .
it includes spending on entitlement programs such as medicare and social security .
the information is presented in table 1 .
federal spending on aca implementation can be grouped into three categories: ( 1 ) mandatory spending on expanding insurance coverage , ( 2 ) mandatory spending on other programs , and ( 3 ) Â discretionary spending .
authorizing laws may provide permanent or temporary appropriations or other forms of budget authority for such spending .
unlike limitations , legislative provisions have the effect of making new law or changing existing law .
