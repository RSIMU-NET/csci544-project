for this review , we assessed ( 1 ) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and the potential effects of any certification delays on nasa's access to the iss ; ( 2 ) the major programmatic and safety risks facing the program and the contractors ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the program has visibility into the contractors' efforts .
2578 includes a provision for us to review the acquisition progress of nasa's human exploration programs , including the commercial crew program .
in the most recent phase of the commercial crew program , nasa awarded firm - fixed - price contracts in 2014 to boeing and space exploration technologies corporation ( spacex ) , valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion , respectively , for the development of crew transportation systems that meet nasa requirements and initial missions to the iss .
we also reviewed information from nasa's budget , its contract with the russian federal space agency , and the iss program to determine how nasa plans to mitigate the effects of any certification delays on its access to the iss .
the house committee on appropriations report accompanying h.r .
according to the contracts , the companies are supposed to provide nasa all the evidence it needs to certify that their systems meet its performance and safety requirements by 2017 .
the contractors have access to nasa's expertise and resources throughout the development process , but nasa engineers are not making design decisions and nasa personnel will be less involved in processing , testing , launching , and operating the crew transportation system .
since then , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has relied on purchasing seats from russia on its soyuz spacecraft to maintain a u.s. presence on the station .
each contractor designs , develops , builds , owns , and operates its spaceflight system and infrastructure .
nasa's goal is to have one or more contractors that can provide crew transportation services to the iss , which is planned to be operational until at least 2024 .
nasa's commercial crew program is intended to end this dependency by facilitating the commercial development of a crew transportation system that can provide safe , reliable , and cost - effective transportation to and from the iss no later than 2017 .
these types of agreements are generally not subject to the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) and allow the government and its contractors greater flexibility in many areas .
to assess the contractors' progress toward certification , we reviewed program and contract documents , including quarterly progress updates and monthly schedule summaries , as well as interviewed program and contractor officials .
nasa's acquisition strategy on the commercial crew program is similar to the one it used successfully on the commercial cargo program , but different than every other spacecraft it has built for humans , from mercury to gemini and apollo to the space shuttle .
following the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 , the united states was left with no domestic ability to provide crew access to the international space station ( iss ) .
we also interviewed program and contractor officials to identify steps being taken to mitigate risks .
