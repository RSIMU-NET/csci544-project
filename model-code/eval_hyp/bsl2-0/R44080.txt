while broadband deployment has been rapid and robust overall , there are parts of the nation where broadband is less deployed ( primarily rural areas ) and there remain regions and communities that are dissatisfied with the level of broadband service currently offered by private sector providers .
with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) moving to define the minimum speed of broadband at 25 mbps , more communities may perceive a lack of adequate broadband service , especially those communities in rural areas .
as a solution , some communities have turned to public entities as possible broadband providers .
public entities that provide broadband service can be local governments or public utilities , for example , and may construct and manage broadband networks either solely or in partnership with private companies .
these communities anticipate that public entities may be able to provide municipal broadband at superior levels of speed , performance , and affordability than what is currently offered by private providers .
these communities point to problems ranging from low download and upload speeds , obsolete technology , poor reliability , high prices , and / or a lack of choice in providers .
these providers include telephone companies , cable companies , wireless providers , and other entities that provide commercial telecommunications services to residential , business , and institutional customers .
many of the cooperatives providing broadband service have received or are eligible for federal loan and grant support from the rural utilities service ( rus ) of the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .
there are a number of municipal broadband models that have been implemented across the nation .
broadband — also referred to as high - speed internet service — has been deployed in the united states since the late 1990s , primarily by private sector providers .
another way congress could support municipal broadband is through funding broadband infrastructure , although funding initiatives are often balanced against fiscal considerations and against concerns over whether federally funded networks unfairly compete against private sector broadband deployment .
the largest numbers of deployments are in washington ( 13 ) , kentucky ( 11 ) , minnesota ( 10 ) , tennessee ( 8 ) , iowa ( 8 ) , illinois ( 7 ) , and florida ( 7 ) .
these cooperatives , in rural areas , have begun in some instances to provide broadband service .
these include loans and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment ; universal service reform ; tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment ; regulatory and deregulatory measures ; and spectrum policy to spur roll - out of wireless broadband services .
the fcc , an independent federal agency charged with regulating interstate and international communications , has taken an active role in promoting the deployment of broadband services and broadband infrastructure .
congress can also have an impact through the appropriations process .
municipal broadband models can include public ownership , public - private partnership , and a cooperative model .
municipal broadband ( also sometimes referred to as "community broadband" ) is a somewhat amorphous term that can signify many different ways that a local government might participate — either directly or indirectly — in the provision of broadband service to the local community .
