specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the status of the scheduling project , ( 2 ) determine the effectiveness of va's management and oversight of the project , and ( 3 ) assess the impact of the project on the department's overall implementation of its health information system modernization initiative — healthevet .
the veterans health administration ( vha ) — a component of va — manages one of the largest health care systems in the united states , providing health care to more than 5 million patients in more than 1,500 facilities .
to carry out its daily operations in providing health care to patients , vha relies on the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) , an information system comprised of multiple applications that include health provider applications ; management and financial applications ; registration , enrollment , and eligibility applications ; health data applications ; and information and education applications .
to determine the effectiveness of va's management and oversight of the project , we compared va's plans and activities in key areas of management controls to best practices , as well as the department's own policies and guidance .
in 2000 , vha began an initiative to modernize the system — the scheduling replacement project — with the goal of creating an outpatient scheduling application that would improve veterans' access to health care .
however , this system is over 25 years old , is inefficient in coordinating care between different sites , and has contributed to increasing wait times for appointments as the number of va patients has grown in recent years .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) is responsible for providing a variety of services to veterans , including medical care , disability compensation , and vocational rehabilitation .
the scheduling replacement project was to result in the first system to be deployed as part of a larger , departmentwide initiative to modernize the department's health information system , known as healthevet .
to assess the impact of the scheduling project on va's overall implementation of its health information system modernization initiative , we reviewed documentation such as briefings from healthevet planning meetings and interviewed officials about the status of the healthevet initiative .
at your request , we conducted a review of va's efforts toward replacing its scheduling system .
as part of vista , vha operates an electronic outpatient scheduling system that automates all aspects of the outpatient appointment process , including the scheduling of patients and the generation of managerial reports .
however , after 9 years of attempting to produce a new outpatient scheduling system , va terminated a key contract supporting the scheduling replacement project in february 2009 and ended the project in september 2009 .
specifically , to determine the status of the project , we reviewed the project management plan and project status reports .
to accomplish our objectives , we reviewed relevant project documentation and interviewed appropriate va and contractor officials .
ensure that the policies and procedures va is establishing to provide meaningful program oversight are effectively executed and that they include ( 1 ) robust collection methods for information on project costs , benefits , schedule , risk assessments , performance metrics , and system functionality to support executive decision making ; ( 2 ) the establishment of reporting mechanisms to provide this information in a timely manner to department it oversight control boards ; and ( 3 ) defined criteria and documented policies on actions the department will take when development deficiencies for a project are identified .
