in 1996 , about 5.9 million taxpayers were assessed almost $1.1 billion in estimated tax ( es ) penalties .
this report , which we prepared under our basic legislative responsibilities , identifies ( 1 ) internal revenue code and irs administrative requirements that cause some of the complexity associated with es penalty calculations and ( 2 ) the likely effects of corresponding changes to the requirements that would make it easier for taxpayers to calculate their es penalties .
the internal revenue service's ( irs ) taxpayer advocate's annual report to congress in 1996 described the es penalty rules as extraordinarily complex , and it characterized the form 2210 used for calculating es penalties as one of the most difficult forms taxpayers have to complete .
nonwage income generally includes income from pensions , interest , self - employment , capital gains , dividends , and partnerships .
for more than 50 years , irs has collected estimated taxes on income not subject to withholding , which is known as nonwage income .
to further simplify the es penalty process for taxpayers , we recommend that congress amend section 6621 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( b ) of the internal revenue code to include the periods june 15 through june 30 , september 15 through september 30 , and january 1 through january 15 .
administrative changes and legislative action would be needed to reduce the number of calculations required on the form 2210 and make it easier for taxpayers to complete .
nonwage income has represented a growing proportion of total u.s. income in recent years , increasing from 16.7 percent to 23.3 percent between 1970 and 1994 .
irs updates the form 2210 annually to account for changes in the federal short - term interest rate .
although the changes would require taxpayers and tax preparers to adjust to using a new form , we believe the recurring advantages of the change would outweigh that one - time adjustment .
in 1994 , these six categories accounted for 91 percent of all nonwage income .
for tax years beginning on january 1 , es payments are due on april 15 , june 15 , september 15 , and january 15 of the following year .
at the beginning of the tax year , taxpayers are to estimate their annual income , determine their potential tax liability , and compute their es payments .
 ( see app .
the percentage of tax returns reporting only nonwage income has likewise increased from 10 percent to 14 percent over the same period .
in 1994 , about 4 million taxpayers self - assessed their es penalties .
these changes would have either little or no effect on es penalty amounts .
the interest rate used to compute the penalty is based on the federal short - term interest rate , which is subject to change the first day of each quarter , that is , january 1 , april 1 , july 1 , and october 1 .
taxpayers using the form to self - assess their es penalties can use either the short or regular method to calculate their es penalty amounts .
to help ensure compliance with the internal revenue code and irs administrative requirements , the form 2210 requires taxpayers to perform numerous calculations to track individual underpayment amounts and to determine precise es penalty amounts .
