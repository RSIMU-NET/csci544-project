since my last testimony before this committee , the united states has continued to develop and implement its strategy for targeting organized piracy , or stop , which outlines priority ip enforcement efforts of six agencies .
to understand more fully how this strategy might contribute to better protection of ip , i will address three topics: ( 1 ) the range and effectiveness of multi - agency efforts on ip protection that preceded stop ; ( 2 ) initial observations on the organization and efforts of stop ; and ( 3 ) initial observations on the efforts of u.s. agencies to prevent counterfeit and pirated goods from entering the united states , which relate to one of stop's goals .
as you stated in this subcommittee's june 2005 hearing on ip protection , the production and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods create health and safety hazards for consumers , damage companies that are victims of this theft , and pose a threat to the u.s. economy .
such goods are widely distributed in global markets , including here in the united states .
however , because protection of intellectual property in many parts of the world is inadequate , u.s. goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy .
the united states dominates the creation and export of intellectual property — creations of the mind — and provides broad protection for intellectual property through means such as copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
these include ( 1 ) a study that we have initiated for this committee focusing on ip enforcement at the u.s. border , ( 2 ) a study for the house government reform committee on interagency efforts to protect ip rights , and ( 3 ) additional work on a customs and border protection ( cbp ) program called the “in - bond system” that allows goods to enter u.s. commerce at a port other than the port of arrival .
to address these issues , we have drawn on a number of completed and ongoing gao studies , including a report on this subject that we published in 2004 and updated in testimony before this committee last year .
in addition , we are presenting some initial and preliminary observations based on three ongoing reviews related to ip protection .
thank you for the opportunity to appear again before the subcommittee to discuss our work on u.s. efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property ( ip ) rights .
we appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the record that this committee has established on ip protection .
however , u.s. law enforcement coordination efforts through niplecc have had difficulties .
stop is the most recent of several interagency ip coordination mechanisms that address ip policy initiatives , training and technical assistance , and law enforcement .
we obtained technical comments on this testimony from cbp and immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) officials and incorporated their changes where appropriate .
some of these have been effective , particularly the special 301 process that identifies inadequate ip protection in other countries and the intellectual property rights ( ipr ) training coordination group .
in conducting the gao studies , we have performed work at multiple u.s. agency headquarters in washington , at u.s. ports of entry , and in other nations .
