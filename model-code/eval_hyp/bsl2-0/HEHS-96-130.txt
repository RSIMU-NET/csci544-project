the congressional budget office estimates that for fiscal year 1996 , the federal government will contract about $42 billion in construction projects throughout the nation .
given the magnitude of these expenditures , inaccurate wage determinations could lead either to excessive government construction costs or to large numbers of workers receiving wages and fringe benefits that are lower than required by the law .
in recent years , the act has drawn controversy , with critics charging that it artificially inflates federal construction costs .
because of your concern about whether labor's procedures under the davis - bacon act allow the use of data that could result in inaccurate wage determinations throughout the nation , you asked us to identify the steps used by labor to collect data and determine and report the prevailing wages to be paid on federally funded construction projects , determine whether specific weaknesses exist in the wage determination process that could have resulted in the use of inaccurate or fraudulent data , and assess the extent to which labor is addressing any identified process weaknesses .
in early 1995 , allegations of the use of inaccurate and fraudulent wage data to determine the prevailing wages paid on federally funded construction projects in one geographic area precipitated a criminal investigation by the department of justice that is still ongoing .
on the basis of its own review , labor concluded that data weaknesses warranted a redetermination of the area's prevailing wage rates , which it issued in april 1996 .
to respond to your request , we collected information from labor's wage and hour division ( whd ) ; interviewed labor officials and staff in washington , d.c. , atlanta , and philadelphia ; surveyed staff in labor's six regions ; and obtained the views of representatives of individual employers , construction unions , and industry associations .
we focused on the policies and procedures that labor had in place to prevent the use of inaccurate or fraudulent wage data .
the davis - bacon act requires employers on federal construction projects to pay workers wages at or above the level determined by the department of labor to be prevailing in a geographic area .
we did not verify the accuracy of the wage determination data labor used or explore the adequacy of labor's survey response rates or its calculation of prevailing wages .
we conducted our review from october 1995 to april 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
appendix i provides more information on our study objectives , scope , and methodology .
labor also needs to revisit its procedures to appeal wage determinations to improve their accessibility .
although labor has indicated that it is unable to do more intensive verification because of limited staff resources , labor does not appear to have explored proposals to target its scarce resources more effectively toward verification efforts .
these reform bills include provisions that would ( l ) increase the $2,000 threshold for construction projects covered by labor's wage surveys and ( 2 ) expand labor's enforcement authority .
technological improvements have also improved labor's ability to administer the davis - bacon wage determination process .
in addition , if it discovers that such alternatives are not feasible for all localities , labor plans to take other action to improve its existing survey process .
