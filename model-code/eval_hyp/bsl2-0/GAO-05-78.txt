the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the federal agency responsible for managing medicare and medicaid , contracts with survey agencies in every state to oversee the quality of nursing home care .
despite federal and state oversight , over half of the decedents in our sample had received unacceptable care that sometimes endangered their health and safety .
our subsequent reports on nursing home quality continued to demonstrate that ( 1 ) an unacceptably large proportion of nursing homes — one - fifth as of early 2002 — harmed residents and ( 2 ) states' periodic inspections of nursing homes failed to identify all serious deficiencies , such as preventable weight loss and pressure sores .
we found oversight weaknesses that were systemic and not limited to california .
under this law , deaths associated with suspected resident neglect , including poor quality care , are referred to the state survey agency and to law enforcement entities .
we also found that state surveyors sometimes classified deficiencies at homes where residents had died as less serious than warranted .
in 1998 , we reviewed allegations that thousands of california nursing home residents died because of poor care .
combined medicare and medicaid payments to nursing homes for care provided to vulnerable elderly and disabled beneficiaries totaled about $64 billion in 2002 , with total federal payments of approximately $45.5 billion .
the series spotlighted an arkansas law requiring investigations by county officials , such as coroners , of all nursing home deaths .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the results of arkansas coroner investigations of nursing home resident deaths , ( 2 ) the experience of the arkansas state survey agency in investigating suspected cases of resident neglect referred by county coroners , and ( 3 ) whether systemic weaknesses in state and federal nursing home oversight identified in our prior reports were evident in the survey agency's investigations of coroner referrals .
you asked us to consider arkansas's experience with required coroner investigations to assess the effectiveness of nursing home oversight by the arkansas state survey agency and by cms .
our preliminary work on this report found that the 1999 arkansas law was the only such law nationwide .
these reviews replaced state self - reporting of their compliance with federal requirements .
an october 2002 series in the st. louis post dispatch concluded that avoidable deaths of vulnerable nursing home residents was a widespread but rarely investigated problem .
examples of reports that track state activities include pending nursing home terminations ( weekly ) ; data entry timeliness ( quarterly ) ; tallies of state surveys that find homes deficiency - free ( semiannually ) ; and analyses , by state , of the most frequently cited deficiencies ( annually ) .
mfcus are charged with investigating and prosecuting medicaid provider fraud and incidents of patient abuse and neglect .
state performance reviews , implemented in october 2000 , measure state performance against seven standards , including statutory requirements on survey frequency , requirements for documenting deficiencies , timeliness of complaint investigations , and timely and accurate entry of deficiencies into oscar .
cms agreed with our recommendations to revise its past noncompliance policy .
on the basis of statutory requirements , cms defines standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs , and contracts with states to assess , through annual surveys and complaint investigations , whether homes meet these standards .
