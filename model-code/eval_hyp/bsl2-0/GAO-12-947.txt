dhs has initiated broad oversight efforts to improve its procurement of goods and services as well as specific initiatives to reduce procurement costs , such as strategic sourcing .
accordingly , we ( 1 ) assessed dhs's efforts to implement procurement oversight , and ( 2 ) identified dhs components' use of strategic sourcing to leverage their buying power .
the chief procurement officer's strategic plan for fiscal year 2012 to 2014 highlights these efforts and other priorities for improving procurement operations including the oversight activities required to implement the plan .
dhs's office of the chief procurement officer ( ocpo ) established an acquisition oversight program in 2005 to complement dhs's existing acquisition management governance process for major investments .
according to dhs , since the program's inception , it has led to over $1 billion in savings and increased administrative efficiencies .
however , we found that dhs had not updated its procurement oversight policy and guidance to reflect the increased focus on procurement and changes to the original oversight program .
ocpo established a strategic sourcing program in 2003 to leverage dhs's buying power to increase savings and other efficiencies by consolidating requirements , increasing standardization of requirements across components , and enhancing management of commodities or services .
dhs bought over $14 billion in goods and services in fiscal year 2011 — representing over one quarter of its budget — and processed over 100,000 transactions to support its homeland security missions .
the program addressed a broad range of acquisition - and procurement - related issues through four main oversight mechanisms: operational status reviews , on - site reviews , self assessments , and acquisition planning reviews .
management directive 0784 , “acquisition oversight program” ( 2005 ) and the “acquisition oversight program guidebook” ( 2006 ) included policy and guidance for the program , which was designed to provide department - level insight into components' acquisition functions and to identify successful acquisition management approaches .
dhs's recent revision of its policy and guidebook is a step in the right direction , but inconsistencies in the documents as well as with the program as described to us by dhs officials could lead to further confusion , which would diminish the value of the program and opportunities for increased accountability for procurements .
with its initial oversight efforts in 2005 and today's more streamlined procurement oversight approach , ocpo has increased department - level insight into components' procurement operations and recommended ways that components can take steps to improve their overall procurement operations .
to assess dhs's efforts in implementing procurement oversight , we reviewed procurement oversight policies and guidance ; interviewed knowledgeable officials from ocpo and dhs components ; reviewed prior gao reports ; and examined dhs and component documentation of oversight efforts , including ocpo's review schedule , quarterly reports , goal letters , and on - site reviews from 2007 to the present .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is a complex organization responsible for a broad range of mission and management areas , such as border security , immigration services , aviation security , maritime security , and emergency preparedness and response .
