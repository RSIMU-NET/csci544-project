federal agencies obligate more than $100 billion annually using cost - reimbursement contracts .
appropriate government surveillance is also required to provide reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls .
we reviewed relevant sections of the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , implementing agency policies and regulations , our standards for internal control in the federal government , and past gao reports .
to select the agencies included in our review , we analyzed cost - reimbursement contract actions and dollars obligated as reported in the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) .
at your request , we reviewed the federal government's use of cost - reimbursement contracts and identified agencies' reported obligations under these contracts , determined what agencies are buying using cost - reimbursement contracts , assessed contracting officers' rationales for using this contract type and whether analysis is being conducted to determine whether a different contract type is warranted based on experience with the requirement , determined whether contractors' accounting systems had been deemed adequate for determining costs applicable to the contracts , and identified agencies' procedures for surveillance of contractor cost controls .
this helps prevent situations where contractors bill the government for unallowable costs .
based on the fiscal year 2007 data , we grouped agencies into one of three categories: agencies whose obligations under cost - reimbursement contracts were less agencies whose obligations were from 20 to 50 percent , and agencies whose obligations were 51 percent or higher .
fiscal year 2007 fpds - ng data were the latest available at the time we selected the agencies for review , but we subsequently obtained data on cost - reimbursement obligations for fiscal year 2008 and included those data in our trend analysis .
in addition , we interviewed agency procurement policy representatives and heads of contracting activities for 10 agencies from the first category cited above , which had reported a very high use ( 95 percent or more ) of fixed - price contracts , to determine the reasons for their low use of cost - reimbursement contracts .
to mitigate risk and help ensure that the best interests of the government are served when entering into a cost - reimbursement contract , agencies may use this contract type only if the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract .
as such , cost - reimbursement contracts are suitable only when the cost of the work to be done cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed - price contract .
this type of contract is considered high risk for the government because of the potential for cost escalation and because the government pays a contractor's costs of performance regardless of whether the work is completed .
in all , we reviewed 92 contracts or orders issued under cost - reimbursement contracts .
we identified surveillance procedures at the agencies in our review but , because of time constraints , did not assess compliance with those procedures for the 92 contracts and orders .
we reviewed only one contract at the corporation for national and community service and at the department of the treasury's alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau , as those contracts accounted for the totality of those agencies' reported cost - reimbursement contracts in fiscal year 2007 .
