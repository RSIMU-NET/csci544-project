for example , in 2010 congress passed the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) , which includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of financial institutions .
in turn , some said this had begun to adversely affect some lending activities , such as mortgage lending to customers not typically served by larger financial institutions , although the regulations provided exemptions or other provisions to reduce such impacts .
for example , some credit union , community bank , and industry association representatives told us in 2015 that several mortgage - related rules increased their overall compliance burden .
as a result of this act and other actions taken by financial regulators , additional regulatory requirements were placed on financial institutions , including community banks and credit unions .
we previously reported that representatives of community banks and credit unions expressed concerns about the burden that additional regulations create for them .
this report examines ( 1 ) what regulations institutions regarded as most burdensome and why , and ( 2 ) what actions the regulators of these institutions have taken to address any burdens associated with financial regulations .
within the past two decades , financial regulators have implemented many new regulations in the aftermath of events such as the september 2001 terrorist attacks and the financial crisis in 2007 â€“ 2009 , these regulations were intended to address the risks and problematic practices that contributed or led to the events , and included provisions that ranged from strengthening financial institutions' anti - money laundering ( aml ) programs to prevent terrorism financing to creating additional protections for mortgage lending .
these institutions historically have played an important role in serving their local customers , including providing credit to small businesses .
the asset thresholds we used for our sample were $1.2 billion for banks ( which represented 90 percent of banks as of march 2016 ) and $860 million for credit unions ( which represented 95 percent of credit unions as of march 2016 ) .
but surveys conducted by regulators , industry associations , and academics on the impact of the dodd - frank act on small banks suggested that credit availability had been reduced by moderate to minimal amounts among those responding to the various surveys , and regulatory data up to that point had not confirmed a negative impact on mortgage lending .
you asked us to examine the impact of regulation on community banks and credit unions .
we drew our sample from institutions whose characteristics ( such as asset size and activities ) were typical of traditional community banking activities .
the act includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of financial services firms , including consolidating consumer protection responsibilities within cfpb .
to determine what actions regulators took to address regulatory burden , we reviewed the reports the depository institution regulators issued for the 2007 and 2017 economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of 1996 ( egrpra ) reviews .
in addition to this report , we will provide a separate report that addresses the effect of regulatory burden on lending activities by community banks and credit unions , the rate of formation of new institutions , and potential impacts of regulations that we expect to issue to you in spring 2018 .
