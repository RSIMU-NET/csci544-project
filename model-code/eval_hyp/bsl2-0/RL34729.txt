disagreements over whether progress has been made often stem from differences over which indicators are emphasized , such as central government policies , local government actions , civil society , or short - term versus long - term trends .
other analysts and many chinese citizens contend that economic and social freedoms have grown considerably , the government's control over most aspects of people's lives has receded , opportunities for providing opinions on policy have increased , and rights activism has sprouted .
many observers argue that violations of civil liberties and cases of political and religious persecution in china have increased in recent years , the leadership remains authoritarian , and economic development , based largely upon trade with the united states , has strengthened the communist government rather than empowered the people .
in many ways , growing government restrictions on political , religious , and other freedoms and greater assertion of civil rights have occurred simultaneously .
others argue that u.s. engagement has helped to accelerate economic and social change and build social and legal foundations for democracy and the advancement of human rights in the prc .
some analysts contend that the u.s. policy of engagement with china has failed to produce meaningful political reform , and that without fundamental progress in this area , the bilateral relationship will remain unstable .
for many u.s. policy - makers , progress in this area represents a test of the success of u.s. engagement with china , particularly since permanent normal trade relations ( pntr ) status was established in 2000 .
human rights conditions in the people's republic of china ( prc ) remain a central issue in u.s. - china relations .
policy tools include private discussions ; sanctions ; open criticism of prc human rights policies ; coordinating international pressure ; support of and contact with dissidents ; bilateral dialogue ; human rights , democracy , and related programs in the prc ; promoting internet freedom ; public diplomacy efforts ; and monitoring and highlighting human rights abuses .
many u.s. experts and policy makers have disagreed over the best policy approaches , priorities , and methods to apply toward promoting democracy and human rights in china .
foreign operations appropriations measures have prohibited assistance to the united nations population fund from being used to support related programs in china .
differing u.s. goals include effecting fundamental political change in china , on the one hand , and supporting incremental progress , on the other .
they contend that sanctions and linking bilateral cooperation to prc improvements in human rights have not been very effective .
many policy makers suggest that tangible improvements in prc human rights policies should be a condition for full diplomatic and economic relations with china as well as cooperation on other issues .
possible approaches range from placing human rights conditions upon the bilateral relationship to inducing change through bilateral and international engagement .
on the other hand , the prc government has continued to enact laws and policies aimed at reducing some of the most egregious human rights abuses , protecting property and labor rights , and promoting government transparency and citizen input .
in some cases , the prc government has made small concessions in order to help reduce or avoid open u.s. or global criticism .
