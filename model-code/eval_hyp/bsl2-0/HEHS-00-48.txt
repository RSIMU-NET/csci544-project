the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) significantly changed federal policy for aiding low - income families with children .
under tanf , states have increased flexibility to design their programs and are therefore able to build upon initiatives they had begun experimenting with before federal reform .
to ensure they meet these and other requirements , states must also meet new federal program and fiscal reporting requirements .
it ended the 61-year - old aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program , under which eligible families were entitled to ongoing monthly cash assistance , and replaced it with the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant for states .
however , among other provisions , the law also requires that , to avoid financial penalties , states impose work requirements for adults , meet steadily rising requirements for the percentage of adults who participate in work activities , and enforce a 5-year lifetime limit on receiving tanf .
the tanf block grant , administered by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , provides a total of up to $16.5 billion to the states each year through 2002 .
our work and other studies show that states and localities have made progress in implementing key aspects of tanf .
because of the new ways of doing business , the increased number of agencies and service providers involved , and the expanded federal reporting requirements , welfare reform has placed increased demands on state information systems that have traditionally been critical to the successful operation of states' welfare programs .
as specified in prwora , the goals of tanf include ending the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation and work .
