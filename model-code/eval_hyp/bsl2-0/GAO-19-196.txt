according to the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) , the consumer reporting market comprises more than 400 companies , and the consumer data industry association reports that these companies issue three billion reports and make more than 36 billion updates to consumer files each year .
banks , employers , and others use these reports to make credit , employment , insurance , and other decisions .
you asked us to examine issues related to the causes of the equifax breach , equifax's response to the breach , federal oversight of cras , and the role of cras in federal agencies' implementation of government programs .
such unauthorized access to personally identifiable information could lead to identity theft , raising concerns among policymakers about how cras in general are collecting , using , and protecting sensitive consumer information .
we have addressed issues related to data breaches and identity theft in our prior work , including our recent analysis of the equifax data breach .
we reviewed the types of enforcement actions available to ftc and cfpb for violations of relevant laws , as well as specific enforcement actions these agencies have brought against cras .
these companies collect vast amounts of sensitive consumer information , package it into consumer reports , and sell the reports to third parties .
cfpb , created in 2010 by the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) , has enforcement authority over all cras for violations of certain consumer financial protection laws .
in 2017 , the consumer reporting agency ( cra ) equifax , inc. , disclosed that it had experienced a data breach and that unknown individuals had extracted from its databases sensitive consumer information — such as names , addresses , birth dates , and credit card , driver's license , and social security numbers — of at least 145.5 million consumers in the u.s .
according to a 2018 department of the treasury report , the three nationwide cras — equifax , experian , and transunion — maintain credit files on nearly 210 million americans .
as discussed below , these laws include most provisions of the fair credit reporting act ( fcra ) ; several provisions of the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) ; and provisions of the dodd - frank act concerning unfair , deceptive , or abusive acts or practices .
to assess ftc and cfpb measures to enforce information protection provisions and to ensure cras' proper collection , use , and protection of consumer information , we reviewed documents from ftc and cfpb .
