we are addressing this report to the committees of jurisdiction because it identifies problems and calls for corrective action that the department of defense ( dod ) has indicated an unwillingness to take .
the army is responsible for the development , test , production , and fielding of joint stars ground station modules ( gsm ) .
the army and the air force are jointly developing the joint surveillance target attack radar system ( joint stars ) .
because of the cost and importance of the joint stars effort and concerns about the gsms' performance in prior tests , we reviewed the army's test and acquisition plans for the common ground station ( cgs ) , the next gsm version .
we are suggesting that congress may wish to take the necessary action to ensure that dod addresses the problems we have identified .
we conducted this review under our basic legislative responsibilities .
regarding program cost , dod stated that the cgs lrip quantity includes not only the number needed for testing purposes , but considers production rate efficiencies and cost factors .
in light of dod's unwillingness to have the army revise its acquisition strategy for the cgs , congress may wish to take the actions necessary to limit the number of cgs systems to be procured under lrip prior to the cgs successfully completing operational testing .
through fiscal year 2001 , the total cost of the army's joint stars development and acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion .
the army's first year commitment to 18 systems and current plan to acquire 16 systems in the second year raises the estimated 2-year lrip cost to over $153 million .
dod took the position that the acquisition strategy espouses prudent risk in balance with program cost , schedule , and technical requirements .
they include reliability that is significantly less than expectations , systems that cannot meet current specifications , systems that are never fielded and / or retired after fielding because of poor performance , and systems that require significant and expensive post - fielding repairs for faults identified during ot&e .
the cgs acquisition strategy provides for 2 years of lrip , during which the army anticipated buying 22 cgs systems at an estimated cost of about $138 million , though it received approval from dod to procure up to an additional 16 cgs systems to accommodate other service and allied requirements .
the risks of systems starting production before operational tests are conducted are numerous .
it believes that producing only four prior to test would require the stop and restart of production , resulting in loss of skilled people , inefficient use of contractor resources , and higher costs .
while there is an operational need for joint stars , and despite the desire of operational commanders to have more capable systems as soon as possible , the fact remains that the army has not adequately justified the urgency or benefits to be derived from accelerated fielding of the cgs in 1998 versus the originally planned fielding in fiscal year 2002 .
these gsms are to have the ability to supplement this radar data with unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and electronic intelligence reports .
the cgs system is to provide the same functionality as the light gsm with an initial enhancement of the integration of secondary imagery data , and planned additional enhancements provided by post - award contract modifications .
