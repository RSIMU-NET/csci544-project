in a 2002 survey of health plans sponsored by the medicare payment advisory commission ( medpac ) , researchers estimated that medicare payments for anesthesia services were about 61 percent lower than private insurance payments .
congress is concerned that regional differences between medicare and private payments for anesthesia services may create discrepancies in the supply of anesthesia practitioners , which in turn could adversely affect access to services for medicare beneficiaries in some areas .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) the extent to which medicare payments for anesthesia services were lower than private payments across medicare payment localities in 2004 , ( 2 ) whether the supply of anesthesia practitioners across medicare payment localities in 2004 was related to the differences between medicare and private payments for anesthesia services or to the concentration of medicare beneficiaries in these localities , and ( 3 ) compensation levels for anesthesia practitioners compared to other health care practitioners in 2005 and trends in the number of anesthesiology residency positions and the number of graduates of nurse anesthesia programs .
while there have been increases in medicare payments for anesthesia services since the implementation of the physician fee schedule , anesthesia practitioners have maintained that medicare payments for anesthesia services are too low , especially when compared with the payments for such services made by private insurance payers .
in particular , there is a concern that anesthesia practitioners will choose to practice in areas where private payments for anesthesia services are highest relative to medicare payments and avoid areas where medicare beneficiaries are more concentrated relative to the general population .
in contrast , a more recent analysis conducted for medpac of 2004 claims data found that medicare payments for physician services , excluding anesthesia services , were , on average , 17 percent lower than private payments .
however , the difference between medicare and private payments for anesthesia services is larger than the difference in payments for other physician services , raising the concern that medicare payment levels could affect where anesthesia practitioners locate and more generally whether interest in anesthesiology as a profession is also affected .
an analysis of 1992 data by the physician payment review commission ( pprc ) found that medicare payments per service for general and family practitioners increased by 10 percent , while payments per service for surgical specialties decreased by 8 percent overall during this time period .
while we previously reported on the impact of income — of which medicare payments are one source — on physicians' decisions on where to locate and on medicare beneficiary access to physician services , our work did not focus on specific specialists such as anesthesiologists or nonphysician practitioners such as crnas .
to examine the extent to which medicare payments for anesthesia services were lower than private payments , we used 2004 anesthesia service claims data from two billing companies that bill and track payments from private payers and medicare on behalf of anesthesia practitioners .
after the first year the physician fee schedule was in effect , medicare payments for some physician specialties — such as general and family practice — increased while payments for other specialties — such as surgery — decreased .
under the new physician fee schedule , medicare payments for some specialties were expected to increase while payments for other specialties , including anesthesiology , were expected to decrease compared with the payments based on physicians' historical charges .
