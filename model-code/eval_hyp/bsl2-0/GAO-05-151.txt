we evaluated ( 1 ) the effect of the current structure of the e - rate program on fcc's management of the program , ( 2 ) fcc's development and use of performance goals and measures in managing the program , and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of fcc's oversight mechanisms — rulemaking proceedings , beneficiary audits , and reviews of usac decisions ( appeals ) — in managing the program .
thus , any misuse of e - rate funding wastes consumers' money and deprives those schools and libraries whose requests for support were denied due to funding limitations .
as the steward of this program , fcc must ensure that beneficiaries use the funds appropriately and that there is financial and managerial accountability surrounding the fund .
recently , allegations have been made that some e - rate beneficiaries ( schools and libraries ) and service providers ( e.g. , telecommunications and network equipment companies ) have fraudulently obtained , wasted , or abused e - rate funding .
since 1998 , the federal communications commission's ( fcc ) universal service “e - rate” program has committed more than $13 billion in funding to help schools and libraries across the nation acquire telecommunications and internet services .
since 1998 , we have issued eight reports and testimonies discussing various aspects of the e - rate program .
in addition , we interviewed officials from the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the department of education regarding performance goals and measures .
in light of ongoing concerns about the e - rate program , you asked us in december 2003 to review the program .
also , during most of the program's history , the requests from schools and libraries for e - rate funding have greatly exceeded the annual amounts available from the program .
suspected instances of program beneficiaries not paying their portion of service costs and of service provider procurement irregularities are being investigated .
in fact , fcc's inspector general ( ig ) has devoted special attention to the e - rate program in his most recent reports to congress .
the e - rate program processes around 40,000 applications from schools and libraries each year , and many of these applicants rely heavily on e - rate support for their telecommunications needs .
similarly , the state library of louisiana has used e - rate funding to help provide internet connections for use by patrons in all of louisiana's public libraries .
eligible schools and libraries can apply annually to receive support and can spend the funding on specific eligible services and equipment , including telephone services , internet access services , and the installation of internal wiring and other related items .
the telecommunications act of 1996 expanded the concept of universal service to include assistance to schools and libraries in acquiring telecommunications and internet services ; the act charged fcc with establishing a universal service discount mechanism for schools and libraries .
the program is funded through statutorily mandated payments into the universal service fund by companies that provide interstate telecommunications services .
the commission , in turn , created a large and ambitious program that became commonly known as the e - rate program and gave the program a $2.25 billion annual funding cap .
