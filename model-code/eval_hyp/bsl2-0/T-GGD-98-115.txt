this evidence included the ( 1 ) views of professionals knowledgeable about the cpi , ( 2 ) practices of other countries , ( 3 ) results of research that show that the age of expenditure weights affects the cpi , and ( 4 ) the sizable effect more frequent updates could have on the federal budget in comparison to the relatively small costs associated with updates .
would enhance the plans' usefulness and credibility to cpi stakeholders given the great interest shown in the boskin commission recommendations by congress and others .
further , the plan did not fully portray how bls' strategies and resources would help achieve the performance goals for improving cpi quality or how bls would ensure that the data it uses to assess its performance are credible .
gao also examined how well those elements of bls' strategic plan and performance plan that focus on improving the cpi would meet the criteria in the government performance and results act of 1993 and related guidance , even though the bls plans are not required to comply with the statutory requirements .
bls has said it agrees with gao's recommendation for more frequent updates and is considering the appropriate update frequency .
in examining bls' fiscal year 1999 performance plan , gao found that it was partially successful in providing a picture of bls' intended performance to improve the cpi's quality .
as requested by the subcommittee , gao's testimony today addresses certain topics related to the cpi .
the principal source of information on trends in consumer prices and inflation in the united states is the consumer price index ( cpi ) , which is published by the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) .
the preponderance of evidence gao obtained pointed to the need for and advantages of more frequent updates .
the first is the need for bls to make the cpi expenditure weights more current by updating them more frequently than at 10-year intervals , as gao reported in october 1997 .
bls uses expenditure weights to aggregate market basket items into the overall index number .
to determine the level of inflation in consumer prices , the cpi tracks prices for a fixed “market basket” of goods and services that urban consumers purchase for day - to - day living .
the subcommittee has asked us to address several topics related to making the cpi more reflective of current consumer spending .
cbo estimated that , assuming no other changes in policy or economic assumptions , if updating the weights in 2003 ( 5 years after the 1998 major revision ) reduced cpi growth by 0.1 percentage point annually , the projected budget surplus would be increased by a cumulative total of $16.5 billion over the 5-year period of 2004 through 2008 .
only those expenditures made by consumers ( not including businesses ) are captured in the cpi .
we asked the congressional budget office ( cbo ) to use the midpoint of bls' range ( a decrease of 0.1 percentage point ) to estimate the effect on the federal budget .
most of the impact of such a reduction in the cpi would be on federal outlays — such as reduced payments to social security beneficiaries , which account for most of the outlays — and most of the impact would occur in the later years .
