most programs of federal aid to k - 12 education are authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) .
debates over reauthorization of the esea have thus far focused on the following overarching issues: ( 1 ) what has been the impact of the substantial expansion of standards - based assessments of pupil achievement required under the esea , and should these requirements be expanded further to include additional subjects or grade levels ? .
 ( 2 ) are adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) requirements appropriately focused on improving education for disadvantaged pupil groups and identifying low - performing schools ? .
the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 , although esea programs continue to operate as long as appropriations are provided , and the 111 th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea .
the esea was most recently amended and reauthorized by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb , p.l .
 ( 7 ) the nclb , with its numerous new or substantially expanded requirements for participating states and leas , initiated a major increase in federal involvement in basic aspects of public k - 12 education .
