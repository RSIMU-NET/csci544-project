my statement will focus on hud's problems and progress to date in addressing ( 1 ) its long - standing management deficiencies ; ( 2 ) its portfolio of multi - and single - family housing insured by the federal housing administration ( fha ) ; ( 3 ) budget and management problems plaguing the public housing program ; ( 4 ) the spiraling cost of assisted housing programs ; and ( 5 ) the need for consensus on hud reforms .
these problems include how to ( 1 ) reduce excessive housing subsidies and address the physical inadequacies of insured multifamily properties ; ( 2 ) maintain the improved financial health of the single - family insurance fund ; ( 3 ) address the social , management , and budget problems that exist in public housing ; and ( 4 ) deal with the spiraling costs of renewing housing subsidy contracts that assist lower - income families .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss management and budget problems facing the u.s. department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , efforts over the last year to address these problems , and the work that remains .
