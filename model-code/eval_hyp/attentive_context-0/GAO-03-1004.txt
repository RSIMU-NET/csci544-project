our objectives were to evaluate ( 1 ) information on income change reported by reservists when activated for a military operation to determine the need for compensation programs ; ( 2 ) reserve families' readiness for call - ups and their awareness and use of family support programs , specifically focusing on personal financial management ; and ( 3 ) a legislative proposal for the department of defense ( dod ) to offer tricare , the military's health care program , to reservists and their families when members are not on active duty .
dod has not yet identified problems reservists and their families have experienced with access to health care during mobilizations since september 11 , 2001 , such as problems in maintaining continuity of health care ; the causes of these problems ; and their effects on readiness , recruiting , and retention .
some reservists have served for a year or more , and the pace of reserve operations is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future .
dod lacks sufficient information from the survey data to determine the magnitude of income loss or gain experienced by reservists , the causes for this change , and the effects of income loss on reserve retention .
