because of your interest in the status of the forest service's and blm's implementation of stewardship contracting authority , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the status of stewardship contracting projects and the land management goals they address ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the agencies have contracting and financial controls in place that ensure accountability in managing stewardship contracting projects ; ( 3 ) the steps the agencies have taken to involve communities in designing , implementing , and evaluating stewardship contracting projects ; and ( 4 ) each agency's plans for future stewardship contracting activities .
unless the agencies establish a minimum requirement for community involvement in stewardship projects ( to replace the expired requirement for monitoring teams ) and provide project managers with examples of successful community involvement practices other projects have used , the agencies may fail to capitalize fully on the potential of stewardship contracting .
such guidance should identify , and encourage the use of , best practices in seeking and incorporating community input , and establish minimum requirements for seeking community involvement on each stewardship contracting project .
recent severe wildfire seasons have focused attention on the state of our nation's forests .
