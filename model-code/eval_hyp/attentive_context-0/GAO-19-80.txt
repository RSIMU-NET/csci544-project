this report examines ( 1 ) what has been the focus of federal railroad administration's ( fra ) grade - crossing - safety research , ( 2 ) how states select and implement grade - crossing projects and what railroad - and state - reported data are available from fra to inform states' decisions , and ( 3 ) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) assesses the program's effectiveness .
when appropriate , we indicate whether the challenges we summarize are shared by: “some” ( two or three ) ; “many” ( four or five ) ; or “most” ( six or seven ) of the state officials , but frequency is not necessarily indicative of the relative importance of a challenge or consensus , or lack thereof .
