afghanistan's governing structure has historically consisted of a weak central government unwilling or unable to enforce significant financial or administrative mandates on all of afghanistan's diverse ethnic communities or on the 80% of afghans who live in rural areas .
u.s. and international partner policy has been to try to empower these groups to check government power and to entrench afghan democracy .
the taliban government ( 1996-2001 ) opposed modernization , but there has been substantial modernization and urbanization since the taliban were ousted â€” changes that might help afghanistan remain stable after the international involvement in afghanistan ends .
ethnic and rural communities , many of which are divided by mountains and wide expanses , have often looked to local faction leaders for their governance .
to respond to those fears , afghan and u.s. officials say that the outcome of a settlement would require the taliban to drop at least some of its demands that ( 1 ) foreign troops leave afghanistan ; ( 2 ) a new "islamic" constitution be adopted ; and ( 3 ) islamic law be imposed .
since the fall of the taliban , there has also been the growth of a civil society , largely made up of educated afghans , many of whom returned to afghanistan from exile when the taliban fell .
