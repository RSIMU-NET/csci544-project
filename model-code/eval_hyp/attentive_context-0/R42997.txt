recent years have witnessed a growing interest , in congress , in the executive branch , and in the broader policy community , in re - examining how well the u.s. government conducts the business of national security — from decision - making , to strategy - making , to budgeting , to planning and execution , to accountability and oversight .
they suggest that for such cross - cutting issues , more "unified" budgeting approaches could facilitate the identification of overlaps and gaps among agencies' efforts ; enable more deliberate assignment of roles and responsibilities ; catalyze closer collaboration ; and provide greater transparency to help support congressional oversight .
this report describes and characterizes the unified national security budgeting school's broadly shared critique of the current system ; describes and analyzes various proposed unified national security budgeting approaches ; and offers a succinct list of considerations for members and staff of congress who may be interested in this issue .
that interest reflects concerns with effectiveness — how well the u.s. government accomplishes the mission — and with efficiency — how well the u.s. government stewards scarce resources — in the national security arena .
