i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to provide an update on the efforts of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) — a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — to manage preparedness grants and measure and assess national preparedness capabilities .
our work over the last seven years has focused on fema's efforts to coordinate federal interagency preparedness and manage and assess the impact of fema's preparedness grants on state and local preparedness .
following the federal response to hurricane katrina in 2005 , congress enacted the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) .
in fiscal year 2017 , dhs announced the availability of 10 preparedness grant programs totaling more than $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2017 .
according to dhs , from fiscal years 2002 through 2017 the department has awarded over $49 billion to a variety of dhs preparedness grant programs to enhance the capabilities of state , local , tribal , and territorial grant recipients to carry out the above activities related to terrorist attacks and other disasters .
this statement specifically addresses fema's efforts to manage preparedness grants and our prior recommendations .
