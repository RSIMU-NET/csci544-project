i am pleased to be here today to provide the committee with information on diversity of the federal workforce and at the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , which was created from a disparate group of 22 agencies with multiple missions , values , and cultures into a cabinet department whose goals are to , among other things , protect u.s. borders and infrastructure , improve intelligence and information sharing , and prevent and respond to potential terrorist attacks .
because these challenges could have serious consequences for the security of our country , we designated the department's implementation and transformation a high - risk area in 2003 and reiterated our concerns in january 2005 and again in january 2007 .
since its inception in march 2003 , dhs has faced enormous challenges related to protecting the nation from terrorism while organizing its predecessor agencies — several with existing program and management challenges — into a coherent and integrated department .
for our analyses of governmentwide career and dhs career demographic data , we extracted data from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) central personnel data file ( cpdf ) and analyzed these data to identify the extent of changes in the representation of women and minorities in dhs's workforce between september 2003 and september 2007 .
