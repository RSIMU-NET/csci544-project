in particular , we discuss federal agencies' ( 1 ) implementation of chief information officer ( cio ) responsibilities , ( 2 ) fulfillment of cio it acquisition review requirements , ( 3 ) data center consolidation efforts , ( 4 ) management of software licenses , and ( 5 ) cybersecurity .
the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments , which often suffered from ineffective management .
such a program should include risk assessments ; the development and implementation of policies and procedures to cost - effectively reduce risks ; plans for providing adequate information security for networks , facilities , and systems ; security awareness and specialized training ; the testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of controls ; the planning , implementation , evaluation , and documentation of remedial actions to address information security deficiencies ; procedures for detecting , reporting , and responding to security incidents ; and plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations .
in 2018 , we updated this high - risk area to reflect the lack of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for the federal government .
i am pleased to be here today to provide an update on federal agencies' efforts to address our high - risk areas on improving the management of information technology ( it ) acquisitions and operations , as well as ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation .
