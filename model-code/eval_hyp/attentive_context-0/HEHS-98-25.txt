because of these concerns , you asked us to evaluate the food and drug administration's ( fda ) oversight of transplanted human tissue as well as to evaluate potential safety problems .
specifically , we sought to identify gaps in the current regulation , determining whether and how fda plans to address them in the approach it has proposed for regulating tissue banking .
notwithstanding the benefits of tissue transplantation , some are concerned about the potential transmission of infectious diseases from donor to recipient and about certain tissue - processing techniques that may affect the usefulness of tissues or leave them with harmful residues .
in commenting on a draft of this report , fda generally concurred with our recommendations to require ( 1 ) the registration of all tissue facilities with fda , ( 2 ) adherence of reproductive and stem cell facilities to all the requirements in the current regulation , ( 3 ) accurate labeling and promotion by facilities that collect and store cord blood , ( 4 ) disclosure to recipients of genetic tests performed on reproductive tissues , and ( 5 ) validation of systems to track tissues to consignees and recipients .
