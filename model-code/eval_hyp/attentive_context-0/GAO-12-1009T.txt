in general , these challenges are related to ( 1 ) program management and implementation ; ( 2 ) partnerships and collaboration ; ( 3 ) resources , funding , and sustainability ; and ( 4 ) performance measures .
another challenge that dhs and its component agencies have faced in implementing maritime security - related programs has been the lack of adequate performance measures .
for example , from fiscal years 2004 through may 2012 , cbp obligated over $390 million for a voluntary program that enables cbp officials to work in partnership with private companies to review and validate companies' practices for securing their international supply chains .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) and other agencies' implementation of the maritime transportation security act of 2002 ( mtsa ) .
inadequate acquisitions management: dhs has also experienced challenges managing some of its acquisition programs .
ports , waterways , and vessels handle billions of dollars in cargo annually , and an attack on our nation's maritime transportation system could have dire consequences .
an attack on a port could have a widespread impact on international trade and the global economy .
