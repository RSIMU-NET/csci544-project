the hardest hit fund ( hhf ) , created in 2010 , is one of several temporary programs that were established to help prevent home mortgage foreclosures in the wake of housing and mortgage market turmoil that began around 2007-2008 .
it established the troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) , which authorized the secretary of the treasury to purchase or insure up to $700 billion in troubled assets owned by financial institutions .
the special inspector general for the troubled asset relief program ( sigtarp ) provides oversight of tarp programs , including the hhf , in quarterly reports and audit reports .
it provided funding to 19 states ( including the district of columbia ) to design locally tailored initiatives to prevent home foreclosures .
participating states have until december 31 , 2020 to use their hhf funds .
while many of the temporary programs that were established to help households facing foreclosure have since ended , the hhf remains active .
treasury set aside a total of $37.5 billion in tarp funds to use for foreclosure prevention initiatives .
 table 1 shows the 19 states ( including dc ) that received funds through the hhf and the total amount that was allocated to each state through the five rounds of funding .
