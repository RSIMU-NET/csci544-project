this report addresses the extent to which pacom has: ( 1 ) accounted for contractor personnel and has a process to vet foreign vendors in its area of responsibility , ( 2 ) established an organizational structure to manage and oversee ocs , and ( 3 ) integrated ocs into key planning documents .
a key element of department of defense ( dod ) military strategy since 2012 has been a rebalance of u.s presence and capabilities toward the asia - pacific region , u.s. pacific command's ( pacom ) area of responsibility .
to enable pacom to better identify ocs requirements and incorporate those requirements into annex ws and their appendixes , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the pacom commander to develop guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities and the process that should be followed for ocs requirements development .
