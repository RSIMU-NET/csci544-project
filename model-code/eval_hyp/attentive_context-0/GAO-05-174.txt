this report discusses ( 1 ) the extent to which federal housing assistance programs provide benefits to elderly households and what is known about the effectiveness of these programs in assisting the elderly , ( 2 ) the types of supportive services that these programs provide for the elderly , and ( 3 ) how hud and usda avoid overlap and duplication in programs that offer similar types of housing assistance to the elderly .
to determine the extent to which federal housing assistance programs provide benefits to elderly households , we first identified the relevant programs through a literature search , review of the catalog of federal domestic assistance , and consultation with department of housing and urban development ( hud ) and department of agriculture ( usda ) officials .
we included housing assistance programs that ( 1 ) subsidize mortgage interest rates , rent , or housing repair or rehabilitation ; ( 2 ) provide mortgage insurance , loan guarantees , or direct loans for single - family or multifamily housing ; or ( 3 ) support the construction , rehabilitation , or purchase of multifamily housing or assisted living facilities .
according to the 2003 american housing survey sponsored by the u.s. department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , nearly one - third of elderly households — generally those whose head is aged 62 or older — were experiencing housing affordability problems .
