the decision in school district of the city of pontiac v. secretary of the united states department of education arose in response to litigation surrounding ยง 9527 ( a ) of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind ( nclb ) act of 2001 .
enacted in 2002 , the nclb act reauthorized and revised the esea , which is the primary federal law that provides financial assistance to state and local school districts for pre - collegiate education .
for example , congress could choose to amend the nclb act to clarify that states that accept nclb funds are obligated to comply with all of the act's requirements , regardless of whether or not the costs of compliance are fully funded by the federal government .
arguing that the costs of complying with some of the new accountability measures far outweigh what they receive in federal funds , a number of states and school districts have protested what they perceive as a lack of federal assistance for some of the act's more controversial requirements , such as the testing and school choice provisions .
for example , the act mandates that states administer annual tests in reading and mathematics for students in grades 3-8 , requires that schools make adequate yearly progress toward improving student performance , establishes a series of required actions for schools that fail to meet such performance standards , and adds new requirements regarding teacher qualifications .
