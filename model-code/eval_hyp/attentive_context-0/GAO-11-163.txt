for this report , we focused on military medical support for contingency operations in iraq and afghanistan , and as such , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) dod has assessed its need for military medical personnel to support ongoing operations , ( 2 ) the army has adapted the composition and use of its medical units to provide advanced medical care , and ( 3 ) the army fills medical personnel gaps that arise in theater .
to enhance medical units' preparedness to conduct current and future operations given the changing use of combat support hospitals and forward surgical teams in iraq and afghanistan , we recommend that the secretary of the army direct the army medical department to update its doctrine and the organization of medical units concerning their size , composition , and use .
for all three objectives , we augmented our document analysis by interviewing dod and service officials , including officials from united states forces - iraq and united states forces - afghanistan ; u.s. central command ; joint forces command ; joint staff ; office of secretary of defense for health affairs ; offices of the surgeons general for the army , the navy , and the air force ; and u.s. marine corps headquarters .
