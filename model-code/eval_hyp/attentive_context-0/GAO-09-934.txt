based on your request , our objectives are to ( 1 ) describe , for select case study countries that take a territorial approach , what types of foreign - source income the countries exempt and the rules governing those exemptions ; and ( 2 ) describe , to the extent information is available , the compliance risks and taxpayer compliance burdens that the taxation of foreign - source corporate income presents for each of these countries .
compared to the extensive examination of economic effects , little has been done to study whether there are important differences between worldwide and territorial systems in terms of tax administration and , more specifically , in terms of compliance by taxpayers and taxpayers' compliance burden ( recordkeeping , reporting , and other costs ) .
