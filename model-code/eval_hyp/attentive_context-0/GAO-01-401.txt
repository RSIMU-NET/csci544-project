our objectives were to ( 1 ) examine how task force hawk's concept of operation compared to army and joint doctrine , ( 2 ) review the lessons learned identified from the operation and determine the status of actions to address those lessons , and ( 3 ) examine the extent to which the army and the air force were able to operate together as a joint force .
