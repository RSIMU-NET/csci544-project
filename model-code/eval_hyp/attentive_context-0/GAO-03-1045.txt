at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 , over 400,000 claims for disability compensation and pension benefits were waiting for veterans benefits administration ( vba ) decisions .
in response , we assessed ( 1 ) how accuracy may have changed since vba increased its emphasis on production and ( 2 ) how well vba ensures the accuracy of its decisions .
during fiscal year 2002 , vba increased its claims decisions by two - thirds from about 481,000 to about 797,000 and reduced its inventory of pending claims by about one - fifth from about 421,000 to about 346,000 .
in order to improve the timeliness of its disability claims decisions , vba established a goal of completing about 839,000 decisions in fiscal year 2002 and reducing its inventory of pending claims to about 316,000 by the end of that year .
we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for benefits to report the accuracy of vba disability compensation and pension claims decisions to the congress and other stakeholders in a manner that allows for valid comparisons of accuracy across fiscal years and better hold regional offices accountable for the accuracy of their claims decisions , by increasing the use of its regional office accuracy data , while at the same time maintaining an appropriate emphasis on production .
