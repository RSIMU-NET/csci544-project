numerous allegations and complaints about the poor quality of appraisals conducted for the purposes of mortgage insurance issued by the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) have raised concerns about the fha appraisal process .
to improve hud's oversight of lenders participating in fha's programs , we recommend that the secretary of hud ( 1 ) determine the department's authority to hold fha - approved lenders accountable for poor - quality fha appraisals performed by the appraisers they select from fha's roster and ( 2 ) issue policy guidance that sets forth the specific circumstances under which and actions by which hud may exercise this authority .
hud's revision of its appraisal guidance and forms and its plans to test appraisers on their knowledge of fha appraisal requirements are likely to help appraisers perform their work in accordance with fha standards .
our objectives were to answer the following questions: ( 1 ) how well is the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) monitoring the performance of the appraisers on its roster and implementing procedures for addressing consumers' complaints about federal housing administration ( fha ) appraisals ? .
