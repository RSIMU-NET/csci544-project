akey concept embodied in the accountability provisions of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb , p.l .
107-110 ) is that of adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) toward proficiency on state assessments .
in order to maintain eligibility for grants under esea title i , part a — grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) for the education of disadvantaged pupils , the largest federal k - 12 education program — states must establish and implement standards of ayp that are applicable to all public schools and leas in the state , as well as the state overall .
the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 , and the 111 th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea .
substantial interest has been expressed in the use of growth models to meet the ayp requirements of the nclb .
schools or leas that fail to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years face a variety of consequences and , ultimately , corrective actions .
in december 2007 , the secretary lifted the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model pilot , and regulations published in october 2008 incorporate this expanded policy .
