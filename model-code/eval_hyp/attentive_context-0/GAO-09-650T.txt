i will focus my testimony today on three primary issues: ascr's ( 1 ) resolution of discrimination complaints , ( 2 ) reporting on minority participation in usda programs , and ( 3 ) strategic planning for ensuring usda's services and benefits are provided fairly and equitably .
for decades , usda has been the focus of federal inquiries into allegations of discrimination against minorities and women both in the programs it administers and in its workforce .
equal employment opportunity commission , usda's office of inspector general ( oig ) , gao , and others have described extensive concerns about discriminatory behavior in usda's delivery of services to program customers — in particular , minority farmers — and its treatment of minority employees .
given the new administration's commitment to giving priority attention to usda's civil rights problems , various options may provide a road map to correcting long - standing management deficiencies that have given rise to these problems .
specifically , raising the public profile for transparency and accountability through means such as a statutory performance agreement between the secretary of agriculture and the assistant secretary for civil rights , a civil rights oversight board , and an ombudsman for addressing customers' and employees' civil rights concerns would appear to be helpful steps because they have proven to be effective in raising the performance of other federal agencies .
