one law that has been the subject of particular scrutiny has been the national environmental policy act of 1969 ( nepa ; 42 u.s.c .
factors that may contribute to delays in a federal project include changes in the planning and design process , changes in funding priorities , construction complexities , local controversy or community opposition to a project , and compliance with myriad local , state , tribal or federal laws .
as a result of the debate between stakeholders regarding nepa's implementation , numerous administrative and legislative actions have been proposed to expedite compliance with nepa .
the perception that compliance with environmental requirements results in extensive delays and additional costs to the successful delivery of federal projects can be magnified when compliance with multiple environmental laws and regulations is required ( as would likely be the case with large , complex federal projects ) .
with regard to the latter , certain federal actions such as highway construction projects and permitting for mining operations , cattle grazing , forest thinning , and energy development projects may trigger compliance with literally dozens of statutory and regulatory requirements .
signed into law by president nixon on january 1 , 1970 , nepa declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a council on environmental quality ( ceq ) in the executive office of the president .
