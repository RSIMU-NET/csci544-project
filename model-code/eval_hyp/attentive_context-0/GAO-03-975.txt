for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 , the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) budget for 20 capacity - building and technical assistance programs was over $860 million .
to assist you with your oversight of the section 4 capacity - building program , you asked us to describe how funding under section 4 of the hud demonstration act of 1993 has evolved and expanded over the years , how grantees use section 4 funding , and what other federal funding is available for capacity building ; determine the importance of section 4 funding to private sector involvement in community development initiatives ; and determine how hud and section 4 grantees control the management and measure the impact of section 4 programs .
since its inception in 1993 , the program has provided capacity - building funds and services to over 1,590 local organizations in more than 783 cities nationwide , either through direct grants or substantial technical assistance activities .
all four grantees currently have initiatives that focus on these areas .
of these funds , almost $150 million was specifically designated to build the capacity of local community development and affordable housing organizations through the section 4 program .
