as requested , we reviewed the cost of the department of defense's ( dod ) environmental cleanup efforts at bases being closed under the base realignment and closure ( brac ) process .
specifically , this report addresses the ( 1 ) cost of cleanup efforts , ( 2 ) reasons that cleanups are so costly , and ( 3 ) potential opportunities for reducing costs and their impact on programmatic goals .
they cited a number of reasons for this situation , including ( 1 ) difficulty in determining the fair market value of property to be transferred , ( 2 ) little incentive for investors to assume the risks of unknown liabilities , and ( 3 ) stipulations that the transferee gives up the right for future indemnification if further contamination is found .
in the earlier years of the brac program , the congress had expressed concern about dod's slow progress in obligating funds for environmental cleanup .
finally , previous dod estimates were generally understated .
although dod does not have readily available data that show overall funding devoted to studies at brac bases , officials have stated that the amount has been substantial .
