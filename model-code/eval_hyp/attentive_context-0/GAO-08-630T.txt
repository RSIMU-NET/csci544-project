as requested , our testimony today , will discuss ( 1 ) the age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce ; ( 2 ) the strategies federal agencies are using to recruit , hire , and retain older workers ; and ( 3 ) our observations on how these strategies position federal agencies to engage and retain older workers .
in reviewing strategies federal agencies use to recruit , hire , and retain older workers , we interviewed officials in selected agencies , including the departments of agriculture , housing and urban development ( hud ) , labor , and state , as well as the internal revenue service ( irs ) , environmental protection agency ( epa ) , nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , and the social security administration ( ssa ) .
consequently , it is incumbent upon opm to continue to work with federal agencies to help ensure they have ( 1 ) the flexibilities they need to attract and retain a diverse workforce that includes older workers ; ( 2 ) the awareness of these flexibilities , as well as guidance and technical assistance needed to implement them ; and ( 3 ) mechanisms to share best practices and lessons learned in attracting and retaining older workers .
