f ederal law provides a variety of powers for the president to use in response to crisis , exigency , or emergency circumstances threatening the nation .
congress may modify , rescind , or render dormant such delegated emergency authority .
others — statutory delegations from congress — exist on a standby basis and remain dormant until the president formally declares a national emergency .
some of these authorities , deriving from the constitution or statutory law , are continuously available to the president with little or no qualification .
they are not limited to military or war situations .
in 1976 , congress curtailed this practice with the passage of the national emergencies act .
until the crisis of world war i , presidents utilized emergency powers at their own discretion .
these activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the vietnam war .
during world war i and thereafter , chief executives had available to them a growing body of standby emergency authority that became operative upon the issuance of a proclamation declaring a condition of national emergency .
proclamations announced the exercise of exigency authority .
sometimes such proclamations confined the matter of crisis to a specific policy sphere , and sometimes they placed no limitation whatsoever on the pronouncement .
