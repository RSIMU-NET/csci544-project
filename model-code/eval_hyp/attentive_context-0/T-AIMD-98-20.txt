we are pleased to be asked to provide our views on the progress being made by the national credit union administration ( ncua ) in ensuring that automated information systems belonging to the thousands of credit unions that ncua oversees are ready for the upcoming century date change .
we also reviewed ncua correspondence to credit unions and third - party contractors ( that provide automated systems services to many credit unions ) regarding the year 2000 problem .
if the year 2000 problem is not addressed in time , credit union computer systems — which affect billions of dollars of assets and transactions — will be unable to readily process transactions or produce accurate information .
finally , we interviewed officials from the credit union national association , the national association of state credit union supervisors , and the cuna mutual group ( which provides liability insurance for the credit union industry ) .
this testimony is the first in a series of reports you requested on the status of efforts by federal financial regulatory agencies to ensure that the organizations they oversee are ready to handle the year 2000 computer conversion challenge .
in performing the overview , we interviewed ncua officials responsible for examining and overseeing the safety and soundness of credit union management practices and procedures .
