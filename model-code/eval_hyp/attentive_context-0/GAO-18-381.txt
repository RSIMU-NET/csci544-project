this report examines ( 1 ) how agencies estimate both the burden hours and costs of their information collections , and any limitations of their approaches , and ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies consult with and receive comments from the public on the collections' estimated burden .
to accomplish this , the act requires agencies to ( 1 ) justify , or describe the necessity , of the information collected ; ( 2 ) provide estimates of the burden they will impose ( i.e. , the time and costs required to comply with the collection ) ; and ( 3 ) publish notices in the federal register and otherwise consult with the public to obtain input .
for example , the internal revenue service ( irs ) collects information from individuals and businesses to help taxpayers meet their tax responsibilities and help irs enforce the law with integrity and fairness .
