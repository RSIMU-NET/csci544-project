two main goals of the law were to facilitate participation in recreation and "to strengthen the health and vitality" of u.s. citizens .
for instance , one 115 th congress bill would have authorized lwcf funding for certain programs and activities of the major land management agencies , including deferred maintenance , critical infrastructure , visitor services , and clean - up efforts ; the payments in lieu of taxes program ; and certain offshore energy exploration , innovation , and education activities .
some traditional lwcf advocates and beneficiaries have expressed concern about expanding the use of the funds , particularly if such expansion results in lower appropriations for land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states .
the lwcf receives additional revenue ( beyond the $900 million ) from ocs leasing under the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 ( gomesa ) .
of the total revenues that have accrued throughout the program's history ( $40.9 billion ) , less than half have been appropriated ( $18.9 billion ) through fy2019 .
the land and water conservation fund ( lwcf ) act of 1965 was enacted to "assist in preserving , developing , and assuring accessibility to ... outdoor recreation resources. .
