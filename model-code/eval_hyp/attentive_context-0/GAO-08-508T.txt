my testimony today is the second in a series of interim reports on sbi implementation and focuses on the following issues: the extent to which border patrol agents have been trained and are using sbinet technology ; sbi tactical infrastructure implementation ; and how the sbi program office has defined its human capital goals and the progress it has made to achieve these goals .
securing the nation's borders from illegal entry of aliens and contraband , including terrorists and weapons of mass destruction , continues to be a major concern .
although the department of homeland security ( dhs ) apprehends hundreds of thousands of people entering the country illegally each year , several hundreds of thousands of individuals also enter the united states illegally and undetected .
finally , as mandated in the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , we are examining dhs's fiscal year 2008 expenditure plan for the sbi program and also expect to report to congress in spring 2008 .
one component is the u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) sbi program office which is responsible for developing a comprehensive border protection system using people , technology , known as sbinet , and tactical infrastructure â€” fencing , roads , and lighting .
