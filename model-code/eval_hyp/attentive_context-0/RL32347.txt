accordingly,the department of defense ( dod ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , whichis the department of energy ( doe ) agency in charge of the u.s. nuclear weapons program,requested funds to study the robust nuclear earth penetrator ( rnep ) .
the report , released in april 2005 , had nine key conclusions: ( 1 ) many high - value buriedfacilities can be held at risk by nuclear but not conventional epws ; ( 2 ) penetration to a depth of 3meters captures most effects of epws on buried targets ; deeper penetration puts the weapon atgreater risk ; ( 3 ) epws cannot penetrate deeply enough to contain nuclear weapon effects fully ; ( 4 ) casualties from a nuclear weapon burst at shallow depth or on the surface are essentially the same ; ( 5 ) detonating a nuclear weapon at shallow depth increases the energy transmitted to a buried target,permitting a reduction in yield by a factor of 15 to 25 ; ( 6 ) attacks using nuclear epws near urbanareas could produce thousands to over a million casualties , or hundreds to several hundred thousandfor attacks in rural areas ; ( 7 ) a nuclear epw could reduce civilian casualties in an urban area by afactor of 2 to 10 compared to a surface - burst weapon with 25 times the yield ; ( 8 ) a nuclear weaponwould have to detonate within a chamber where chemical or biological agents were stored to destroythe agents ; the same is true of nonnuclear "thermobaric" bombs , which generate high heat andpressure ; and ( 9 ) in a nuclear attack on a chemical weapon facility , nuclear effects would probablykill many more civilians than would the released chemical agent , while a nuclear attack on abiological facility could kill similar numbers of civilians from nuclear effects and released biologicalagents , depending on weapon yield and amount of agent .
