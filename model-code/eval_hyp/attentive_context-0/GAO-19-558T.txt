my testimony today discusses ( 1 ) factors contributing to the tax gap and ( 2 ) strategies for reducing the tax gap .
developing and documenting plans to assess its nrp employment tax study results would help irs ( 1 ) identify areas of noncompliance , ( 2 ) devise actions to address such noncompliance , and ( 3 ) update its employment tax gap estimate .
the tax gap has been a persistent problem for decades , and enforcement of tax laws has been on our high risk list since its inception in 1990 .
the most recent data available show that , in 2016 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) estimated an average annual gross tax gap of $458 billion for tax years 2008 to 2010 .
for example , just a 1 percent reduction of the 2008-2010 average annual net tax gap would have resulted in about $4 billion more in annual revenue for those years .
for illustrative purposes , for fiscal year 2019 , this amount of revenue could fund about 82 percent of irs's enforcement budget ; the entire operation of the u.s. census bureau ; or the combined federal budgets of the national park system operations account , smithsonian institution , and the national archives and records administration .
