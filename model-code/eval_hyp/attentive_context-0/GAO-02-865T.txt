to prepare this testimony , we reviewed ( 1 ) the reorganization and reprogramming documents submitted by the department of justice ( doj ) to this subcommittee on may 29 , 2002 ; ( 2 ) our prior work on organization transformation and on the fbi ; ( 3 ) studies of counterterrorism and / or fbi operations conducted by various commissions , an advisory panel , doj's office of inspector general , and a management consultant ; ( 4 ) strategic plans and other related documents developed by the bureau and doj ; and ( 5 ) pertinent press releases and congressional testimony by doj and fbi officials .
first , it is very important to recognize that the fbi's reorganization efforts represent a subset of a larger need to fundamentally transform the federal government in light of recent trends and long - range fiscal challenges .
there are , in fact , specific areas relating to the reorganization and realignment that might warrant more in - depth review and scrutiny , including ( 1 ) progress in developing a new strategic plan ( 2 ) a review of broader human capital issues , ( 3 ) fbi uses of the funds appropriated to fight terrorism , ( 4 ) measurement of performance and results , ( 5 ) the implementation of the attorney general's revised guidelines , and ( 6 ) the upgrading of information technology and analytic capacity .
