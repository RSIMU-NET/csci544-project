in this report , we ( 1 ) summarize available information on the threats and risks from terrorism that u.s. chemical facilities face ; ( 2 ) describe federal requirements for security preparedness and the safe management of chemicals at these facilities ; ( 3 ) describe actions federal agencies have taken to assess the vulnerability of the chemical industry or to address security preparedness ; and ( 4 ) describe the voluntary actions the chemical industry has taken to address security preparedness , and the challenges it faces in protecting its assets and operations .
this national strategy should identify high - risk facilities based on factors including the level of threat and collect information on industry security preparedness ; specify the roles and responsibilities of each federal agency partnering with the chemical industry ; develop appropriate information sharing mechanisms ; and develop a legislative proposal , in consultation with industry and other appropriate groups , to require these chemical facilities to expeditiously assess their vulnerability to terrorist attacks and , where necessary , require these facilities to take corrective action .
in order to ensure that chemical facilities take action to review and address security vulnerabilities , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security and the administrator of epa jointly develop , in consultation with the office of homeland security , a comprehensive national chemical security strategy that is both practical and cost effective .
