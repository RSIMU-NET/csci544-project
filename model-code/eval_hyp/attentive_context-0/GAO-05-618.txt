given your interest in these issues , we are providing you with information about ( 1 ) the extent to which students with disabilities were included in statewide assessments ; ( 2 ) what issues selected states faced in implementing alternate assessments ; and ( 3 ) how the u.s. department of education ( education ) supported states in their efforts to assess students with disabilities .
in the 2003-04 school year , more than 6 million students with disabilities — approximately 13 percent of all students — attended u.s. public schools .
in an effort to improve the academic achievement of all students , including those with disabilities , the no child left behind act ( nclba ) of 2001 requires that states , districts , and schools are held accountable for their students' academic performance .
questions have been raised , however , about the extent to which students with disabilities have been included in statewide assessments and whether these assessments accurately reflected student performance .
finally , we recommend that the secretary of education work with states , particularly those with high exclusion rates , to explore strategies to reduce the number of students with disabilities who are excluded from the naep assessment .
