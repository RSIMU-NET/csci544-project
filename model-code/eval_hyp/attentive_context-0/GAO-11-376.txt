to strengthen usda's oversight of the safety of food purchased by its commodity program and served in federal school meal programs , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture instruct the commodity program to take the following three actions: develop a systematic and transparent process to determine whether foods offered by the program require more - stringent specifications related to microbial contamination , including steps to: identify pathogens , strains of pathogens , or other foods that merit more - stringent specifications ; document the scientific basis used to develop the specifications ; and review the specifications on a periodic basis ; share information with school districts in a more explicit form regarding the foods covered by more - stringent purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination to enable districts to make more informed choices ; and issue more specific guidance to states and school districts regarding the applicability of the regulatory requirement for food safety inspections to schools that do not prepare food .
accordingly , our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which federal purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for food in the commodity program differ from federal regulations for the same foods available in the commercial marketplace ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the commodity program's purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for raw ground beef differ from those imposed by some large federal and private - sector purchasers ; and ( 3 ) examples of standards and practices that exist at the state and school district level to help ensure that food procured by schools is safe .
