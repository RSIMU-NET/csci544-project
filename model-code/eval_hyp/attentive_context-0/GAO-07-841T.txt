specifically , we examined how fra ( 1 ) focuses its efforts on the highest priority risks related to train accidents in planning its safety oversight , ( 2 ) identifies safety problems on railroad systems in carrying out its oversight , and ( 3 ) assesses the impact of its oversight efforts on safety .
fra uses a broad range of goals and measures to assess the impact of its oversight efforts on safety .
although the overall safety record in the railroad industry , as measured by the number of train accidents per million miles traveled , has improved markedly since 1980 , there has been little sustained improvement over the past decade .
it includes initiatives to address the two main causes of train accidents — human factors and defective track — and fra has pursued some additional initiatives to address these causes since issuing the plan .
our work was based on a review of laws , regulations , and fra plans and guidance as well as discussions with fra officials and with a range of external stakeholders , including railroads , unions , and state railroad safety organizations .
our work focused on fra oversight efforts to reduce the rate of train accidents rather than those to reduce highway - rail crossing and trespassing accidents because ( 1 ) the department of transportation's inspector general has recently assessed efforts to reduce highway - rail crossing accidents and ( 2 ) trespassing accidents primarily involve issues not related to railroad safety performance .
