s ince the u.s. small business administration's ( sba's ) creation in 1953 , the sba disaster loan program has provided low - interest disaster loans to businesses to help them repair , rebuild , and recover from federally declared disasters .
for example , from fy2014 to fy2018 , $3.35 billion was spent on post - disaster mitigation grants through fema's hazard mitigation grant program ( hmgp ) and fire management assistance grants ( fmags ) .
for example , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) provides both pre - disaster and post - disaster mitigation grants to states and localities , but post - disaster mitigation grants are substantially larger than pre - disaster grants .
sba business disaster loans fall into two categories: ( 1 ) economic injury disaster loans ( eidl ) , and ( 2 ) business physical disaster loans .
in contrast , during the same period , $430 million was spent on fema's pre - disaster mitigation ( pdm ) program ( see figure 1 ) .
eidls provide up to $2 million for working capital to help small businesses meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have been met had the disaster not occurred .
