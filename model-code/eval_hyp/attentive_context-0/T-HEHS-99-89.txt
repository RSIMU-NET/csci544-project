on the existence of serious deficiencies in nursing home compliance with medicare and medicaid standards .
on the basis of statutory requirements , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) defines standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs and contracts with states to certify that homes meet these standards through annual inspections and complaint investigations .
