we also interviewed ice and contractor headquarters officials regarding ( 1 ) how ice has structured the atd program and how ice officials decide which aliens to place in the atd program and at what supervision level ; ( 2 ) how ice officials determine when to terminate an alien from the atd program or one of the program's components ; ( 3 ) changes to program implementation over time , including future plans ; and ( 4 ) benefits and challenges of the program .
the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is responsible for such oversight and implemented the alternatives to detention ( atd ) program in 2004 to be a cost - effective alternative to detention that uses case management and electronic monitoring to ensure adult aliens released into the community comply with their release conditions — including requirements to appear at immigration court hearings — and comply with final orders of removal from the united states .
to strengthen ice's management of the atd program and ensure that it has complete and reliable data to assess and make necessary resource and management decisions , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the deputy assistant secretary of ice to take the following two actions: analyze data on changes in supervision levels and program terminations to monitor ero field offices' implementation of ice guidance intended to ensure cost - effective management of the program , and require that field offices ensure that ice or contractor staff collect and report data on alien compliance with court appearance requirements for all participants in the technology - only component of the atd program .
