the indian health service ( ihs ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is charged with providing health care services to the approximately 2.1 million american indians and alaska natives who are members or descendants of federally recognized tribes .
in an effort to ensure that ihs has meaningful information on the timeliness with which it issues purchase orders authorizing payment under the chs program and to improve the timeliness of payments to providers , we recommend that the secretary of hhs direct the director of ihs to: modify ihs's claims data system to separately track ihs referrals and self - referrals , revise the gpra measure for the chs program so that it distinguishes between these two types of referrals , and establish separate timeframe targets for these referral types ; and improve the alignment between chs staffing levels and workloads by revising its current practices , where appropriate , to allow available funds to be used to pay for chs program staff .
