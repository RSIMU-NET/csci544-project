the decision of whether to issue this permit has provided ( and continues to provide ) a rallying point for environmental groups who have voiced various concerns over the construction of the pipeline and / or further development of the oil sands .
for these stakeholders , the presidential permit decision has been seen as a gauge of the administration's support for reducing domestic fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions .
proponents of the keystone xl pipeline , including high - level canadian officials and u.s. and canadian petroleum industry stakeholders , base their arguments supporting the pipeline primarily on increasing the security and diversity of the u.s. petroleum supply and economic benefits , especially jobs .
if constructed , the pipeline would transport crude oil ( e.g. , synthetic crude oil or diluted bitumen ) derived from oil sands resources in alberta , canada , to refineries and other destinations in the united states .
the proposed keystone xl pipeline has received considerable attention in recent months .
the presidential permit application — submitted by transcanada — for the pipeline's construction represents a singular decision made by the administration about whether or not the pipeline would serve the national interest .
