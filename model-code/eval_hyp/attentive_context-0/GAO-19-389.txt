management evaluations .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
the administrator of the food and nutrition service should establish a process to plan and conduct regular fraud risk assessments for the school meals programs that align with the leading practices in the fraud risk framework .
we examined these processes against the leading practices in a framework for managing fraud risks in federal programs ( fraud risk framework ) related to assessing fraud risks .
the fraud risk framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt .
to address our first objective , we reviewed the results of the most recent access , participation , eligibility , and certification ( apec ) study — which usda uses to estimate improper payments in the school meals programs — published in may 2015 , as well as estimated improper payment error rates and actions aimed at reducing them reported in usda's agency financial reports from fiscal years 2015 through 2018 .
