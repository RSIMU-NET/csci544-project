our objectives were to ( 1 ) examine the design characteristics of these programs that have implications for flexibility , accountability , and programs' ability to collect information about performance as envisioned in the results act ; ( 2 ) identify the kinds and sources of performance information that programs with various characteristics have utilized and the strengths and weaknesses of this information ; and ( 3 ) provide guidance to legislators and agency officials concerning the information collection options available for programs with various designs .
with block grant proposals on the horizon in education and other areas and the first performance plans now in under the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra or the results act ) , this topic could hardly be more timely .
congress today faces the difficult question: can grant programs be designed to promote flexibility at the state or local level as in traditional block grants , yet still provide the information needed to ensure accountability and support federal policy decisions ? .
the study covered 21 programs in diverse policy areas , from transportation to community mental health .
in response to your request , we conducted a comparative study of block grants and similar programs that give state or local governments substantial flexibility in determining how funds are to be used .
