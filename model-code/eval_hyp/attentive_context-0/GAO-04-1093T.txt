this testimony addresses ( 1 ) the specific efforts of u.s. agencies to improve intellectual property protection in other nations , ( 2 ) the means used to coordinate these efforts , and ( 3 ) challenges facing the enforcement efforts abroad .
with a broad mandate under its authorizing legislation , niplecc has struggled to establish its purpose and unique role .
the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property through means such as copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
as a result , u.s. goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy in many countries .
these challenges include the need to create political will overseas , recent technological advancements that facilitate the production and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods , and powerful economic incentives for both producers and consumers , particularly in developing countries .
key activities to develop and promote enhanced ipr protection in foreign countries are undertaken by the departments of commerce , homeland security , justice , and state ; the fbi ; uspto ; the copyright office ; and usaid .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on u.s. efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property rights ( ipr ) overseas and our recent report on this topic .
