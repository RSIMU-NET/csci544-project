we recommend that the administrator , epa , take the following four actions: ensure that states verify , on a regular basis , that tank owners and operators are maintaining adequate financial responsibility coverage , as required by rcra ; improve the agency's oversight of the solvency of state assurance funds to ensure that they continue to provide reliable financial responsibility coverage for tank owners ; assess , in coordination with the states , the relative effectiveness of public and private options for financial responsibility coverage to ensure that they provide timely funding for the cleanup of releases ; and better focus how epa distributes program resources to states , including lust trust fund money , by ensuring that states are reporting information in their semiannual activity reports that is consistent with epa's definitions ; encouraging states to review their databases to ensure that only data on the appropriate universe of underground storage tanks are being reported in their semiannual activity reports ; and gathering available information from states on releases attributed to tanks without a viable owner and taking this information into account in distributing lust trust fund money to states .
the objectives of this review were to provide information on ( 1 ) states' estimates of the cost in public funding from state and federal sources to clean up known releases from underground storage tanks , ( 2 ) states' primary sources of funding for addressing these releases and their future viability , and ( 3 ) the funding available from federal sources to address these releases .
