today , my testimony will provide , for the 33 federal courthouses completed since 2000 , preliminary results of our review of: ( 1 ) whether the courthouses contain extra space and any costs related to it , ( 2 ) how the actual size of the courthouses compares with the congressionally authorized size , ( 3 ) how courthouse space based on the judiciary's 10-year estimates of judges compares with the actual number of judges , and ( 4 ) whether the level of courtroom sharing supported by data from the judiciary's 2008 study of district courtroom sharing could have changed the amount of space needed in these courthouses .
over the last 15 years , we have raised concerns about gsa's and the judiciary's process for planning new courthouses , including concerns over limited controls and oversight over courthouse construction costs .
since the early 1990s , the general services administration ( gsa ) and the federal judiciary ( judiciary ) have undertaken a multibillion - dollar courthouse construction initiative that has resulted in 66 new courthouses or annexes , with 29 additional projects in various stages of development .
however , rising costs and other federal budget priorities threaten to stall the initiative .
