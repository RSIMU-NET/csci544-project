we examined: ( 1 ) the state of development of v2v technologies and their anticipated benefits ; ( 2 ) the challenges , if any , that will affect the deployment of these technologies , and what actions , if any , dot is taking to address them ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the potential costs associated with these technologies for automobile manufacturers and consumers .
specifically , we are examining: ( 1 ) the progress of development of connected vehicle technologies that involve vehicle - to - vehicle communications and their anticipated benefits ; ( 2 ) the challenges that affect the development and deployment of these technologies and their potential costs ; and ( 3 ) how the u.s. department of transportation is leading efforts to address these challenges .
to address all of our objectives , we reviewed documentation of the efforts of the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) and automobile manufacturers related to vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) technologies , such as the department's its strategic research plan , 2010 - 2014 progress update 2012 and documentation on completed and ongoing research .
for example , according to the department of transportation's ( dot ) national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) , 5.3 million police - reported vehicle crashes occurred in the united states in 2011 , resulting in about 32,000 fatalities and more than 2.2 million injuries .
