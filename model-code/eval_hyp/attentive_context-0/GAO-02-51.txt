recurring problems in managing its programs and projects plagued the department of energy ( doe ) to such a degree in the late 1980s and early 1990s that some observers , including gao , called for a rethinking of the department's missions and structure .
of the more than 225 reports identified , we selected 121 that addressed doe corporate management functions , including strategic planning ; information technologies ; retaining , recruiting and training staff ; security ; environment , safety and health practices ; contracting ; program and project management ; and national laboratory reform .
while many of doe's reforms have achieved their immediate objectives , weaknesses persist and have been linked to wide - ranging performance problems , including major cost overruns and schedule delays in a variety of noteworthy projects .
concerned about the progress that doe has made to strengthen its management in recent years , you asked us to describe actions taken by doe to improve its performance in the early to assess doe progress since then in addressing management weaknesses and improving performance , and identify any underlying impediments to more effective management and improved performance at doe .
doe also has a role in helping to ensure the security of the nation's energy infrastructure .
