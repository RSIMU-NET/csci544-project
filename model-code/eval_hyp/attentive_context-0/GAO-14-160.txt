to help ensure that federal contracting officials have complete and timely information about the performance of contractors , the fema administrator should determine the extent to which cpars assessments have not been completed for fema contracts ; identify the reasons why cpars assessments were not completed ; and develop additional actions as needed to address the reasons to help ensure that assessments ( ratings ) for fema contractors are reported in cpars on a timely and consistent basis .
to help ensure fema's contract monitoring provides a consistent , structured , and transparent method to assess contractor services , the fema administrator should determine the extent to which quality assurance surveillance plans have not been developed for fema contracts ; identify the reasons why quality assurance surveillance plans were not developed ; and develop additional actions as needed to address the reasons to help ensure that quality assurance surveillance plans are developed for its future awards .
to assess how fema followed its monitoring procedures , we collected data across three key areas: training and ethics requirements for contracting officer's representatives ( cor ) ; performance measures ; and ongoing monitoring and reporting .
while fema has begun to consider how to address the lack of a quality assurance surveillance plan for the bsa contract and to enter risk map contractor performance assessments into cpars , we are making two recommendations aimed at improving monitoring and reporting of contractor performance .
