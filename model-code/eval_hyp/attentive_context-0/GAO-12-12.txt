in fiscal year 2010 , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , which operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation , provided health care to about 5.2 million veterans .
to support employers who may interact with veterans who have mental health conditions , va has developed a set of online resources , including information on postdeployment mental health issues and information on mental health care available through va .
recent legislation has increased many oef / oif veterans' priority for accessing va's health care .
to corroborate the barriers we identified in the literature , we interviewed officials from ( 1 ) several va offices — the office of mental health services , the office of mental health operations , the office of rural health , the office of research and development , and readjustment counseling services ; ( 2 ) several mental health – focused va research centers — the mental illness research , education and clinical center , the serious mental illness treatment resource and evaluation center , the center for chronic disease outcomes research , and the national center for ptsd ; ( 3 ) several va mental health and primary care providers ; and ( 4 ) a judgmental sample of vsos .
