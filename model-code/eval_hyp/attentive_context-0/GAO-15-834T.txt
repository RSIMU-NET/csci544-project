regulatory guidance is an important tool that agencies use to communicate timely information about the implementation of regulatory and grant programs to regulated parties , grantees , and the general public .
to conduct that work , we reviewed guidance processes at 25 components that engaged in regulatory or grant - making activities in four departments — agriculture ( usda ) , education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , and labor ( dol ) .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) defines the term “guidance document” as an agency statement of general applicability and future effect , other than a regulatory action , that sets forth a policy on a statutory , regulatory , or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue .
guidance documents can vary — by type , purpose , and amount — among agencies and subcomponents of the same agency , and have often been reported to outnumber regulations in terms of the number of documents issued annually .
the potential effects of these documents — and the risks of legal challenges to agencies — underscore the need for consistent and well - understood processes for the development , review , dissemination , and evaluation of guidance .
