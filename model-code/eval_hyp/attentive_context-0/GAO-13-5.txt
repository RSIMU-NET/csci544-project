these reports prompted broader questions about whether the departments of defense ( dod ) and veterans affairs ( va ) were fully prepared to meet the needs of the growing number of servicemembers and veterans returning from recent conflicts .
this should include holding the joint executive council accountable for ensuring that key issues affecting recovering servicemembers and veterans get sufficient consideration , including recommendations made by the warrior care and coordination task force and the recovering warrior task force ; developing mechanisms for making joint policy decisions ; involving the appropriate decision - makers for timely implementation of policy ; and establishing mechanisms to systematically oversee joint initiatives and ensure that outcomes and goals are identified and achieved .
in 2009 , congress required dod to establish a task force to assess the effectiveness of dod programs and policies developed to assist recovering servicemembers and to make recommendations for the dod task continuous improvements of such policies and programs .
however , wwctp's ability to oversee the rcp , including its ability to monitor program performance and ensure compliance with dod policy , is limited by its lack of operational authority , such as budget and tasking authority , over the military services that implement the program .
