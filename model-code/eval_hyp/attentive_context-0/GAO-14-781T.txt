to prepare this statement , we relied on our previously published work on ntis ; related updates on actions needed to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in the federal government ; and a review of legislation pertaining to ntis's role .
for example , the agency's strategic plan for 2011-2016 identified three initiatives to address declining product revenue , which include creating new and enhanced products and increasing the breadth and depth of its collection .
this information largely takes the form of research reports acquired from federal agencies and their contractors and grantees , as well as from other domestic and foreign sources .
the current legislation presents an opportunity for congress to reconsider and modify this role , taking into account the public's interest in accessing technical , scientific , and engineering information produced by the federal government .
ntis has recognized this situation and has conducted analyses and identified actions to address the decline in revenue from its products .
we found that for fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2011 , ntis had net earned revenues from all its functions ( products and services ) for 8 of these 11 years .
