i am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the veterans benefits administration's ( vba ) efforts to modernize its operations by streamlining its business processes and taking greater advantage of information technology .
successfully meeting this challenge is key to improving critical services to almost 27 million veterans and their dependents and lowering vba's operating costs .
unless vba takes more aggressive action to effectively address its serious management and technical weaknesses , its modernization efforts will not succeed .
while it is clear that dedicated employees at vba who care about veterans and service delivery are working to overcome these difficulties , major , sustained improvements in critical service delivery and operating performance have eluded vba .
vba is , however , experiencing many of the classic , fundamental management and technical problems that have prevented federal agencies from realizing the benefits expected from substantial investments in information technology .
these are: creating a credible business strategy and supporting information resources developing a much improved investment strategy for selecting and managing its portfolio of information technology projects in a more disciplined , businesslike manner ; and strengthening its technical capability to develop software applications that will be critical to supporting efforts to improve service to veterans and control costs .
