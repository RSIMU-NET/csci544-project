medicare , a federal health insurance program administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , spent about $6.4 billion in 2016 on fee - for - service ( ffs ) payments for durable medical equipment ( dme ) .
to achieve savings and address improper payment concerns , congress — through the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 — directed that cms change the way it pays for dme and other items in certain areas of the country by implementing a competitive bidding program ( cbp ) .
hhs provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate .
according to the 2018 medicare trustees report , in 2017 , 33.6 million , or about 63 percent of the total 53.4 million medicare enrollees , were enrolled in the medicare ffs part b program that helps pay for dme items , such as oxygen , wheelchairs , hospital beds , and walkers , if they are medically necessary and prescribed by a physician .
however , both we and the hhs office of inspector general have reported that medicare and its beneficiaries sometimes paid higher than market rates for various dme items , and there were long - standing concerns about the high rates of improper payments related to dme .
