over 600 million people travel by air each year in the united states , and the screening of airline passengers and their carry - on and checked baggage is vital to securing our transportation security system .

the aviation and transportation security act , enacted in november 2001 , established the transportation security administration ( tsa ) and significantly changed how passenger and checked baggage screening is conducted in the united states .
tsa has not yet assessed the impact of these initiatives on hiring and retention , but plans to do so during fiscal year 2007 .
this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) how does tsa ensure that its staffing allocation model provides a sufficient number of tsos to perform passenger and checked baggage screening at each airport and what challenges has it faced while implementing the model ? .
as a result , tsa hired and deployed about 55,000 federal passenger and baggage transportation security officers ( tso ) — formerly known as screeners — to more than 400 airports nationwide based largely on the number of screeners that the air carrier contractors had employed .
