the federal government is one of the world's largest and most diverse entities , with about $3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2013 , funding an extensive array of programs and operations .
my statement today focuses on ( 1 ) gao's work related to the president's management agenda , and ( 2 ) additional opportunities for decision makers to address major management challenges .
in responding to the varied and increasingly complex issues the federal government seeks to address , it faces a number of significant fiscal , management , and governance challenges .
my comments are primarily based upon our published and ongoing work covering gao's high risk list ; fragmentation , overlap and duplication reports ; and managing for results work .
expanding strategic sourcing .
a number of areas on the president's management agenda are consistent with issues highlighted by our work on the high risk program , our annual reports on fragmentation , overlap , and duplication , and other work related to long - standing management challenges .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss efforts under way to address major management challenges facing the federal government , as well as opportunities for the administration and congress to make further progress moving forward .
