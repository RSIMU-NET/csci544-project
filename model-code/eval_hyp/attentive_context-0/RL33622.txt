in the new context of fidel's provisional transfer of power to his brother raúl , observers have advocated two general policy approaches to contend with cuba's transition process: 1 ) a stay - the - course or status - quo approach that would maintain the u.s. dual - track policy of isolating the cuban government while providing support to the cuban people ; and 2 ) an approach aimed at influencing the cuban government and cuban society through increased contact and engagement .
these fit into three broad categories: the continuation of a communist government ; a military government ; or a democratic transition or fully democratic government .
as a result , in a proclamation signed by fidel , raúl castro became first secretary of the communist party , commander in chief of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) , and president of the council of state and government , top positions that fidel had held .
over the years , although u.s. policymakers have agreed on the overall objective of u.s. policy toward cuba — to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island — there have been contrasting schools of thought about how to achieve that objective .
