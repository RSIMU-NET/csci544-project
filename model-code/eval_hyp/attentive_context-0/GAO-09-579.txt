provide guidance to contracting officials on the requirements in far section 12.207 for the detailed d&f for t&m or labor - hour contracts for commercial services and encourage agencies to provide training regarding the d&f requirement .
the objectives of this review were to assess ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies have reported using time - and - materials ( t&m ) contracts and general services administration ( gsa ) schedule t&m orders for commercial services and what they are acquiring using this contract type , ( 2 ) the degree to which agencies complied with the far part 12 safeguards and ( 3 ) the applicability of these safeguards to the gsa schedule program .
to help ensure that the risks associated with t&m contracts are understood and that safeguards are followed and to ensure consistency in the use of t&m contracts regardless of which part of the far authorizes their use , we recommend that the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy take the following three actions: amend far subpart 16.6 ( t&m , labor - hour and letter contracts ) and far subpart 16.2 ( fixed - price contracts ) to make it clear that contracts with a fixed hourly rate and an estimated ceiling price are t&m or labor - hour contracts , not fixed - price - type contracts and amend far subpart 8.4 ( pertaining to the gsa schedules program ) to explicitly require the same safeguards for commercial t&m services — i.e. , the far part 12 d&f and the justification for changes to the ceiling price — - that are required in far section 12.207 .
