we recommended that ondcp ( 1 ) strengthen internal controls ; ( 2 ) ensure that funded grant applicants satisfy statutory eligibility criteria ; and ( 3 ) more clearly define its own and samhsa's roles and responsibilities .
this report addresses: ( 1 ) the extent to which ondcp and samhsa use leading practices to coordinate program administration and the types of activities the dfc support program recently funded ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which ondcp's and samhsa's operating procedures both ensure dfc grantees comply with governing statutes and provide a basis for performance monitoring .
to better ensure grantees' compliance with the drug - free communities support program's statutory requirements and to strengthen monitoring of grantee activities , we recommend that samhsa take the following two actions: develop an action plan with time frames for addressing any deficiencies it finds through its reviews and making systemic changes to mitigate deficiencies on a prospective basis to strengthen the grant monitoring process , and develop and implement a method for ensuring that the grantee status reports it provides to ondcp are complete and accurate .
as the number of youth who engage in illicit drug use remains a public health concern , the continued focus on funding grantees and monitoring them for both progress and compliance is vital .
