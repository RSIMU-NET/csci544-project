congress will likely consider whether the proposed transition is in the best interest of the united states and in the best interest of the internet .
to assess whether the iahc proposal should be supported by the u.s. government , the executive branch created an interagency group to address the domain name issue and assigned lead responsibility to the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) of the department of commerce ( doc ) .
the internet is often described as a "network of networks" because it is not a single physical entity but , in fact , hundreds of thousands of interconnected networks linking hundreds of millions of computers around the world .
as part of its examination , congress will likely continue assessing to what extent ongoing and future intergovernmental telecommunications conferences constitute an opportunity for some nations to increase intergovernmental control over the internet , and how effectively ntia and other government agencies ( such as the state department ) are working to counteract that threat .
computers connected to the internet are identified by a unique internet protocol ( ip ) number that designates their specific location , thereby making it possible to send and receive messages and to access information from computers anywhere on the internet .
