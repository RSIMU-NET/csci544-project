in july 1998 , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) — the federal agency with responsibility for managing medicare and medicaid and overseeing compliance with federal nursing home quality standards — launched a series of actions intended to address many of the weaknesses we identified .
significant weaknesses in federal and state nursing home oversight that we identified in a series of reports and testimonies since 1998 included ( 1 ) periodic state inspections , known as surveys , that understated the extent of serious care problems due to procedural weaknesses , ( 2 ) considerable state delays in investigating public complaints alleging harm to residents , ( 3 ) federal enforcement policies that did not ensure deficiencies were addressed and remained corrected , and ( 4 ) federal oversight of state survey activities that was limited in scope and effectiveness .
several areas that require cms's ongoing attention include ( 1 ) the newly established standard performance reviews to ensure that critical elements of the review , such as assessing states' ability to properly document deficiencies , are successfully implemented , ( 2 ) the successful modernization of cms's data system by 2005 to support the survey process and provide key information for monitoring state survey activities , ( 3 ) the planned expansion of comparative surveys to improve federal oversight of the state survey process , ( 4 ) the survey methodology redesign intended to make the survey process more systematic , ( 5 ) the development of more structured guidance for surveyors to address inconsistencies in how the scope and severity of deficiencies are cited across states , and ( 6 ) the provision of detailed guidance to states to ensure thorough and consistent complaint investigations .
