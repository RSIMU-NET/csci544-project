as agreed , today we will discuss ( 1 ) challenges va faces in formulating its health care budget and ( 2 ) some issues surrounding the possibility of providing advance appropriations for va health care .
for our 2006 report on va's overall health care budget for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , we analyzed and reviewed budget documents , including va's budget justifications for health care programs for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , and interviewed va officials responsible for va health care budget issues and for developing budget projections .
va formulates its health care budget by developing annual estimates of its likely spending for all of its health care programs and services .
va estimated that in fiscal year 2009 , its health care programs would serve 5.8 million patients with appropriations of about $41 billion .
this argues for spending time both defining what the problem ( s ) to be solved are and analyzing the impact of any proposed change ( s ) .
in the federal budget , spending is divided into two main categories: ( 1 ) direct spending , or spending that flows directly from authorizing legislation — this spending is often referred to as “mandatory spending” — and ( 2 ) discretionary spending , defined as spending that is provided in appropriations acts .
