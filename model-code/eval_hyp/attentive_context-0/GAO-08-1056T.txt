today , my testimony will focus on our preliminary observations related to ( 1 ) how vha used miscellaneous obligations during fiscal year 2007 , and ( 2 ) whether va's policies and procedures are designed to provide adequate controls over the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations .
according to the department of veterans' affairs ( va ) policy , miscellaneous obligations can be used to record estimated obligations to facilitate the procurement of a variety of goods and services , including fee - based medical and nursing services ; beneficiary travel ; and for other purposes .
in addition , va's office of inspector general ( oig ) issued a report in may 2007 on the alleged mismanagement of funds at the va boston healthcare system .
in the briefing , vha officials disclosed that $4.8 billion ( 56 percent ) of the reported $8.6 billion in procurements through the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 had been done using funds categorized as miscellaneous obligations .
in light of these concerns , you requested that we review whether the design of vha's internal controls over the use of miscellaneous obligations was adequate for fiscal year 2007 .
