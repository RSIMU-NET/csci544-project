the hong kong special administrative region ( hong kong , or hksar ) held elections for its expanded , 70-member legislative council ( legco ) on september 9 , 2012 , ending an 11-month period in which the city also elected members to its district councils and selected leung chu - ying ( cy leung ) as its new chief executive .
in the past , funds were appropriated for the promotion of democratic practices in the city , and congress may decide to continue to appropriate such funds .
conversely , if the chinese communist party ( ccp ) seeks to forestall further democratic reforms in hong kong , it may signal the ccp's opposition to changes in its political system .
the 2012 election results may have raised the risk of a political stalemate for democratic reforms in hong kong .
the process of selecting the new chief executive and the results of the 2012 legco elections , however , may foretell problems for hong kong's prospects for democracy .
congress may choose to assess and possibly assist the prospects for democracy in hong kong .
the conduct of the 2012 elections and the possibility of additional political reforms are indicators of the chinese government's commitment to the basic law and its support for the democratic reforms within a territory over which it exercises sovereignty .
