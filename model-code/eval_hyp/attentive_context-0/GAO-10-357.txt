the department of defense ( dod ) , the department of state ( state ) , and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) have relied extensively on contractors in iraq and afghanistan to undertake reconstruction projects , provide security for u.s. government officials and facilities , and support u.s. forces .
specifically , we analyzed ( 1 ) the extent to which dod , state , and usaid rely on contractors to perform administration functions for other contracts and grants in iraq and afghanistan ; ( 2 ) the reasons behind decisions to use contractors to perform these functions and whether the decisions are guided by strategic workforce planning ; and ( 3 ) whether the agencies have considered and mitigated conflict of interest and oversight risks related to contractors performing contract or grant administration functions .
to improve state's ability to mitigate risks related to potential personal conflicts of interest among personal services contractors , we recommend that the secretary of state clarify the department's policies regarding the application of federal ethics laws to personal services contractors .
