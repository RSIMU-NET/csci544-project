the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that the federal budget deficit for fy2009 was $1,414 billion , triple the $459 billion deficit recorded in fy2008 .
cbo estimates that , in fy2009 , the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) resulted in additional outlays of $112 billion and a drop in revenues of $88 billion , which raised the budget deficit $200 billion above what it otherwise would have been .
cbo expects the deficit for fy2010 to be $1,349 billion .
compared to the overall economy , the $1.4 trillion budget deficit equaled 9.9% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
the budget deficit in fy2009 was , in dollar terms , unprecedented .
the economy is expected to begin to recover in 2010 , but deficits are likely to remain high for some time both because of continued countercyclical fiscal policy and because reducing the deficit as soon as the economy begins to recover could have an undesired contractionary effect .
whether the debt - to - gdp ratio is on such an explosive path depends on the rate of interest and the rate of growth of gdp .
