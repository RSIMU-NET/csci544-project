to further simplify the es penalty process for taxpayers , we recommend that congress amend section 6621 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( b ) of the internal revenue code to include the periods june 15 through june 30 , september 15 through september 30 , and january 1 through january 15 .
in 1996 , about 5.9 million taxpayers were assessed almost $1.1 billion in estimated tax ( es ) penalties .
the internal revenue service's ( irs ) taxpayer advocate's annual report to congress in 1996 described the es penalty rules as extraordinarily complex , and it characterized the form 2210 used for calculating es penalties as one of the most difficult forms taxpayers have to complete .
this report , which we prepared under our basic legislative responsibilities , identifies ( 1 ) internal revenue code and irs administrative requirements that cause some of the complexity associated with es penalty calculations and ( 2 ) the likely effects of corresponding changes to the requirements that would make it easier for taxpayers to calculate their es penalties .
the interest rate used to compute the penalty is based on the federal short - term interest rate , which is subject to change the first day of each quarter , that is , january 1 , april 1 , july 1 , and october 1 .
