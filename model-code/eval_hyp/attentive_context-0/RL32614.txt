continuing appropriations acts ( commonly known as continuing resolutions or crs ) , which provide interim funding in the event that regular appropriations have not been enacted , have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades .
finally , a continuing resolution may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year .
whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations acts for a fiscal year is incomplete , an issue that arises is the appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used .
alternatively , continuing resolutions may have a longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections , or through the beginning of the next congressional session .
continuing resolutions may have a relatively short duration , based on the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks .
this report provides information on congressional practices with respect to the duration of continuing resolutions , including the use of full - year measures , and focuses particularly on the period covering fy1998-fy2012 .
in most of the years in which continuing resolutions have been used , a series of two or more have been enacted into law .
