today , my testimony will focus on two areas: ï‚· hhs reported estimated improper payments in the medicare program for fiscal year 2010 , and the status of cms's efforts to implement key strategies to help remediate improper payments in the medicare program .
we supplemented that prior work with additional information on the nature and extent of medicare improper payments reported by hhs in its fiscal year 2010 agency financial report ( afr ) .
in addition , the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 , contains provisions designed to help reduce improper payments in the medicare program .
we have reported that an agency should have policies and procedures to ensure that ( 1 ) the findings of all audits and reviews are promptly evaluated , ( 2 ) decisions are made about the appropriate response to these findings , and ( 3 ) actions are taken to correct or resolve the issues promptly .
cms is the agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) responsible for administering the medicare program and leading efforts to reduce medicare improper payments .
