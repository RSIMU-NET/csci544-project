if congress concludes that more federal intervention is needed to alleviate vulnerabilities due to geographic concentration , it may employ a number of policy options to encourage geographic dispersion ( including eliminating policies that encourage concentration ) , ensure survivability , or ensure that effective infrastructure recovery capabilities are in place to mitigate impacts of concentrated infrastructure disruption .
since september 11 , 2001 , legislators , government agencies , and industry increasingly have been focused on the sources of infrastructure vulnerability and potential measures to address those vulnerabilities through operational changes and capital investment .
the federal government has a key role in helping protect the nation's critical infrastructure from all types of hazards through programs of mitigation , preparedness , response , and recovery .
accordingly , congress has a strong interest in the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to natural hazards , accidents , or terrorism .
critical infrastructure is so vital to the united states that its incapacity would harm the nation's physical security , economic security , or public health .
in addition to these issues , congress may assess how geographic infrastructure vulnerability and survivability fit together in the nation's overall infrastructure policies .
