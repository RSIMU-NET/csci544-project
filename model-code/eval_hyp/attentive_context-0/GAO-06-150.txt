our objectives were to describe ( 1 ) the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) actions to develop an overall strategy for protecting the chemical industry ; ( 2 ) dhs's efforts to identify high - risk chemical facilities , assess their vulnerabilities , ensure that facilities are addressing security , and coordinate with the environmental protection agency ( epa ) in these efforts ; ( 3 ) chemical industry security initiatives and challenges ; and ( 4 ) dhs's existing authorities , and whether additional legislative authority is needed to ensure that chemical facilities take action to address vulnerabilities .
specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) dhs's actions to develop an overall strategy for protecting the chemical industry ; ( 2 ) dhs's efforts to identify high - risk chemical facilities , assess their vulnerabilities , ensure that facilities are addressing security , and coordinate with epa in these efforts ; ( 3 ) chemical industry security initiatives and challenges ; and ( 4 ) dhs's existing authorities and whether additional legislative authority is needed to ensure that chemical facilities take action to address vulnerabilities .
because completion of the chemical sector - specific plan is critical to dhs's efforts to enhance chemical facility security , we recommend that the secretary of the department of homeland security direct dhs to take the following two actions: ensure that the chemical sector - specific plan is completed in a timely recognizing epa's expertise in managing chemical risks , jointly study with epa whether chemical facilities' efforts to reduce vulnerabilities would benefit from the use of technologies that substitute safer chemicals and processes , referred to as â€œinherently safer technologies. .
