to increase d - snps' accountability and ensure that cms has the information it needs to determine whether d - snps are providing the services needed by dual - eligible beneficiaries , especially those who are most vulnerable , the administrator of cms should take the following four actions: require d - snps to state explicitly in their models of care the extent of services they expect to provide , to increase accountability and to facilitate evaluation ; require d - snps to collect and report to cms standard performance and outcome measures to be outlined in their models of care that are relevant to the population they serve , including measures of beneficiary health risk , beneficiary vulnerability , and plan performance ; systematically analyze these data and make the results routinely available to the public ; and conduct an evaluation of the extent to which d - snps have provided sufficient and appropriate care to the population they serve , and report the results in a timely manner .
to describe how d - snps worked with state medicaid agencies , we analyzed all of the 124 contracts between d - snps and state medicaid agencies that were submitted to cms for 2012 to determine whether the contracts contained provisions expressly addressing benefit integration and care coordination for dual - eligible beneficiaries between the d - snp and the state medicaid agency .
