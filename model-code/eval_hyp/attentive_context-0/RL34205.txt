the federal government provides elementary and secondary education and educational assistance to indian children , either directly through federally funded schools or indirectly through educational assistance to public schools .
the federal government considers its indian education programs to be based on its trust relationship with indian tribes , a responsibility derived from federal statutes , treaties , court decisions , executive actions , and the constitution ( which assigns authority over federal - indian relations to congress ) .
the bureau of indian education ( bie ) in the u.s. department of the interior ( doi ) oversees the federally funded bie system of elementary and secondary schools .
indian children , as enrollees in public education , are also eligible for the federal government's general programs of educational assistance , but such programs are not indian education programs and will not be discussed in this report .
federal indian education programs are intended to serve indian children who are members of , or , depending on the program , are at least second - degree descendants of members of , one of the 567 tribal entities recognized and eligible for funding and services from the bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) by virtue of their status as indian tribes .
