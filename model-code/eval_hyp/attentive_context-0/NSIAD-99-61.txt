in february 1998 , we reported that the department of defense ( dod ) did not have receipts for about 60 percent of its 21 million shipments to end users in fiscal year 1997 .
because the act calls for us to review the dod plan and implementation , we will continue to monitor dod's efforts to develop its overall plan and be in a position to assess its implementation .
more specifically , we ( 1 ) identified the reported value and types of inventory in transit within and between storage and repair activities , vendors , and end users that were unaccounted for ( or lost ) and ( 2 ) assessed the navy's adherence to procedures for controlling such in - transit inventory .
our prior reports have pointed out deficiencies in dod's existing accounting and related systems , including its logistics systems .
among the dod components , the navy was responsible for almost one - half of dod's 12.4 million unacknowledged receipts .
our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify the reported value and types of inventory in transit within and between storage and repair activities , vendors , and end users that were unaccounted for ( or lost ) and ( 2 ) assess the navy's adherence to procedures for controlling such in - transit inventory .
