for a number of years , the department of defense has been researching and developing defenses against ballistic missile attacks on the united states , its deployed forces , friends , and allies .
however , there has been no independent verification of these claims .
in 1990 , the department awarded research and development contracts to three contractors to develop and test exoatmospheric kill vehicles .
however , the differences may not be fully understood or there may not presently be methods to predict the differences .
however , neither project officials nor contractors could provide us with documentation of these communications .
the phase one engineering team was tasked by the national missile defense joint program office to assess the performance of trw's software and to complete the assessment within 2 months using available data .
the department planned to use the best of the three vehicles in a follow - on missile defense program .
specifically , the test was designed to determine if the sensor could operate in space ; to examine the extent to which the sensor could detect small differences in infrared emissions ; to determine if the sensor was accurately calibrated ; and to collect target signature data for post - mission discrimination analysis .
