hurricane katrina , which made landfall along the gulf coast of louisiana and mississippi on august 29 , 2005 , was one of the largest natural disasters in our nation's history , disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals who suddenly lacked housing and access to basic health care services .
this report presents results of our work examining: ( 1 ) how cms allocated the dra funds to states , ( 2 ) the extent to which states have used dra funds , and ( 3 ) whether alabama , louisiana , mississippi , and texas anticipate the need for additional funds after dra funds are expended .
during the first 3 weeks after the hurricane , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , which oversees the medicaid program , announced that states could apply for demonstration projects — to be approved by cms — through which the federal government would fund its share of expenditures for health care services for certain individuals affected by the hurricane .
the states most directly affected by the hurricane — alabama , louisiana , and mississippi — were among the poorest areas in the united states , even before hurricane katrina hit .
