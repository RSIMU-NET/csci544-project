at your request , we examined ( 1 ) the federal role in supporting congestion pricing , ( 2 ) results of congestion pricing projects in the united states , and ( 3 ) emerging issues in congestion pricing projects .
many efforts have been made to assess the effects of congestion pricing projects on equity , including income equity ( the distribution of costs and benefits of congestion pricing between low - and high - income drivers ) and geographic equity ( the relative effects of congestion pricing on two geographic areas , including the effects of any traffic diversion ) .
many americans spend frustrating hours each year stuck in congested traffic , a situation that costs the country billions of dollars annually and influences people's decisions about where to live and work .
concerns on the part of public and elected officials about the fairness of congestion pricing to all users have , however , been a challenge to instituting these projects .
as traffic has risen dramatically over the past 3 decades with population and economic growth , congestion now extends to more times of the day , more roads , and more cities and towns â€” thus affecting more people than ever before .
