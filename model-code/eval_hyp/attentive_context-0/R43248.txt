the expert agencies charged with implementing the relevant statutes — the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and the copyright office — have had to determine if and how to apply the law to technologies and circumstances that were not considered by congress .
the telecommunications act of 1996 ( 1996 act ) , the most recent comprehensive revision of that framework , is virtually silent with respect to internet protocol ( ip ) , broadband networks , and online voice , data , and video services .
three broad , interrelated policy issues are likely to be prominent in any policy debate over how to update the statutory framework: how to accommodate technological change that already has taken place and , more dynamically , how to make the framework flexible enough to accommodate future technological change ; given that underlying scale economies allow for only a very small number of efficient facilities - based network competitors , how to give those few network providers the incentive to invest and innovate while also constraining their ability to impede downstream competition from independent service providers who must use their networks ; and given that spectrum is an essential communications input , how to implement a framework that fosters efficient spectrum use and management .
