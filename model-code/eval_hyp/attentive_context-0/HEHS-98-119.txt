therefore , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) what elements are considered important to a system for processing hmo member complaints and appeals ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hmos' complaint and appeal systems contain these elements ; ( 3 ) what concerns consumers have regarding hmo complaint and appeal systems ; ( 4 ) what information is available on the number and types of complaints and appeals hmos receive from their members ; and ( 5 ) how , if at all , hmos use their complaint and appeal data .
a recent survey of consumers shows that many people experience difficulties with their health plans .
enrollees who become dissatisfied with aspects of their health care can send signals to their health plan in several ways .
for example , some states require that hmos resolve member appeals of decisions within certain time periods ( for example , 20 days ) ; some have required that hmos allow members the option of having complaints and appeals reviewed by an external , independent panel .
several hmos provided information on some elements but not others .
however , provisions in state laws vary considerably .
