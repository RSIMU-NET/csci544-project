for this report , we ( 1 ) identified the actions taken by dod to improve the quality and timeliness of past performance information and implement provisions of the act , and ( 2 ) assessed the effectiveness of those actions .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on thousands of contractors to perform a broad array of activities needed to meet its mission .
we also interviewed dod officials responsible for contractor past performance information at the office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics ; the three dod components — the air force , army , and navy — which account for more than 90 percent of dod's required assessments ; and the contractor performance assessment reporting system ( cpars ) and past performance information retrieval system ( ppirs ) program offices to discuss actions taken or planned .
although compliance with the reporting requirements for performance assessments has increased , dod still faces challenges with completing assessments on time .
therefore , complete and timely information regarding contractor's past performance is critical to ensuring that the government does business with companies that deliver quality goods and services on time and within budget .
