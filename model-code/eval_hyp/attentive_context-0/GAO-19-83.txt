currently , only about 5 percent of rare diseases have treatments approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
we are making the following recommendation to fda: the commissioner of fda should ensure that information from orphan drug designation applications is consistently recorded in oopd review templates and evaluated by oopd reviewers when making an orphan designation decision .
