in that report , we analyzed fiscal year 2005 contracts and other vehicles for the acquisition of personal information from information resellers by the departments of justice , homeland security ( dhs ) , and state and the social security administration ( ssa ) .
as you are aware , the ease and speed with which people's personal information can be collected by information resellers from a wide variety of sources and made available to government and other customers has accelerated with technological advances in recent years .
the provisions of the privacy act , in turn , are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information , known as the fair information practices , which were first proposed in 1973 by a u.s. government advisory committee .
recent security breaches at large information resellers such as choicepoint and lexisnexis have raised questions about how resellers and their federal customers handle people's personal information â€” especially whether their practices are fully consistent with widely accepted practices for protecting the privacy and security of personal information .
these principles , with some variation , are used by organizations to address privacy considerations in their business practices and are also the basis of privacy laws and related policies in many countries , including the united states , germany , sweden , australia , new zealand , and the european union .
