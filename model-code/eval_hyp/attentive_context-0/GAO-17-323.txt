to ensure the department and the shipbuilders have sufficient knowledge of the frigate's anticipated cost and design during the procurement process , the secretary of defense should direct the secretary of the navy to delay frigate procurement plans and the award of the lead frigate contract until at least fiscal year 2019 when cost estimates will be completed , detail design could be underway , and significant progress will have been made in demonstrating through testing the operational capabilities of lcs that are relevant to the frigate .
this report assesses ( 1 ) the extent to which the frigate's planned capabilities offer improvements , if any , over the lcs ; and ( 2 ) the navy's plans for the frigate acquisition as well as remaining opportunities for oversight .
those prices have not yet been achievable .
to ensure sound frigate procurement decisions , congress should consider not enacting authority pursuant to the navy's request for a block buy of 12 frigates in the fiscal year 2018 budget and consider delaying funding of the lead frigate until at least fiscal year 2019 when sufficient cost , design , and capability knowledge is expected to be available to inform decisions .
