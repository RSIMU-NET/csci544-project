the united states has sought to help bangladesh with its development goals , including in the areas of sustainable development , health , education , poverty reduction , disaster preparedness , and food security .
according to the u.s. department of state's 2016 human rights report : the most significant human rights problems [in bangladesh] were extrajudicial killings , arbitrary or unlawful detentions , and forced disappearances by government security forces ; the killing of members of marginalized groups and others by groups espousing extremist views ; early and forced marriage ; gender - based violence , especially against women and children ; and poor working conditions and labor rights abuses .
the two nations hold an annual partnership dialogue and a security dialogue and have developed a cooperative relationship over the years to meet shared concerns .
in recent years , the rise of islamist militancy has been a cause of concern to the united states and to bangladesh's prime minister , sheikh hasina , and her government .
a growing population , when combined with environmental stress brought on by natural disasters and climate change , may pose further challenges for bangladesh , particularly given its already high population density .
