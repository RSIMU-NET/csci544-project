in view of this concern , you requested that we examine ( 1 ) the extent to which dod is using these waivers and why , ( 2 ) the data and analyses dod is relying on to arrive at a price , ( 3 ) factors that minimize or increase risks of inflated prices , and ( 4 ) whether dod has provided adequate guidance to minimize these risks .
for example , in fiscal year 2000 , the department of defense ( dod ) awarded contracts valued at about $36.2 billion without competition .
to maximize the value of taxpayer dollars , the federal government generally seeks to award its contracts through competition .
in these cases , contractors and subcontractors normally provide the government with cost or pricing data supporting their proposed prices and certify that the data submitted are accurate , complete , and current .
this subcommittee has been concerned about the use of waivers .
however , the government also buys unique products and services , including sophisticated weapons systems , for which it cannot always rely on competition to get the best prices and values .
this requirement , established by the truth in negotiations act , is meant to protect against inflated prices , by ensuring that the government has the data it needs to effectively negotiate with the contractor .
