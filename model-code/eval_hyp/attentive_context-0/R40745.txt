health care reform is at the top of the domestic policy agenda for the 111 th congress , driven by concerns about the growing ranks of the uninsured and the unsustainable growth in spending on health care and health insurance .
improving access to care and controlling rising costs will require changes to both the financing and delivery of health care .
in a november 2008 report outlining its goals for health reform , the national priorities partnership , representing all the major stakeholder groups in the health sector , identified four major challenges to the delivery of high - quality care .
this section would require the secretary to conduct a study addressing , among other things: ( 1 ) the projected need for primary eye and vision care , including among underserved , rural , and senior populations ; ( 2 ) the role and impact of optometrists in the early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma , cataracts , diabetes , and other conditions ; ( 3 ) whether optometrists should be recognized and supported as primary care providers ; ( 4 ) the existence and extent of barriers to the recruitment and participation of underrepresented minorities in optometry , including the potential role played by the lack of eligibility of optometrists , optometry students , and facilities for certain federal health programs ; and ( 5 ) federal support for clinical optometric education and options for enhancing that support to address barriers to underrepresented minority recruitment and participation in optometry and to improve access to primary eye and vision care , especially in underserved and rural areas .
