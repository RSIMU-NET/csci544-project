some international security agreements entered by the united states , such as those obliging parties to come to the defense of another in the event of an attack , involve substantial commitments and have traditionally been entered as treaties , ratified with the advice and consent of the senate .
the united states is a party to numerous security agreements with other nations .
other agreements dealing with more technical matters , such as military basing rights or the application of a host country's laws to u.s. forces stationed within , are entered more routinely and usually take a form other than treaty .
regardless of the form of a security arrangement , congress has several tools which enable it to exercise oversight regarding the negotiation , form , conclusion , and implementation of the agreement by the united states .
treaties and executive agreements have , in part or in whole , been found to be non - self - executing for at least three reasons: ( 1 ) implementing legislation is constitutionally required ; ( 2 ) the senate , in giving consent to a treaty , or congress , by resolution , requires implementing legislation for the agreement to be given force ; or ( 3 ) the agreement manifests an intention that it shall not become effective as domestic law without the enactment of implementing legislation .
