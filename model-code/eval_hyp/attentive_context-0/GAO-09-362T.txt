with an annual appropriation of about $512 billion in fiscal year 2009 and supplemental funding of about $807 billion over the past several years to support the global war on terrorism , dod has a larger budget than any other federal agency .
while the combat effectiveness of u.s. forces and weapon systems is unparalleled , dod has not been as effective in managing its ongoing business operations , which have adversely affected mission performance and increased the department's vulnerability to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement .
current operational demands have highlighted the impact of these persistent problems as dod has been forced to work outside of its traditional acquisition process to acquire equipment that meets warfighter needs , as was the case with the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle .
gao has made numerous recommendations over the past 10 years aimed at improving dod's management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces , including the need for ( 1 ) dod - wide guidance on how to manage contractors that support deployed forces , ( 2 ) improved training for military commanders and contract oversight personnel , and ( 3 ) a focal point within dod dedicated to leading dod's efforts to improve the management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces .
