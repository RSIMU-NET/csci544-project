my statement today addresses ( 1 ) our most recent estimates of the net financial benefit from replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin , ( 2 ) the long - standing public and private sector considerations of such a replacement , and ( 3 ) the experiences of other countries with replacing currency .
gao has reported six times over the last 22 years that replacing the $1 note with the $1 coin would result in net financial benefits to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
for our march 2011 report , to estimate the net financial benefit to the government , we constructed an economic model with data from the federal reserve , and the department of the treasury's ( treasury department ) bureau of engraving and printing and the united states mint ( mint ) .
this gain equals the difference between the face value of currency and its costs of production , which reflects a financial transfer to the federal government because it reduces the government's need to raise revenues through borrowing .
although we recognize that such a replacement would have benefits and costs for the public and for private businesses , the model was designed to estimate the net benefit and costs solely to the federal government and did not quantify the effects on the public or on private business .
