we have made many recommendations to reduce those risks ; however , blm has been slow to implement some recommendations and has not yet fully implemented others .
the almrs / modernization was intended to provide modern computer and telecommunications equipment and office automation for over 200 offices nationwide as well as software to more efficiently record , maintain , and retrieve land description , ownership , and use information to support blm , other federal programs , and interested parties .
thank you for inviting us to participate in today's hearing on the bureau of land management's ( blm ) automated land and mineral record system project , also known as the almrs / modernization .
mr. chairman , blm spent over 15 years and estimates that it invested about $411 million planning and developing the almrs / modernization , only to have the major software component — known as the almrs initial operating capability ( ioc ) — fail .
in addition , to reduce the risk that future efforts will result in similar failures , blm should assess its information technology investment practices and systems acquisition capabilities .
as you requested , i will discuss ( 1 ) the history of the project , ( 2 ) the results of our reviews , including the key reasons for problems , and ( 3 ) where we believe blm should go from here .
