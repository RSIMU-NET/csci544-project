our objectives were to assess the extent to which ( 1 ) the department of defense ( dod ) has effectively managed and overseen drrs acquisition and deployment , and ( 2 ) features of the defense readiness reporting system ( drrs ) have been implemented and are consistent with legislative requirements and dod guidance .
to assess the ability of u.s. forces to execute the wartime missions for which they were designed , as well as other assigned missions , and to make decisions about deploying forces , the department of defense ( dod ) relies heavily on readiness information derived from multiple information systems .
in addressing these issues , we assessed the extent to which ( 1 ) dod has effectively managed and overseen drrs acquisition and deployment , and ( 2 ) features of drrs have been implemented and are consistent with legislative requirements and dod guidance .
while some users are consistently reporting enhanced capability information , reporting from other users has been inconsistent .
based on the status of the program at that time and dod's past record on readiness reporting initiatives , we recommended that the secretary of defense direct the office of usd ( p&r ) to develop an implementation plan that identified performance goals that are objective , quantifiable , and measurable ; performance indicators to measure outcomes ; an evaluation plan to compare program results with established goals ; milestones to guide drrs development to the planned 2007 full capability date .
