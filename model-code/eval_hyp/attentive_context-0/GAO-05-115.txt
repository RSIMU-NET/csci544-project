the chairman of the senate committee on finance asked us to document the social security administration's ( ssa ) current processes and internal controls for issuing social security numbers ( ssn ) and replacement cards to u.s. - born children under the age of 18 and identify any weaknesses that may affect ssa's ability to ensure the integrity of the ssn and the efficiency of enumeration processes .
in light of the key role certified birth certificates play in ssa's enumeration processes and the potential for identity thieves to use fraudulent birth documents to obtain ssns , the congress should consider authorizing the development of a cost - effective nationwide system to electronically verify these documents .
because of increasing concerns regarding the enumeration of children , the chairman of the senate finance committee requested that we ( 1 ) document current processes and internal controls for issuing ssns to u.s. - born children under the age of 18 and ( 2 ) identify any weaknesses that may affect ssa's ability to ensure the integrity of the ssn and the efficiency of enumeration processes .
however , ssa has not fully incorporated some of these controls into its enumeration processes .
