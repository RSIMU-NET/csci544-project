as you requested , we reviewed the small business administration's ( sba ) fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan required by the government performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993 to assess the agency's progress in achieving selected key outcomes that you identified as important mission areas for the agency .
as agreed , using the selected key outcomes for sba as a framework , we ( 1 ) assessed the progress sba has made in achieving these outcomes and the strategies the agency has in place to achieve them , and ( 2 ) compared sba's fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan with the agency's prior year performance report and plan for these outcomes .
additionally , we agreed to analyze how sba addressed its major management challenges , including the governmentwide , high - risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security that we and sba's inspector general ( ig ) identified .
these are the same outcomes we addressed in our june 2000 review of the agency's fiscal year 1999 performance report and fiscal year 2001 performance plan to provide a baseline by which to measure the agency's performance from year to year .
