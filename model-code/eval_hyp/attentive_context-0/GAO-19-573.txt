the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has faced a number of challenges since it began operations in 2003 , one of the most prominent being managing a workforce of more than 240,000 employees .
in 2003 , we designated implementing and transforming dhs as high risk because it had to transform 22 agencies — several with major management challenges — into one department .
dhs and its components also reported that areas of their eeo programs do not have sufficient staffing to successfully implement eeo activities .
