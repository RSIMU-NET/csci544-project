to examine department of veterans affairs ( va ) purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements , we reviewed relevant va policies and from these policies we judgmentally selected two purchasing requirements , two tracking requirements , and two reprocessing requirements that we determined were relevant to veterans' safety issues that were identified at certain va medical centers ( vamc ) in 2008 and 2009 .
in this report , we examine ( 1 ) va purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements in va policies , which were selected based on their relevance to patient safety incidents , and ( 2 ) va's oversight of vamcs' compliance with these selected requirements .
in addition , va recently made changes to its oversight of vamcs' compliance with selected reprocessing requirements ; however , this oversight continues to have weaknesses .
va's oversight of vamcs' compliance with selected purchasing and reprocessing requirements has weaknesses , which result in va not being able to systematically identify and address noncompliance .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates one of the largest integrated health care delivery systems in the united states , providing care to over 5.5 million veterans annually .
