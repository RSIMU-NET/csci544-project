my testimony will focus on ( 1 ) dod's recent contracting trends , such as the spending on goods and services and the environment in which this activity takes place ; and ( 2 ) selected practices which undermine dod's ability to establish solid business arrangements , particularly those involving the selection and oversight of dod's contractors and incentivizing their performance .
with dod spending well over $250 billion annually to acquire products and services , prudence with taxpayer funds , widening deficits , and growing long - range fiscal challenges demand that dod maximize its return on investment and provide the warfighter with needed capabilities at the best value for the taxpayer .
given current policies , in the next few decades the nation will face large and growing structural deficits due to known demographic trends , rising healthcare costs and current revenue - to - expenditure gaps .
while dod has embarked on a series of efforts to reform its business operations , serious challenges and inefficiencies remain .
at the same time , weapons programs are commanding more and more resources as dod undertakes increasingly ambitious efforts to transform its ability to confront current and potential threats .
