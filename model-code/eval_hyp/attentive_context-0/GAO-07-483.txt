thus , to help mitigate future difficulties , federal policymakers , airport officials , and other stakeholders are considering the introduction of the a380 and other new classes of aircraft as they move forward with airport development throughout the nation as well as the development of the next generation air transportation system .
this report discusses ( 1 ) the safety issues associated with the introduction of the a380 , and how u.s. airports are addressing them , ( 2 ) the potential impact of a380 operations on the capacity of u.s. airports , and ( 3 ) how selected foreign airports are addressing these safety and capacity issues .
the freight version of the aircraft , the a380f , has been delayed and the first delivery is to be determined .
the freight version of the 747-8 is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2009 ; the passenger version of the 747-8 is scheduled for delivery beginning in 2010 .
by implementing these approaches , officials from the foreign airports we visited do not anticipate that the introduction of the a380 will result in delays or disruptions at their airports , despite higher levels of expected a380 traffic compared to most u.s. airports because these airports will not have to impose operating restrictions on the a380 to the extent of u.s. airports .
