issues and questions related to the killing of osama bin laden ( obl ) are multifaceted and may have operational , regional , and policy implications .
operational policy issues include congressional notification , legal considerations , and current and future military activities .
the killing of obl nearly 10 years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the united states poses many questions about the continuing destructive capabilities of aq , the effects on regional affiliates , and u.s. policy implications in pakistan and afghanistan .
in the wake of obl's death , many practitioners and observers have expressed interest in the implications for u.s. national security strategy â€” whether and to what extent the u.s. government's prioritization of ct relative to other national security imperatives , the distribution of ct efforts among u.s. government agencies , and the relative balance of emphasis between ct and other concerns within key u.s. government agencies , ought to be adjusted .
near - and long - term security and foreign policy considerations may be reassessed with the killing of obl .
as intelligence operations in the wake of the recent raid on obl's compound shed light on core aq and its affiliates' activities , policymakers may be presented with new information to help in determining how the u.s. and international counterterrorism communities might initiate changes to transnational security and foreign policy strategies .
