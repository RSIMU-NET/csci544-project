this report examines 1. the number of prvs that have been awarded , and what is known about them and about the drugs for which they were awarded ; 2. the number of prvs that have been redeemed , and what is known about them and about the drugs for which they were redeemed ; and 3. what is known about the extent to which prv programs provide incentives for drug development to meet unmet needs .
in addition to suggesting improvements to the prv programs , drug sponsors , researchers , and stakeholders we contacted , as well as our literature review , identified potential alternatives to the prv programs that provide incentives for drug development ( see table 2 ) .
we conducted these interviews to obtain information on ( 1 ) prv awards and sales and insights into the characteristics of awarded prvs and trends in prv sales ; ( 2 ) redemption data , reasons why a drug sponsor might redeem a prv , and the effect the prv redemptions have had on fda resources ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the extent to which prv programs provide incentives for drug development to meet unmet needs .
