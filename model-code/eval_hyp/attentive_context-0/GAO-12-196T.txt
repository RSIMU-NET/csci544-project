my statement today focuses on initial observations from our ongoing review and examines ( 1 ) the trends in the rate of children receiving ssi benefits due to mental impairments over the past decade ; ( 2 ) the role that medical and nonmedical information , such as medication and school records , play in the initial determination of a child's medical eligibility ; and ( 3 ) the steps ssa has taken to monitor the continued medical eligibility of these children .
administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) , ssi is a nationwide federal assistance program that provides cash benefits to eligible low - income disabled individuals , including children , as well as certain individuals who are aged or blind .
in 2010 , ssa paid almost 8 million recipients about $50 billion in ssi benefits , of which more than $9 billion was paid to about 1.2 million disabled children .
our prior work has shown that accurately diagnosing some types of mental impairments is a complex and often subjective process for ssa , which can sometimes be vulnerable to fraud and abuse .
our work included site visits to 9 field offices within these regions , as well as 11 state disability determination services ( dds ) offices ( state agencies under the direction of ssa that perform medical eligibility determinations and continuing disability reviews of ssi applicants ) .
