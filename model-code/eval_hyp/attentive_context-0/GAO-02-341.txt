as agreed , our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) examine the judiciary's courtroom sharing policies for senior judges , ( 2 ) obtain information about the extent to which senior judges are currently sharing courtrooms and their experiences with courtroom sharing , and ( 3 ) determine the judiciary's efforts to explore the potential for senior judges to share courtrooms in future courthouse construction projects .
over the last few years , various members of congress and the administration have become increasingly concerned that district judge trial courtrooms may be underutilized and that more courtrooms than needed have been , and continue to be , constructed .
on march 5 , 2002 , we received written comments on a draft of this report from the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aoc ) â€” the judiciary's administrative arm .
this report responds to your request for information on the judiciary's efforts to have district judges share courtrooms , especially district judges with senior status , also known as senior judges .
the judiciary continues to believe that it should retain its one - judge , one - courtroom policy for active district judges because of the potential negative effects courtroom sharing may have on effective judicial administration .
