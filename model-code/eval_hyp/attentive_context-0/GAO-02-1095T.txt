within the federal government , the food and drug administration ( fda ) is responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's blood supply .
the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , reminded the nation of the critical importance of a safe and adequate supply of blood for transfusions .
in recent years , an average of about 8 million volunteers have donated more than 14 million units of blood annually , and approximately 4.5 million patients per year have received life - saving blood transfusions , according to the american association of blood banks ( aabb ) .
although local and temporary blood shortages occur from time to time , the inventory of blood in america's hospitals was at historically high levels before september 11 and has generally remained adequate through the first 8 months of 2002 .
about 90 percent of the u.s. blood supply is collected by two blood suppliers , the american national red cross and independent blood banks affiliated with america's blood centers ( abc ) .
our report also describes recent changes in the price of blood and evaluates the potential impact of the new guidance from fda that is aimed at reducing the risk of transmitting variant creutzfeldt - jakob disease , the human form of “mad cow” disease , through blood transfusions .
