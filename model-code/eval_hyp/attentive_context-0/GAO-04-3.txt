to more fully examine the issues raised by the allegations about unlawful tying and underpricing of corporate credit , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) what evidence , if any , suggests that commercial banks with investment affiliates engage in unlawful tying ; ( 2 ) what steps the federal banking regulators have taken to examine for unlawful tying and the results of these efforts ; ( 3 ) what evidence , if any , suggests that commercial banks with investment affiliates unlawfully discount the price of corporate credit to obtain underwriting business for their investment affiliates ; and ( 4 ) what , if any , competitive advantages accounting rules , capital standards , and access to the federal safety net create for commercial banks over investment banks .
in the 70 years since the passage of the glass - steagall act of 1933 , which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities such as securities underwriting , changes in legislation and regulatory interpretations have relaxed some of the restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that served to distance commercial banks from investment banking .
as a result of these and other developments , commercial banks and their investment bank affiliates ( investment affiliates ) can provide complementary financial products and services .
