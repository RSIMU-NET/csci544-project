specifically , we ( 1 ) identified federal funding for unclassified programs and activities to combat terrorism ; ( 2 ) determined whether any agency or entity has been designated to coordinate budget proposals , establish priorities , manage funding requirements , and help ensure the efficient allocation of federal resources for combating terrorism across federal agencies ; ( 3 ) explored opportunities for agencies to expand coordination of terrorism - related programs and activities under the government performance and results act principles and framework ; and ( 4 ) assessed issues concerning the reimbursement of support provided to agencies with lead counterterrorism responsibilities .
among its general mission responsibilities , the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to evaluate the effectiveness of agency programs , policies , and procedures ; assess competing funding demands among agencies ; set funding priorities ; and develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms .
because data on agencies' spending for u.s. efforts to combat terrorism are not available from a central source , we obtained from the departments of defense ; energy ; justice , including the fbi ; state ; transportation ( faa ) ; treasury ; and health and human services data on spending that the agencies categorized as related to their unclassified efforts to combat terrorism .
