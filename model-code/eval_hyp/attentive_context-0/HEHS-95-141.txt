cancer takes almost 500,000 lives annually and is the second leading cause of death in the united states .
about 400,000 of the 1 million americans who will develop cancer this year , however , will be cured .
despite advances in treating cancer , some forms of cancer are often resistant to current therapies and have a very poor outcome .
based on the findings of an earlier study that suggested the drug hydrazine sulfate may improve survival for some patients with advanced cancer , the national cancer institute ( nci ) sponsored three studies of hydrazine sulfate .
 .
it also discusses how nci and the trials' investigators dealt with the issue of potential incompatibility with certain agents , the extent to which patients may have received these agents , and how this issue was reported .
all three nci - sponsored studies , however , failed to demonstrate any benefit from hydrazine sulfate .
in addition , nci should have ensured that calgb investigators prospectively collected data on concurrent medications and alcohol use on research forms to permit investigators to analyze trial data to determine the possible effects of these agents on patients taking hydrazine sulfate .
