two taxpayer - supported revenue sources are available to conventions: ( 1 ) presidential public campaign funds ; and ( 2 ) security funds .
additionally , congress appropriates federal funding for the securing of the convention venues .
as federal , state , and local governments further refine their homeland security activities generally , and specifically convention security operations , congress may consider different options for how the federal government provides funding for state and local costs incurred in securing convention venues .
the role of the federal government in funding convention security is a fairly new development since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
a variety of policy issues surrounds convention financing .
the 2012 democratic and republican conventions received a total of approximately $36.5 million from the presidential election campaign fund ( which generally excludes security costs ) .
although pecf funding of convention operations has been in place since the 1976 election cycle , the role of federal convention funding remains subject to debate in congress and beyond .
these divergent views on the use of public funds to support party conventions also appear in other contexts in the debate surrounding campaign finance policy .
