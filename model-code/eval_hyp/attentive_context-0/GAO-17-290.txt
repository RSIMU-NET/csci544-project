for any future probe and educate reviews , cms should establish performance metrics that will help the agency determine the reviews' effectiveness in reducing improper billing .
in fiscal year 2016 , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) reported that an estimated 11 percent of the payments made to health care providers under the medicare fee - for - service program were made improperly , representing $41.1 billion in improper payments .
improper payments include payments made in error , such as payments that should not have been made ; payments made in incorrect amounts , including overpayments and underpayments ; and payments for claims that were not properly documented .
to date , cms has required macs to conduct two probe and educate reviews: a review of short - stay hospital claims , which has been completed , and a review of home health claims , which is ongoing .
we found that the effectiveness of the macs' short - stay hospital probe and educate reviews cannot be confirmed because cms did not establish performance metrics to determine whether the probe and educate reviews were effective in reducing improper billing .
