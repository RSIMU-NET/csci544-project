the existence , possible scope and importance of the common law experimental use privilegein patent law remains the subject of considerable debate .
however , it should be noted that the patentact of 1952 includes a limited statutory experimental use privilege for patents on pharmaceuticals,medical devices , and certain other products regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
in addition , congress has enacted otherintellectual property legislation that incorporates provisions shielding researchers from infringementliability .
this provision , enacted as part of 1984 legislation known as the hatch - waxman act , ( 91 ) applies to firms seekingto market generic equivalents of brand - name products .
this report considers these topics in turn .
article 31 , which is among the more detailed provisions in the trips agreement , in partrequires that each application for a compulsory license be considered on its individual merits ; thatthe proposed user must have made efforts to obtain a license from the patent owner ; and that thelegal validity of such a license be subject to review by the courts or other independent authority .
if reform of the experimental use privilege is deemed prudent , however , another possibilityis the introduction of some additional form of the experimental use privilege into the patent act of1952 .
