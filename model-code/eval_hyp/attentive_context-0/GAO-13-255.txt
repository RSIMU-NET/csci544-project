our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the topics the agricultural research agency ( ars ) and the national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) focus on and the safeguards they use to prevent duplication of research projects , along with any shortcomings in those safeguards , and ( 2 ) collaborative planning ars and nifa engaged in and how , if at all , such planning could be enhanced .
enhance ars's and nifa's collaborative approach across all topic areas they have in common — including holding jointly sponsored meetings with stakeholders — to help set their research priorities and help them determine their roles and responsibilities for carrying out these priorities .
among the practices we identified were ( 1 ) defining and articulating a common outcome ; ( 2 ) defining and agreeing on roles and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies ; ( 4 ) identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources ; and ( 5 ) establishing compatible policies , procedures , and other means to operate across agency boundaries .
require , as usda identifies promising systems for searching and disseminating research project information , the appropriate entity to ( 1 ) determine whether vivo or other systems are more effective or efficient than cris in identifying potentially duplicative research and ( 2 ) revise guidance to reflect the best system and methods for identifying potentially duplicative research projects .
