this report ( 1 ) describes the office of personnel management's ( opm ) actions to respond to the requirements of the telework enhancement act of 2010 and ( 2 ) assesses how opm is handling and addressing identified data reliability issues in the 2011 telework data call .
the office of personnel management ( opm ) has reported telework can enhance the productivity and flexibility of federal employees ; help recruit and retain a qualified workforce ; and reduce real estate , overhead , energy , and environmental costs .
to improve opm's annual reporting of telework to congress , we recommend that the opm director take the following two actions: ensure that the reliability limitations related to the 2011 telework data call are clearly reported in its june 2012 report to congress by fully describing how existing measures of telework participation vary widely in validity and reliability and limit the capability of opm to reliably report the actual level and frequency of telework participation .
continue efforts to improve data collection and gather information that allows for the appropriate qualification of year - to - year comparisons and informs users about the effects of data collection changes going forward .
