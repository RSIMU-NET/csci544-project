the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , significantly altered the nation's views on how to secure and protect the people , borders , and assets of the united states , and dramatically highlighted the need to take immediate actions to reduce the likelihood of future attacks of this magnitude taking place on u.s. soil .
with the benefit of hindsight , it is apparent that on 9 / 11 , several areas in particular — the u.s. commercial aviation system , the federal government's approach to compiling and managing terrorist watch lists , the nonimmigrant visa process , and mechanisms for screening and recording foreign travelers entering and exiting the united states — were all shown to be vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists intent on gaining entry to the country and wreaking havoc .
dhs agreed with these recommendations .
 ( we made no recommendations related to funding challenges. ) .
as the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( the 9 / 11 commission ) noted in its 2004 report , none of the security measures adopted by the u.s. government prior to the attacks disturbed or even delayed the progress of the al qaeda plot .
