to do so , we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which findings from baseline assessments and other information inform us about the need to reassess gas transmission pipelines for safety risks at least every 7 years and ( 2 ) the ability of operators to obtain the services and tools needed to perform the reassessments .
gas transmission pipelines are one of the nation's safest modes of freight transportation: nationwide about three people have died and about eight have been injured annually , on average , over the past decade because of natural gas pipeline incidents from all causes .
however , nationwide , these incidents are relatively rare .
to enhance the safety of gas transmission pipelines , the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 requires that operators of these pipelines develop programs to assess and mitigate safety threats , such as leaks or ruptures due to incorrect operation or corrosion , to pipeline segments that are located in highly populated and frequently used areas , such as parks .
under flexibility provided by the act , the federal regulator — the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration ( phmsa ) — requires that operators reassess these pipeline segments for corrosion damage at least every 7 years in its implementing regulations , because corrosion is the most frequent cause of failures that can occur over time .
