this letter responds to your request of january 6 , 1998 , and in subsequent discussions , that we assist the subcommittee by ( 1 ) determining which entities or companies engage in telephone slamming violations â€” the unauthorized switching of a customer from one long - distance provider to another ; ( 2 ) determining the process by which the providers defraud consumers ; and ( 3 ) reviewing what the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , state regulatory entities , and the telecommunications industry have done to curtail slamming .
telephone customers who are victims of intentional slamming can be harmed in a number of ways ranging from having to pay higher , sometimes exorbitant , long - distance rates to being unable to use the calling cards of their provider of choice .
but according to the fcc , slamming is a growing problem: the complaints received by the fcc have grown from under 2,000 in 1993 to over 20,000 in 1997 .
further , one local telephone exchange company ( another general recipient of slamming complaints ) reported receiving over 80,000 complaints in the first 9 months of 1997 alone .
determining the prevalence of telephone slamming is very difficult because no central repository for slamming complaints exists .
