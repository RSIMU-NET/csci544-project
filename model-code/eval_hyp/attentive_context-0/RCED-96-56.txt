the department of energy ( doe ) has about 55 million gallons of highly radioactive waste currently stored in 177 underground tanks at its hanford site in washington state .
this cleanup effort is also one of doe's most expensive projects ; its estimated life - cycle cost is $36 billion .
because of characterization's importance to the cleanup and safe storage of the wastes , our objectives were to ( 1 ) review doe's progress in meeting the deadlines , ( 2 ) identify any impediments to making progress , and ( 3 ) determine what impact continued delays could have .
doe's program for developing a safe , permanent way to dispose of the waste in these tanks is one of its highest priorities .
to ensure that funds for the overall tank waste remediation program are spent as wisely as possible , we recommend that the secretary of energy defer funding the construction of pretreatment and treatment facilities until ( 1 ) the technical adequacy of the characterization program has been confirmed or established and ( 2 ) sufficient waste characterization information is available to reliably define the requirements of those facilities .
