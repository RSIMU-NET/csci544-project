the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) is an agency within the department of defense with both military and civil works responsibilities .
instead , usace is directly engaged in the planning and construction of projects ; the majority of its appropriations are used performing work on specific studies and contracting for construction of projects authorized by congress .
part of the issue is how effective , efficient , and equitable is the usace project delivery process in meeting the nation's needs .
congress directs and oversees the specific navigation , flood control , and ecosystem restoration projects that usace plans and constructs through authorization legislation , annual and supplemental appropriations legislation , and oversight efforts .
more recently , congress has authorized the agency to restore aquatic ecosystems .
it began with improving and regulating navigation channels thereby facilitating the movement of goods between states and for import and export .
broadly , congress is faced with considering how well the nation is addressing its water resource needs and what is the current and future role of usace in addressing those needs .
usace operates more than 700 dams ; has built 14,500 miles of levees ; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal , great lakes , and inland harbors , as well as 12,000 miles of inland waterways .
