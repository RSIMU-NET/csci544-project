our report objectives were to examine ( 1 ) how the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) plans to meet future demand for electricity and how tva's resource planning and forecasts compare to plans and forecasts from other sources , ( 2 ) tva's efforts to use energy efficiency to meet demand for electricity , and ( 3 ) tva's financial condition and how it affects tva's ability to meet its operational and financial goals .
we evaluated tva's assumptions and variables for some of the underlying determinants of its power supply plan , such as capital costs of electricity generation alternatives , fuel costs , emissions - related costs , and costs of energy efficiency programs .
several factors constrain tva's energy efficiency efforts .
