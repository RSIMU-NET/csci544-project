social media have arguably enhanced the ability of members of congress to fulfill their representational duties by providing greater opportunities for communications between members and constituents , supporting the fundamental democratic role of sharing information about public policy and government operations .
as members of congress adopt new online social networking services , more information is potentially available faster than ever before .
some platforms appear to be gaining in popularity among members of congress ( e.g. , instagram , which has grown from approximately 25% of members with accounts in 2015 to more than 50% in 2017 ) , whereas others were briefly popular but have now faded from public relevance ( e.g. , in june 2014 , 26% of members had a vine account ; today the service has been shut down and no members of congress have accounts ) .
since that time , members of congress have primarily adopted three social media platforms — twitter , facebook , and youtube — to share information and potentially to collect opinions on a range of policy issues .
despite this , some have raised concerns about electronic communications .
as various social media platforms expand and diminish in popularity , members of congress continue to explore new platforms to enhance their communications strategies .
