 ( recommendation 1 ) .
the southwest border of the united states has long been vulnerable to cross - border illegal activity .
within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) u.s. border patrol ( border patrol ) is the federal agency responsible for securing the national borders between u.s. ports of entry .
border patrol has taken some steps toward tracking the performance of its surveillance technologies , including requiring agents to record when technologies assist in an apprehension or seizure .
however , additional guidance to better ensure the quality of these data ( including agent training and managerial review ) , would help border patrol determine the mission benefits of its surveillance technologies , which in turn could be used to inform border patrol's resource allocation decisions .
the chief of the border patrol should issue guidance for sectors to improve the quality and usability of its surveillance technology asset assist information to help ensure it has reliable data so that border patrol can be better positioned to measure the impact of these technologies on its border security efforts and inform future investments .
in november 2011 , we found that cbp did not have the information needed to fully support and implement the atp and recommended that cbp ( 1 ) determine the mission benefits to be derived from implementation of the atp and ( 2 ) develop and apply key attributes for metrics to assess program implementation .
