as agreed with the subcommittee , we evaluated the current system of controls for such mailings to assess whether those controls reasonably ensure that mailer - claimed discounts are granted only when earned .
the postal service recognizes the need to have reasonable assurance that its bulk business mail operation adequately protects the service from postage revenue losses .
that assurance is dependent on the control system operating as designed , including the production of certain information that management determined was needed for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the control system and making changes as appropriate .
this cost is in the form of higher processing expenses because the postal service must then do work it has already , in effect , paid mailers to do through discounted postage rates .
to guard against accepting improperly prepared mailings , postal service bulk mail acceptance clerks are supposed to verify the accuracy of bulk business mailings .
this report responds to your request that we review the postal service's controls over postage paid on presorted / barcoded mailings submitted by business customers .
as described in the postal service's manuals , the control system requires that presort and barcode mail verifications , including supervisory reviews , be done and documented ; mailings resubmitted following a failed verification be reverified to ensure that the errors are corrected ; and the results of verifications , including supervisory reviews , be regularly reported to specific management levels , including postal service headquarters .
