such trends have been of interest to congress because they provide information about how the labor force is evolving , the resilience or sensitivity of some jobs to recession , and the changing needs of employers , and thereby inform workforce planning , income support programs , and other potential policy responses .
recessions , for example , bring about increased joblessness with stronger impacts for certain worker groups , and changes in production patterns and consumers' preferences for goods and services — examples of structural forces — further influence the size and composition of employment .
labor markets are highly responsive to short - and long - term economic influences .
for example , total employment , the types of jobs available , their locations , and the skills sought by employers respond in various degrees to changing cyclical and structural forces .
since 2007 , the labor market has been affected by factors such as the great recession of 2007-2009 , technological innovation , and an aging labor force that have altered the mix of jobs available to u.s. workers .
using data from the bureau of labor statistics , this report considers how such changes have affected the u.s. labor market since 2007 , examining the performance of labor market indicators like employment , unemployment , and labor force participation ; changes in the types of jobs available by industry and occupation ; and employment outcomes for different demographic groups .
