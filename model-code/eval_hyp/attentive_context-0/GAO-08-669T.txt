specifically , i will address ( 1 ) the cost of the army's plans to implement these initiatives , and ( 2 ) the management challenges facing the army and the actions needed to improve its implementation of these initiatives .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to army equipment in light of the high pace and long duration of operations in iraq and afghanistan as well as the army's plans to modernize and transform its capabilities .
concerned about declining military readiness , congress has provided substantial funding in response to department of defense ( dod ) funding requests .
as you requested , my testimony will focus on the equipping implications of restructuring and expanding the army ; efforts to repair , replace , and recapitalize equipment through the army's reset program ; and reconstitution of prepositioned equipment .
the army has undertaken a number of initiatives to restructure and rebuild its force in the midst of ongoing overseas operations .
key initiatives include plans to restructure the army from divisions to standardized modular brigades as well as expand the force by more than 74,000 soldiers .
amid ongoing operations , the army must also reset ( repair or replace ) existing equipment that has been used in harsh environments overseas .
