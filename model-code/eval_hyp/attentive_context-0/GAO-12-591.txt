the department of energy's ( doe ) isotope development and production for research and applications program ( isotope program ) is the only domestic supplier for many of the more than 300 different isotopes that it sells , many of which are critical to medical , commercial , research , and national security applications .
specifically , our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) which isotopes are produced , sold , or distributed either by the isotope program or nnsa and how the two entities make isotopes available for commercial and research applications ; ( 2 ) what steps the isotope program takes to provide isotopes for commercial and research applications ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which doe is assessing and mitigating risks facing the isotope program .
establish clear guidance for managing the revolving fund to ensure that the fund is sufficient to use as a contingency for unexpected losses in revenue .
the isotope program is taking some actions to assess risks to achieving its mission , including identifying high - priority isotopes and using its revolving fund to mitigate risks from unforeseen events .
the isotope program has begun taking some actions to identify and mitigate risks to achieving its mission of producing isotopes , such as the risk of relying on sales of a small number of commercial isotopes for a large percentage of its revenues , but without first establishing clear , consistent program objectives , the program's risk assessment efforts are not comprehensive .
