in the first of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2020 ( see box "ers's annual farm income forecasts" below ) , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) economic research service ( ers ) projects that u.s. net farm income will rise 3.3% year - over - year in 2020 to $96.7 billion , up $3.1 billion from last year ( figure 1 and table a - 1 ) .
the projected rise in asset value is due to increases in both real estate values ( +1.5% ) and non - real - estate values ( +0.6% ) .
thus , the well - being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments , jobs , and other links to the nonfarm economy .
the february forecast of $96.7 billion is 6.3% above the 10-year average of $89.9 billion ( in nominal dollars ) but is well below 2013's record high of $123.7 billion .
the divergence in year - to - year changes between the two measures of net income is due to their different treatment of harvested crops .
