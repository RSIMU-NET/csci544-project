the automatic annual adjustment for members of congress is determined by a formula using a component of the employment cost index ( eci ) , which measures rate of change in private sector pay .
the adjustment automatically takes effect unless ( 1 ) congress statutorily prohibits the adjustment ; ( 2 ) congress statutorily revises the adjustment ; or ( 3 ) the annual base pay adjustment of general schedule ( gs ) federal employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled increase for members , in which case the percentage adjustment for member pay is automatically lowered to match the percentage adjustment in gs base pay .
