our objectives for this report were to examine labor's process for making scsep grant awards ; the extent to which labor's allocation of scsep funds equitably distributes the subsidized job positions ; and other administrative issues , including administrative expenses , for the program .
for program year 1994 , each of delaware's three counties had an equitable distribution of positions ; each of hawaii's five counties had an equitable number of positions ; and alaska's six geographic areas used for the program had close to equitable numbers .
to do this , the secretary should ( 1 ) require greater cooperation among national sponsors and states in equitable distribution matters and ( 2 ) adjust , as necessary , sponsors' funding levels to reward sponsors that are willing to establish positions in underserved counties .
