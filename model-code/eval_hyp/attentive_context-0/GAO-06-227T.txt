i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide our observations on the department of defense's ( dod ) final national security personnel system ( nsps ) regulations , which the secretary of defense and the director of the office of personnel management ( opm ) published earlier this month .
nsps will not only affect the roughly 700,000 dod civilian employees , but it could have far - reaching implications for civil service reform across the federal government .
the final nsps regulations , if implemented properly , could go a long way in the area of helping to shape such a framework and serve , along with gao's , the department of homeland security's , and other reform efforts , as a potential model for governmentwide reform in the area of human capital management .
human capital reforms to date recognize that the “one - size - fits - all” approach is not appropriate to all agencies' demands , challenges , and missions .
as i have previously testified , we support moving forward with appropriate human capital reform , but how it is done , when it is done , and the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are successful .
