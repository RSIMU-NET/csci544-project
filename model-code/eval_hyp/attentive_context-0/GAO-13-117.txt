to help improve dot's ability to effectively address workforce needs , we recommend that the secretary of transportation take the following five actions: direct the senior procurement executive to define data the department needs to meet ofpp and dot workforce planning and oversight requirements ; provide standards for internal controls or other guidance to ensure the oas collect , report , and maintain consistent and reliable data for workforce planning and in faitas ; establish specific responsibilities for the office of the senior procurement executive and the oas to maintain workforce data , develop strategies and metrics , and monitor progress toward addressing workforce gaps and certification deficiencies ; assess whether the office of the senior procurement executive has sufficient resources to effectively oversee the acquisition workforce ; and direct the senior procurement executive and chief human capital officer to establish a coordinated process for future acquisition workforce planning .
however , dot's inspector general reported that the department has not made sufficient progress in implementing strategies and goals to increase the capability of the acquisition workforce and found that gaps in acquisition workforce hiring and development have contributed to poor contract administration and substantial cost overruns on critical programs , such as those related in response to a senate report mandate , we assessed: ( 1 ) the efforts of the office of the secretary of transportation and dot's operating administrations ( oa ) to identify acquisition workforce needs , and ( 2 ) the office of the secretary's role in providing oversight and support for acquisition workforce planning and management .
