the 115 th congress continues to take an interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .
some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the current federal deficit and debt .
the report concludes with discussion and analysis of the r&d budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that , collectively , account for nearly 99% of total federal r&d funding .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites , shale gas extraction , and defenses against disease .
its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense , health , safety , the environment , and energy security ; advancing knowledge generally ; developing the scientific and engineering workforce ; and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .
budget caps may have limited overall r&d funding and may have required movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities .
