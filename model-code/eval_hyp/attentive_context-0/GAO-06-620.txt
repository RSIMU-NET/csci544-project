this program includes assessing risk ; developing and implementing policies , procedures , and security plans ; promoting security awareness and providing specialized training for those with significant security responsibilities ; testing and evaluating the effectiveness of controls ; planning , implementing , evaluating , and documenting remedial actions to address information security deficiencies ; detecting , reporting , and responding to security incidents ; and ensuring the continuity of operations .
these problems included the ( 1 ) lack of consistent implementation of documented policies and procedures related to information security , ( 2 ) absence of integration of nonmajor applications into general support security plans , ( 3 ) lack of specialized security training for trusted employees , ( 4 ) an oversight process that allowed weaknesses to remain open even though they were reported as closed , ( 4 ) lack of updated business impact analyses and contingency plans , ( 5 ) failure to test the new financial environment in a production environment , and ( 6 ) significant access controls vulnerabilities described in a separate report .
a primary reason for these weaknesses is that fdic has not yet fully implemented its information security program .
