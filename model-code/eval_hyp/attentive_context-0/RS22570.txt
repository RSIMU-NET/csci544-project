under president obama , secretary gates issued the quadrennial defense review ( qdr ) in february 2010 , in which the united states noted the importance of implementing the u.s. - japan realignment roadmap of 2006 that will ensure the deployment of u.s. forces in japan and transform guam into a regional security hub .
guam has two important u.s. military bases: apra naval base and andersen air force base .
guam is the westernmost u.s. territory long valued as strategically significant to u.s. forward deployments in the western pacific .
as the defense department faced increased tension on the korean peninsula , the pacific command ( pacom ) based in honolulu began in 2000 to build up air and naval forces on guam to boost u.s. deterrence and power projection in asia .
in the pacific ocean , hawaii is about 2,400 miles west of california , and guam is about 3,800 miles further west of hawaii .
the defense buildup on guam has been moderate .
historically , the united states acquired guam from spain in 1898 after the spanish - american war .
the qdr also announced the development of a new joint air - sea battle concept , to integrate the air , sea , land , space , and cyberspace forces of the air force and navy to counter challenges to u.s. freedom of action , defeat adversaries with sophisticated anti - access and area - denial ( a2 / ad ) capabilities , and improve power projection operations .
