the accompanying report is one in a series of reports responding to your request that we review the information technology management processes that the federal aviation administration ( faa ) uses to manage its air traffic control modernization .
this report discusses our assessment of the department's capabilities to develop and acquire software and systems , as well as actions faa has under way to improve these capabilities .
our objectives were ( 1 ) to evaluate faa's capabilities for developing and acquiring software and systems on its atc modernization program and ( 2 ) to assess the actions faa has under way to improve these capabilities .
faa has implemented most of our recommendations .
our work since the mid - 1990s has pinpointed root causes of the modernization program's problems , including ( 1 ) immature software acquisition capabilities , ( 2 ) lack of a complete and enforced system architecture , ( 3 ) inadequate cost estimating and cost accounting practices , ( 4 ) an ineffective investment management process , and ( 5 ) an organizational culture that impaired the acquisition process .
faa's process improvement initiative has matured in recent years , but more can be done to institutionalize improvement efforts .
