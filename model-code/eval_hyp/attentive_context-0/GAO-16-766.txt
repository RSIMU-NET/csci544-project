fema's study identified areas for further consideration , including several related to charging premium rates that fully reflect risks ; responsibility for bearing and sharing risk ; responsibility for writing policies and loss adjustments ; underwriting , pricing , and allocation of premium costs ; and pricing expertise , including valuation of mitigation measures .
in 2007 , we identified four broad policy goals for federal involvement in natural catastrophe insurance: ( 1 ) charging premium rates that fully reflect actual risks ; ( 2 ) encouraging private markets to provide natural catastrophe insurance ; ( 3 ) encouraging broad participation in natural catastrophe insurance programs ; and ( 4 ) limiting costs to taxpayers before and after a disaster .
the study also reports that challenges could include lack of community interest ; limited implementation capability ; likely need to create many approaches given variation in population size , geography , and authority to regulate land use and collect revenue ; and political obstacles .
these included the prepublication and final versions of the nas study , the fema report that included the study , the study's statement of objectives and project management plan , and previous fema documents related to cbfi .
