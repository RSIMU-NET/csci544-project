as india's economy continues to grow , its energy needs , including for natural gas , will likely grow as well .
the united states has expanded technical assistance programs in order to help india meet its carbon emission reduction goals .
in 2015 india accounted for 5.3% of global primary energy consumption , while china was the largest consumer with 22.9% .
the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) believes india will remain the fastest - growing g20 economy in 2017-2018 , with an annual projected growth rate of 7.5% .
its population is expected to surpass china as the world's largest by 2022 , reaching approximately 1.4 billion people , creating greater demand for energy .
with an eye on increasing this percentage , india is instituting a number of policy initiatives like the hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy ( help ) and major infrastructure investments such as expanding domestic gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas ( lng ) import terminals .
those issues include the following: prospects for u.s. natural gas exports ; prospects for u.s. energy companies' investments in india ; indian investment in the u.s. energy sector ; india's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change ; india's ability to reduce its chronic air pollution problems , especially in new delhi , where recently smog has reached 16 times levels deemed safe ; and india's political and economic relationships with regions such as the middle east , a major supplier of lng , and central asia , a potential supplier of natural gas via pipelines .
