the army and the air force are jointly developing the joint surveillance target attack radar system ( joint stars ) .
because of the cost and importance of the joint stars effort and concerns about the gsms' performance in prior tests , we reviewed the army's test and acquisition plans for the common ground station ( cgs ) , the next gsm version .
in light of dod's unwillingness to have the army revise its acquisition strategy for the cgs , congress may wish to take the actions necessary to limit the number of cgs systems to be procured under lrip prior to the cgs successfully completing operational testing .
we are addressing this report to the committees of jurisdiction because it identifies problems and calls for corrective action that the department of defense ( dod ) has indicated an unwillingness to take .
 .
the army's commitment to its currently planned second year lrip buy of 16 cgs systems prior to the completion of the cgs ot&e would raise not only the program's risk but also its cost .
 .
the army is responsible for the development , test , production , and fielding of joint stars ground station modules ( gsm ) .
