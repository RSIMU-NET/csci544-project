a major aim of the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) is to minimize the burden that these collections impose on the public , while maximizing their public benefit .
americans spend billions of hours each year providing information to federal agencies by filling out information collections ( forms , surveys , or questionnaires ) .
the estimated total burden was 7.971 billion hours â€” a decrease of 1.6 percent ( 128 million burden hours ) from the previous year's total of about 8.099 billion hours .
for example , adjustments to the estimates ( from such factors as changes in estimation methods and estimated number of respondents ) accounted for a decrease of about 156 million hours ( 1.9 percent ) , and agency burden reduction efforts led to a decrease of about 97 million hours ( 1.2 percent ) .
under the act , the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to approve all such collections and to report annually on the agencies' estimates of the associated burden .
for its testimony , gao was asked to comment on omb's burden report for 2004 and to discuss its recent study of pra implementation ( gao - 05-424 ) , concentrating on cio review and certification processes and describing alternative processes that two agencies have used to minimize burden .
