the bureau of land management ( blm ) , within the department of the interior , and the forest service , within the u.s. department of agriculture , manage 12.5 million acres of timberland in the states of washington and oregon .
specifically , this report identifies ( 1 ) the major differences among the timber programs of the forest service's pacific northwest region , the bureau of land management , and the states of washington and oregon and ( 2 ) the effect of these differences on the agencies' planning processes .
as part of an ongoing effort to reduce federal spending , you asked us to compare the timber sale programs of the two federal agencies with those of the states .
however , the costs of federal timber sale programs have not decreased proportionately , and recent studies and testimony before congressional committees have suggested that some states operate their timber sale programs at less cost than the federal agencies .
in recent years , the volumes of timber sold and harvested from these federal timberlands have decreased because of the increased efforts to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species and to achieve a better balance of multiple resource uses .
