the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and its components invest billions of dollars each year to acquire information technology ( it ) and other capabilities to support the department's critical functions .
dhs has demonstrated significant progress in implementing leading agile practices .
however , dhs has not fully implemented these plans and has experienced challenges in measuring progress against its intended goals .
dhs concurred with the recommendations but has not yet implemented them .
dhs has partially adopted practices at all three organizational levels .
as part of an effort to improve its it acquisition and management , in april 2016 , the department identified agile software development as its preferred approach for all dhs it programs and projects .
however , as we have previously reported , many of the department's major it acquisition programs have taken longer than expected to develop and implement , or have failed to deliver the desired value to mission operations .
 ( recommendation 10 ) .
the three case study projects we selected were the 1 ) u.s. coast guard ( uscg ) command , control , communications , and computers , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) program new asset acquisition offshore patrol cutter project , with particular attention to the seawatch portion of this project ; 2 ) the u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) biometric entry exit ( bee ) program air exit project , with particular attention to the traveler verification services portion of this project ; and 3 ) the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) student and exchange visitor information system ( sevis ) program 8001 project , with particular attention to the sevis modernization portion of this effort .
