broadband — also referred to as high - speed internet service — has been deployed in the united states since the late 1990s , primarily by private sector providers .
with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) moving to define the minimum speed of broadband at 25 mbps , more communities may perceive a lack of adequate broadband service , especially those communities in rural areas .
while broadband deployment has been rapid and robust overall , there are parts of the nation where broadband is less deployed ( primarily rural areas ) and there remain regions and communities that are dissatisfied with the level of broadband service currently offered by private sector providers .
the council's objectives were to engage with industry and other stakeholders to understand ways the government can better support the needs of communities seeking to expand broadband access and adoption ; identify regulatory barriers unduly impeding broadband deployment , adoption , or competition ; survey and report back on existing programs that currently support or could be modified to support broadband competition , deployment , or adoption ; and take all necessary actions to remove these barriers and realign existing programs to increase broadband competition , deployment , and adoption .
