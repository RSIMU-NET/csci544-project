tens of thousands of chemicals are currently in commercial use in the united states and , on average , over 700 new chemicals are introduced into commerce each year .
my testimony today , which is based on our june 2005 report , chemical regulation: options exist to improve epa's ability to assess health risks and manage its chemical review program , describes epa's efforts to ( 1 ) assess existing chemicals used in commerce , ( 2 ) control the risks of new chemicals not yet in commerce , and ( 3 ) publicly disclose information provided by chemical companies under tsca .
i am pleased to appear today before the senate committee on environment and public works , to discuss our work on the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) implementation of the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) .
although these chemicals are an integral component in the production of important goods and services , some may be toxic and may adversely affect human health and / or the environment .
recognizing the need for additional information on existing chemicals , in the late 1990s epa implemented its high production volume ( hpv ) challenge program , under which chemical companies have begun to voluntarily provide test data on about 2,800 chemicals produced or imported in amounts of 1 million pounds or more a year .
