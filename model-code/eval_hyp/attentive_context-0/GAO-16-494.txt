specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe agencies' processes for determining the cio risk ratings for major it investments and ( 2 ) assess the risk of federal it investments and analyze any differences with the investments' cio risk ratings .
although there have been numerous initiatives undertaken to better manage the more than $80 billion that is annually invested in information technology ( it ) , federal it investments have too frequently failed or incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission - related outcomes .
launched in june 2009 , the dashboard is intended to provide transparency for these investments in order to facilitate public monitoring of government operations and accountability for investment performance by the federal chief information officers ( cio ) who oversee them .
to better ensure that the dashboard ratings more accurately reflect risk , we recommend that: the secretaries of the departments of agriculture , education , energy , health and human services , the interior , state , and veterans affairs ; and the director of the office of personnel management direct their cios to factor active risks into their it dashboard cio ratings ; the secretaries of the departments of defense , education , and homeland security ; and the commissioner of the social security administration direct their cios to update their cio ratings at least as frequently as required in omb's guidance ; and the secretaries of the departments of agriculture , commerce , defense , education , energy , health and human services , homeland security , state , transportation , the treasury , veterans affairs ; the administrator of the environmental protection agency ; and the commissioner of the social security administration direct their cios to ensure that their cio ratings reflect the level of risk facing an investment relative to that investment's ability to accomplish its goals .
