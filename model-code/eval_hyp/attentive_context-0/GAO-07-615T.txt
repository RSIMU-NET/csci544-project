i am pleased to have the opportunity to share information and perspectives with the committee as it examines issues concerning the financial performance of the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) .
specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) weaknesses in how fha has managed the risks of loans with down - payment assistance , ( 2 ) practices that could be instructive for fha in managing the risks of new mortgage products , ( 3 ) fha's development and use of a mortgage scorecard , and ( 4 ) fha's estimation of subsidy costs for its single - family insurance program .
whether under its existing authority or using any additional flexibility that congress may grant , fha's ability to manage risks and program changes will affect the financial performance of the insurance program .
in conducting this work , we reviewed and analyzed information concerning the standards and controls fha uses to manage the risks of loans with down - payment assistance ; steps mortgage industry participants take to design and implement low - and no - down - payment mortgage products ; fha's approach to developing its mortgage scorecard and the scorecard's benefits and limitations ; fha's estimates of program costs and the factors underlying the agency's cost reestimates ; and fha's plans and resources for implementing its proposed legislative changes .
