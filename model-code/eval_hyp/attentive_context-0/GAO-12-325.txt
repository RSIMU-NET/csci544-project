as american workers have increasingly come to rely on their 401 ( k ) plans for retirement income , policymakers have focused their attention on the fees charged to the plan sponsor — typically the employer offering the plan — and plan participants .
to help strengthen labor's ability to oversee 401 ( k ) plans , we recommend that in addition to labor's ongoing efforts , labor should evaluate whether individuals and service providers who exert significant control over the plan should be considered erisa fiduciaries .
on the basis of our research objectives , we obtained information on fee amounts paid by sponsors and participants for services , examined challenges sponsors faced in understanding how fees are charged , and identified actions the department of labor ( labor ) has taken to help sponsors understand and monitor fees .
our past work has shown that the amount of plan fees paid by participants can significantly reduce retirement savings and is dependent on several factors , including the decisions made by the plan sponsor to hire service providers — outside entities to help administer their plans .
what actions has the department of labor ( labor ) taken to help plan sponsors understand and monitor fees charged by service providers ? .
