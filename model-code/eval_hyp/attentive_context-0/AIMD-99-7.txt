as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to determine whether the sulphur mountain nexrad ( 1 ) can provide timely and accurate information for warning of flash floods and ( 2 ) is intended to provide low - level data necessary to predict wind shear for los angeles international airport .
in december 1994 , the national weather service ( nws ) began operating a next generation weather radar ( nexrad ) located on sulphur mountain in ventura county , california .
as a result of its continuing problems , the nws modernization has been included — both in 1995 and 1997 — on our list of high - risk government programs .
although nws acknowledges that key problems confront the new systems , it has found that the new radars and satellites have improved forecasts and warnings .
the institute concluded , among other things , that the location of the radar prevented it from performing its mission to provide accurate and timely information for warning of flash flooding in nearby communities and wind shear at nearby airports .
as part of its modernization program , nws plans to reorganize its field office structure from 256 offices ( 52 weather service forecast offices and 204 weather service offices ) , to 121 weather forecast offices ( wfo ) .
