in fiscal year 1994 , the federal government reported travel obligations for individuals of about $7.6 billion — about $5 billion for the department of defense ( dod ) and about $2.6 billion for the civilian agencies .
federal executives , operating in the current environment of reduction and change , face a difficult challenge .
they must cut costs while still maintaining , if not improving , operations .
real change , concrete improvements , and substantive cost savings will not occur until underlying processes are systematically reassessed and reengineered .
indeed , there has been a growing acknowledgement within government that what is needed is a revamping of how the government does what it does .
most efforts that have attempted to address this challenge have had to come to grips with the difficulties of change — change is easy to talk about , but it is much harder to accomplish .
a handful of federal agencies have also begun to implement best practices and reduce costs .
and the costs for improvement are low , especially given the potential return — hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved .
related primarily to two types of travel — temporary duty ( tdy ) and permanent relocation .
