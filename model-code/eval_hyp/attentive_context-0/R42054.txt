while much of the fy2007 to fy2013 increase in participation and costs was attributable to the poor economy , states during this period also increasingly adopted more expansive "categorical eligibility" rules â€” a set of policies that make a snap applicant eligible based on the applicant's involvement with other low - income assistance programs: benefits from the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , supplemental security income ( ssi ) , and state - financed general assistance ( ga ) programs .
the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) provided food assistance to a monthly average of 40.3 million persons in 20.1 million households in fy2018 .
while the statute on categorical eligibility has not changed in recent years , the trump administration has plans to change the policy via regulation .
the house - passed version of the bill would have made changes to limit but not eliminate broad - based categorical eligibility .
as a result , potential changes to curtail ( or expand ) categorical eligibility may impact some states more than others .
total benefit costs were $60.6 billion in fy2018 .
these proposals are discussed further in " recent proposals to change categorical eligibility . .
