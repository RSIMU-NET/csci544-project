at that time most states' budget forecasts predicted that the robust economy would continue providing strong revenue growth potential and , more important for states' temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) budgets , diminishing costs in many social services programs .
in the block grant environment , the federal government has an interest in encouraging states to save for future contingencies , but within a framework that recognizes that the size of the reserve will remain largely a state determination made under conditions of inherent uncertainty .
however , the flexibility of the grant combined with significant unspent tanf balances may help mitigate the fiscal fallout from economic downturns .
because states' new welfare programs remain untested in times of downturn , these uncertainties make it difficult for anyone to predict how states will respond and how former welfare recipients will be affected if and when economic conditions change .
the potential for states to draw on their tanf grants and state reserves to cushion fiscal and economic shocks to the program .
as we will discuss more fully later in this testimony , the data available on the levels and adequacy of states' reserves is insufficient and misleading .
