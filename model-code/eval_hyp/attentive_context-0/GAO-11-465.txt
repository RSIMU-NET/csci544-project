intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ) systems have proved critical to the combatant commanders to plan and execute military operations in iraq and afghanistan by providing them timely and accurate information on adversaries' capabilities and vulnerabilities .
the success of isr systems in collecting , processing , and disseminating useful intelligence information has fueled growing demand for more isr support , and the department of defense ( dod ) has increased its investments in isr capabilities significantly since 2002 .
to improve management of dod's isr enterprise and increase its ability to achieve efficiencies , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the usd ( i ) to take the following three actions: collect and aggregate complete financial data — including information on dual - use assets , urgent operational needs , capability funding from multiple sources , and military personnel funding — to inform resource and investment decisions .
under that mandate , this review examines the extent to which: ( 1 ) dod manages and oversees the full scope and cost of the isr enterprise ; ( 2 ) dod identified and minimized the potential for any unnecessary duplication in program , planning , and operations for isr ; and ( 3 ) dod's isr integration roadmap addresses key management elements required by law or directed by congressional committees .
