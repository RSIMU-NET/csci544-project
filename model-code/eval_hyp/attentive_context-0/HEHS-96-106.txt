because of your interest in ensuring that federal training programs accommodate small employers , you asked that we ( 1 ) provide information on the extent to which small employers participate in employment training programs of different types , ( 2 ) identify barriers that may limit their participation , and ( 3 ) discuss ways to address such barriers .
both government and the private sector currently devote significant resources to train our nation's workforce .
we reported in 1995 that the federal government alone spent about $20 billion on 163 programs that included some aspect of worker training .
generally , federal employment training programs target specific populations of workers , such as dislocated workers â€” those who have been or will be permanently laid off due to plant closures or corporate downsizing .
to obtain information on small employer training activities , their use of available training programs , and barriers they may face when participatingin programs , we reviewed pertinent literature and studies ; interviewed many officials from employer and other associations and federal agencies ; and analyzed the most recent employer surveys of training by the university of pennsylvania's national center for the educational quality of the workforce ( eqw ) , the department of labor's bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , and the university of kentucky ( performed under a grant from the small business administration ( sba ) ) .
