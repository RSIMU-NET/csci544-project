as you requested , we address in this report the views of pilots and other aircrew members of the air national guard and air force reserve regarding the anthrax vaccine immunization program ( avip ) of the department of defense ( dod ) .
concerns were also expressed about the anthrax vaccine and its possible effects on certain health issues such as fertility and the risk of increased autoimmune disease .
dod had to restrict the mandatory anthrax program because of the shortage of anthrax vaccine .
bioport has now received fda's approval to resume production .
this dissatisfaction appeared to be especially high concerning such key factors as the military threat from anthrax , the anthrax vaccine's battlefield effectiveness , the vaccine's history and past usage , the short - term and long - term safety risks of the vaccine , and the possible side effects from and reactions to the vaccine .
the perpetrator — individual , group , or other entity — responsible for sending the anthrax letters has not yet been identified .
these tragedies were followed in october 2001 by the mailing of anthrax - laced letters that killed five people in the united states .
