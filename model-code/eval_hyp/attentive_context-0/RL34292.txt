the context for congressional interest may include policy concerns such as: the role of ipr in the u.s. economy ; the impact of ipr infringement on u.s. commercial , health , safety , and security interests ; and the balance between protecting ipr to stimulate innovation and advancing other public policy goals .
intellectual property rights ( ipr ) traditionally have been matters of national concern .
over time , ipr protection and enforcement have come to the forefront as a key international trade issue for the united states — largely due to the role of intellectual property in an innovative u.s. economy and competitive advantage — and figure prominently in the multilateral trade policy arena and in regional and bilateral u.s. free trade agreements ( ftas ) .
this report discusses the different types of ipr and ipr infringement ; the role of ipr in the u.s. economy ; estimated losses associated with ipr infringement ; the organizational structure of ipr protection and u.s. trade policy ; and issues for congress regarding ipr and international trade .
congress has legislative , oversight , and appropriations responsibilities related to ipr and trade policy .
individual nation states have developed ipr regimes reflecting their domestic needs and priorities .
