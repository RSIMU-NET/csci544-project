as you requested , i will first briefly summarize state experiences and then focus on provisions regarding gao , the budget enforcement act ( bea ) , and for the government performance and results act ( gpra ) .
at the beginning of the second session of the congress the president would submit a “mid - biennium review.” this second year then would be devoted to authorizations , which would be required to cover at least 2 years ; to revenue legislation , which also would be required to cover at least 2 years ; and to oversight of federal programs .
s. 261 would change the cycle for the president's budget , for the budget resolution , for enactment of appropriations , and for authorizations to a biennial cycle .
in addition , for those entities for which the congress has recognized a programmatic need to have appropriations immediately available at the beginning of the fiscal year ( such as grants to states for medicaid ) , the congress has accommodated this need with advance appropriations .
gao reviews of the supplemental security income program have highlighted several long - standing problem areas: ( 1 ) determining initial and continuing financial eligibility for beneficiaries , ( 2 ) determining disability eligibility and performing continuing disability reviews , and ( 3 ) inadequate return - to - work assistance for recipients who may be assimilated back into the work force .
