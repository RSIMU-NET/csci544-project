on june 30 , 2007 , the united states and south korea signed the u.s. - south korea free trade agreement ( korus fta ) .
if approved by congress , it would be the second - largest u.s. free - trade agreement in terms of the value of trade affected , next to the north american free trade agreement , nafta .
on december 3 , 2010 , the united states and south korea reached a further agreement that modified the auto sector provisions .
nonetheless , these provisions have continued to generate considerable debate in congress .
one prominent issue in that discussion is the agreement's specific rules of origin ( roo ) for automobiles and auto parts .
the provisions concerning automobiles and auto parts are among the most controversial elements of the korus fta .
these rules will be used to determine if automotive goods imported from south korea are eligible to receive duty - free or reduced tariff benefits under the korus fta , and whether automotive goods from the united states are eligible for corresponding benefits upon export to south korea .
it then explains the procedures established in the korus fta for determining whether an automotive product qualifies as being of south korean or united states origin and compares those procedures to the rules established in the free trade agreement between south korea and the european union .
