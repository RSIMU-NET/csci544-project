my testimony today will focus on four key issues as they relate to the implementation of the chafee program: 1. how states' funding allocations for independent living programs compare when considering the number of youth eligible for services , 2. the extent to which states have expanded independent living services and age groups for youth in foster care after the passage of fcia and what challenges remain , 3. the extent to which states have used other federal and state programs to coordinate the delivery of independent living services to foster care youth , and 4. how the states and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) have fulfilled the program accountability provisions of the law and assessed the effectiveness of independent living services .
in response to concerns that youth leave foster care poorly prepared to live self - sufficiently , in 1986 congress created the independent living program , which was further strengthened with the passage of the foster care independence act of 1999 ( fcia ) and creation of the john h. chafee foster care independence program ( chafee program ) .
research studies have shown that many of these young people face serious problems once on their own , including homelessness , a lack of education and stable employment , and difficulties obtaining medical and mental health services .
