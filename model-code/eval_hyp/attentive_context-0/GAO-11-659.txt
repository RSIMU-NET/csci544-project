cta required the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to ( 1 ) initiate and complete a rulemaking proceeding to prescribe standards regulating commercial advertising transmitted during children's television programs , ( 2 ) limit the duration of advertising that may be shown during children's television programs , and ( 3 ) consider the extent to which a broadcast station has served the educational and informational needs of children through its overall programming when reviewing a station's application to continue broadcasting .
