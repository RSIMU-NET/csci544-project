although there is some interest in increasing the current level of hydropower investment , such investment remains limited , in part because of federal and nonfederal financial constraints , high uncertainty in electricity generation policies and markets ( which may dissuade capital investment ) , and the environmental operating requirements required for hydropower projects .
the united states has considerable hydropower potential beyond what is already developed .
conventional hydropower accounted for more than 6% ( 258,749 gigawatt hours ) of total net u.s. electricity generation in 2014 .
at issue for the 114 th congress is whether , and if so how , to change federal support for hydropower and what priority to give hydropower vis - Ã  - vis other energy investments , and social and environmental concerns .
so far , four hydropower - related bills have been introduced in the 114 th congress: s. 1236 ( hydropower improvement act of 2015 ) , s. 1264 ( renewable electricity standard act ) , s. 1338 ( small hydropower dependable regulatory order act of 2015 ) , and s. 1270 ( reliable investment in vital energy resources [river] act ) .
