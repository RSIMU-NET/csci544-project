as you requested , this report provides information on ( 1 ) the profiles of three power marketing administrations , including their similarities and differences and their interactions with the agencies that operate federal water projects ; ( 2 ) the general parameters of the process by which federally owned assets can be sold ; and ( 3 ) the factors that would have to be addressed in a divestiture of federal hydroelectric assets , such as the relationship between power generation and the other purposes of federal water projects .
in some cases , the pmas are not required to recover some costs ( for example , certain environmental costs and the full costs of federal pensions and postretirement health benefits ) because of specific legal provisions or because the doe implementing order excludes the costs or is not specific about them .
they include municipalities and cooperatives ; public utility districts ; irrigation districts ; federal agencies , including military and laboratory installations ; and state agencies .
we agreed to provide information on ( 1 ) southeastern , southwestern , and western , including their similarities and differences , and their interactions with the agencies that operate federal water projects ( mostly , the bureau and the corps ) ; ( 2 ) the main objectives and general decisions involved in divesting federal assets , along with how these objectives and decisions apply to the pmas ; and ( 3 ) the specific issues related to hydropower that should be addressed before a divestiture of the pmas .
