given this observation and the continued growth in the di and ssi programs , the senate committee on finance asked us to ( 1 ) examine the proportion of beneficiaries who are removed from the disability programs because they have improved medically and ( 2 ) determine if factors associated with the standard pose challenges when determining whether beneficiaries continue to be eligible for benefits .
more specifically , ssa should clarify guidance concerning ( 1 ) what degree of improvement is required to meet the standard and ( 2 ) when the use of exceptions to medical improvement is appropriate .
this appendix provides additional details about our analysis of the medical improvement standard ( the standard ) , including challenges the standard poses for the social security administration ( ssa ) when conducting medical continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) .
in fiscal year 2005 , the social security administration ( ssa ) paid about $126 billion to approximately 12.8 million beneficiaries under the disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs .
ssa is required to conduct periodic continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) to ensure that only eligible people continue to receive benefits .
