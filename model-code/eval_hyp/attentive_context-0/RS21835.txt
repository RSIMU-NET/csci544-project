official travel may involve , for example , presenting information ; giving direction ; and explaining , and securing public support for , administration policies .
trips by the president , vice president , and first lady are almost always classified as official travel or political travel , or a combination of the two .
the guidelines evolved in response to general legal principles that federal funds are to be used only for the purposes for which they are appropriated , opinions from the office of legal counsel in the department of justice , rules of the federal election commission ( fec ) , and occasional audits by the general accounting office ( gao ) .
the terms are rather general , and the white house determines whether a trip is for official or political purposes , or for a combination of the two .
official , or nonpolitical , travel is normally defined as anything having to do with the carrying out of presidential duties and responsibilities .
the guidelines , which also cover the first lady and the vice president's spouse , apply only to trips in the united states and its territories , since all foreign travel is considered official .
