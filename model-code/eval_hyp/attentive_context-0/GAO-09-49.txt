our objectives in this report were to determine to what extent ( 1 ) dod has guidance that establishes the biometrics data to be collected to support military activities and ( 2 ) there may be gaps in biometrics information shared between dod and dhs .
we focused the scope of our work on the department of defense ( dod ) , the four military services ( army , navy , marine corps , and air force ) , the department of state ( dos ) , the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. - visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program office , and the department of justice's federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) .
the events of september 11 , 2001 , and operations to defeat insurgents in afghanistan and iraq have made it increasingly critical for military units to identify individuals they encounter in the field and share this information with other units and certain federal agencies .
in military activities , dod uses biometrics to identify and verify individuals encountered in the field as friend , foe , or neutral ; to operate detention facilities ; to protect dod personnel at expeditionary bases in theater ( force protection ) ; and to recover and identify u.s. personnel in afghanistan and iraq .
