agencies use regulations to carry out statutory directives to achieve public policy goals , such as protecting the health and safety of the public .
specifically , this testimony discusses ( 1 ) the identity information selected agencies collect through regulations.gov and agency - specific comment websites , ( 2 ) the internal guidance selected agencies have related to the identity of commenters , ( 3 ) how selected agencies treat identity information collected during the public comment process , and ( 4 ) the extent to which selected agencies clearly communicate their practices associated with posting identity information collected during the public comment process .
under the apa , agencies engage in three basic phases of the rulemaking process: ( 1 ) initiate rulemaking actions , ( 2 ) develop proposed rulemaking actions , or notices of proposed rulemaking ( nprm ) , and ( 3 ) develop final rulemaking actions .
the administrative procedure act ( apa ) establishes procedures for rulemaking , which is the process agencies follow to develop and issue regulations .
while the apa does not include requirements for commenters to provide identity information , or for agency officials to include commenters' identity as part of their consideration of comments , key practices for transparently reporting open government data state that federal government websites — like those used to facilitate the public comment process — should fully describe the data that are made available to the public , including by disclosing data sources and limitations .
