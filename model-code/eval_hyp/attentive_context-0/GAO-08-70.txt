in response to these questions , we examined: ( 1 ) what professional development dod provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and how the fiscal years 2004-to - 2006 funds designated for this purpose were used , ( 2 ) what identification and instructional services dod provides to students who may have dyslexia , and ( 3 ) how dod assesses the academic achievement of students with disabilities , including dyslexia .
the children of many of our nation's military and civilian personnel overseas and on certain military bases in the united states depend on the department of defense ( dod ) schools to meet their educational needs â€” from prekindergarten through 12th grade .
while dod has broad authority to use these funds for general operations and maintenance expenses , your committee expressed interest in whether and how dod provides support to students with dyslexia .
