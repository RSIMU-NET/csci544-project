given the recent expansion of these programs , we examined them to determine ( 1 ) how institutions used their title iii and title v grants and the benefits they received from using these grant funds , ( 2 ) what objectives and strategies the department of education ( education ) has developed for title iii and title v programs , and ( 3 ) to what extent education monitors and provides assistance to title iii and title v institutions .
appropriations for these programs have nearly doubled from about $230 million in fiscal year 1999 to about $432 million in fiscal year 2004 .
to determine how institutions used title iii and title v funds and the resulting benefits , we developed a data collection instrument and reviewed grant files for a stratified random sample of 104 of the 206 title iii and title v grant recipients , including the grant application , grant performance reports , and related correspondence .
