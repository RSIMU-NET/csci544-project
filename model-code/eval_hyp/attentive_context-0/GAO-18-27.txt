according to dod , one of the contributing factors to its inability to produce auditable financial statements is the billions of dollars of unsupported journal vouchers ( jv ) within its accounting systems , with the largest portion attributed to the department of the army's ( army ) general fund .
the department of defense ( dod ) has been on gao's high - risk list since 1995 in part because of long - standing , uncorrected deficiencies with its financial management systems , business processes , financial manager qualifications , and material internal control and financial reporting weaknesses .
