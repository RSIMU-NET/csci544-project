these included whether the state law specified ( 1 ) required reporting to ncic , namus , or other federal databases ; ( 2 ) reporting requirements for specific populations ; ( 3 ) a timeframe for reporting missing persons cases ; and ( 4 ) a timeframe for reporting unidentified remains .
to allow for more efficient use of data on missing and unidentified persons contained in the ncic's missing persons and unidentified persons files and namus , the directors of the fbi and nij should evaluate the feasibility of sharing certain information among authorized users , document the results of this evaluation , and incorporate , as appropriate , legally and technically feasible options for sharing the information .
in fiscal year 2015 , approximately 87 percent of these cases were resolved within 30 days , while the remaining 13 percent — or more than 84,000 people — became long - term missing persons cases .
additionally , we have reported that federal agencies have hundreds of incompatible information - technology networks and systems that hinder governmentwide sharing of information and , as a result , information technology solutions can be identified to help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of these systems .
