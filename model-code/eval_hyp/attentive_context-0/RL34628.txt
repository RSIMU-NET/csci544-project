these money accounts , known as iims ( an abbreviation for individual indian monies ) are monies which the federal government holds for the benefit of individual indians rather than property held for the benefit of an indian tribe .
in 1994 , congress enacted the indian trust fund management reform act ( the reform act ) , recognizing the federal government's pre - existing trust responsibilities and further identifying some of the interior secretary's trust fund responsibilities , such as providing adequate accounting for trust fund balances ; providing adequate controls over receipts and disbursements ; providing accurate and timely reconciliations ; preparing and supplying periodic statements of account performance and balances to account holders ; and establishing consistent , written policies and procedures for trust fund management .
first filed in 1996 , cobell v. salazar involved the department of the interior's ( doi's ) management of several money accounts .
they include ( 1 ) land - based accounts — established to receive revenues derived from the approximately 11 million acres held in trust by the u.s. for individual indians ; ( 2 ) special deposit accounts ( sdas ) — intended to be temporary accounts to hold funds that could not be immediately credited to the proper iim account holder ; and ( 3 ) judgment and per capita accounts — established to receive funds from tribal distributions of litigation settlements and tribal revenues .
