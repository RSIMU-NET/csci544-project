to strengthen the federal role in ensuring the delivery of epsdt services and to bring greater visibility to ways that states can better serve children in medicaid , we recommend that the administrator of cms: work with states to develop criteria and time frames for consistently assessing and improving epsdt reporting and the provision of services , including requiring that states develop improvement plans as appropriate for achieving the epsdt goal of providing health services to children in medicaid ; and develop a mechanism for sharing information among states on successful state , plan , and provider practices for reaching children in medicaid .
medicaid , a joint federal and state program , finances health coverage for 21 million , or more than one in four , of the nation's children .
attempts to improve reporting have been time - consuming , and progress has been slow .
in its position of setting federal policy and assessing a broad array of state activities intended to help reach at - risk medicaid children , cms can help build on successful efforts by sharing successes among states and working with the many different agencies and parties to ensure a coordinated approach to this care .
