the effects are not trivial ; the zebra mussel alone is estimated to have caused $750 million to $1 billion in costs between 1989 and 2000 .
today , i am going to provide some information on the legislative and regulatory history of ballast water management and discuss some issues that pose challenges for the federal government's program for preventing the introduction of invasive species into u.s. waters from ships' ballast water discharges , including an update on concerns that we identified in our 2002 report .
the environment and economy of the chesapeake bay , san francisco bay , puget sound , and other coastal areas have also been affected by species transported in ballast water .
numerous harmful species have been introduced into u.s. waters via ballast water and have caused serious economic and ecologic damage .
as you know , many of these species are now permanent residents in u.s. ecosystems and have significantly altered the structure of these systems , or promise to do so in the future .
we reported in 2002 that at least 160 nonnative aquatic species had become established in the great lakes since the 1800s , more than one - third of which had been introduced in the prior 30 years .
