my testimony today will revisit and update the challenges we identified in previous reports , specifically ( 1 ) nfip's financial challenges , ( 2 ) fema's operational and management challenges relating to nfip , and ( 3 ) actions needed to address these challenges .
gao placed nfip on its high - risk list in march 2006 , not only because of the program's potential to incur billions of dollars in losses and the many financial challenges it faces , but also because of operational and management challenges within fema , many of which we have identified in previous reports to congress .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) and the challenges that the federal emergency management administration ( fema ) faces in administering it .
our previous reports identified many of these weaknesses , including subsidized premium rates , rate - setting methods that do not reflect the actual risk of losses due to flooding , and claims arising from a small number of repetitive loss properties .
these revenue shortfalls reflect both the devastating effects of catastrophic hurricanes and structural weaknesses in the way the program is funded .
