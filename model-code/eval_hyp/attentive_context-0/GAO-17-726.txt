asset management firms registered in the united states managed more than $70 trillion as of may 2017 , but asset management firms owned by minorities or women ( mwo asset managers or firms ) manage less than 1 percent of these assets .
to determine how federal entities and the national railroad retirement investment trust identified and selected asset managers and their efforts to include mwo firms , we analyzed investment policies ; documentation on selection processes and criteria ; and documentation on programs , policies , or initiatives related to mwo asset managers .
in this report we examined ( 1 ) the challenges minority - and women - owned ( mwo ) asset managers may face when competing for investment opportunities , and practices used by selected state , local , and private entities that administer or oversee retirement plans and foundations to increase opportunities for mwo firms ; ( 2 ) the major asset classes in which selected federal entities invested , their use of mwo firms , and the market presence of mwo firms in these asset classes ; and ( 3 ) the policies and processes selected federal entities use to identify and select asset management firms , and their use of key practices to increase opportunities for mwo firms .
