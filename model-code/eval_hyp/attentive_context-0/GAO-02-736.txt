the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions , mergers , or takeovers of u.s. companies if ( 1 ) there is credible evidence that a foreign controlling interest might threaten national security and ( 2 ) legislation , other than exon - florio and the international emergency economic powers act , does not adequately or appropriately protect national security .
further , to ensure compliance with agreements concluded under the authority of exon - florio , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury , in his capacity as chair of the committee on foreign investment in the united states , ( 1 ) increase the specificity of actions required by mitigation measures in future agreements negotiated under the authority of exon - florio and ( 2 ) designate in the agreement the agency responsible for overseeing implementation and monitoring compliance with mitigation measures .
exon - florio and implementing regulations provide the committee with broad discretion to evaluate and make decisions about issues of potential national security risk .
both treasury and defense disagreed with our recommendations ( 1 ) for interim measures to protect national security when companies that have completed an acquisition are allowed to withdraw their notification and ( 2 ) that increased specificity of actions be required by mitigation measures in future agreements negotiated under the authority of exon - florio .
