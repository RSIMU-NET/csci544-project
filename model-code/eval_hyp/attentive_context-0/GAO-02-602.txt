as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we will describe ( 1 ) the health care benefit targeted to women covered under the tricare program and how this benefit compares to national clinical guidelines and other health plans' offerings and ( 2 ) women beneficiaries' satisfaction with and concerns about dod's health care benefit .
about half of all beneficiaries who are eligible to use tricare , the department of defense's ( dod ) health care program , are women â€” either active duty personnel , family members , or retirees .
to conduct our work , we reviewed relevant policies and procedures and interviewed officials from dod's health affairs' office of clinical and program policy ; dod's tricare management activity ( tma ) ; and the surgeons general offices for the air force , army , and navy .
with a health care system historically oriented towards men , dod has been challenged to ensure that its women beneficiaries receive the full range of services including primary , specialty , preventive , and reproductive care .
the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2002 directed that we study the adequacy and quality of the health care provided to women by dod .
