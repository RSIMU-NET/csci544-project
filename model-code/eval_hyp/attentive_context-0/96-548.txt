like any legislative institution , the senate is both a deliberative and a decision - making body ; its procedures must embody some balance between the opportunity to deliberate or debate and the need to decide .
the essential characteristic of the senate's rules , and the characteristic that most clearly distinguishes its procedures from those of the house of representatives , is their emphasis on the rights and prerogatives of individual senators .
the legislative process on the senate floor is governed by a set of standing rules , a body of precedents created by rulings of presiding officers or by votes of the senate , a variety of established and customary practices , and ad hoc arrangements the senate makes to meet specific parliamentary and political circumstances .
therefore , the senate has developed a variety of practices by which senators set aside some of their prerogatives under the rules to expedite the conduct of its business or to accommodate the needs and interests of its members .
a knowledge of the senate's formal rules is not sufficient to understand senate procedures , and senate practices cannot be understood without knowing the rules to which the practices relate .
