all of the services used stop loss at the beginning of operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) but only the army has consistently employed some form of stop loss over the past nine years .
stop loss is a frequently misunderstood dod force management program that retains servicemembers beyond their contractually agreed - to separation date .
while many observers tend to sympathize with those in stop loss status , others assert that every servicemember who has enlisted or reenlisted over the past several years has been made aware of the program .
today , there are nearly 8,000 soldiers in the active army , army reserve and army national guard who remain on active duty beyond their scheduled separation date as a result of stop loss .
stop loss was initially used in the 1990-91 persian gulf war and later in bosnia and the kosovo air campaign .
because of the involuntary nature of this extension , some critics have referred to the program as a "backdoor draft" or "involuntary servitude" .
with the reserves ordered to active duty and the proclamation of a national emergency , the secretary of defense can approve implementation of programs such as stop loss .
