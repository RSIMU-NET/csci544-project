specifically , we ( 1 ) determined the jsf program's progress in meeting cost , schedule , and performance goals ; and ( 2 ) identified the challenges and risk the program will face in meeting these goals in the future .
the joint strike fighter ( jsf ) is the department of defense's ( dod ) most expensive aircraft acquisition program .
in 2006 congress reduced the number of production aircraft to be funded in fiscal year 2007 and the number of aircraft to receive advanced procurement funds for aircraft to be procured in fiscal year 2008 .
there are also important competing priorities external to dod's budget .
the program has experienced delays in several key events including delays in the start of the flight test program , manufacturing and delivery of the first development aircraft , and delays in the testing of critical missions systems .
as a result , purchase quantities have been reduced , total program costs have increased , and delivery of the initial aircraft has been delayed .
jsf is a central part of dod's overall recapitalization strategy for its tactical aircraft fleet , representing 90 percent of the remaining planned investment for its major tactical aircraft programs .
