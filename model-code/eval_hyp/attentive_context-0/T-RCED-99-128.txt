my comments today are based on a number of reports we have issued in recent years that relate to three specific issues: ( 1 ) progress made toward cleaning up sites in the program , ( 2 ) continuing management problems , and ( 3 ) factors affecting superfund's future workload .
these problems include the difficulty in controlling contract costs , the failure to recover certain federal cleanup costs from the parties who are responsible for the contaminated sites , and the selection of sites for cleanup without assurance that they are the most dangerous sites to human health and the environment .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the current status and management of the superfund program and the outlook for the program's future .
decisions about how to clean up the great majority of these sites have been made , and the construction of cleanup remedies has been completed at over 40 percent of the sites .
despite the progress that superfund has made toward site cleanups , certain management problems persist .
furthermore , our analysis indicates that the costs of on - site work by cleanup contractors represent less than half of the spending in the program .
