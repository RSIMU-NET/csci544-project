684 ( representative womack and others ) would grant ssuta member states and non - member states that meet less rigorous simplifications standards the authority to compel out - of - state vendors with greater than $1 million in remote sales to collect sales and use taxes .
in hopes of stemming the potential loss of tax revenue , several states are participating in an initiative to simplify and coordinate their tax codes — called the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ( ssuta ) .
this concern arises in part because the u.s. supreme court ruled out - of - state vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which they ( the vendors ) do not have nexus .
s. 1832 ( senator enzi and others including senator durbin ) would have granted ssuta member states and non - member states that met less rigorous simplifications standards the authority to compel out - of - state vendors to collect sales and use taxes .
