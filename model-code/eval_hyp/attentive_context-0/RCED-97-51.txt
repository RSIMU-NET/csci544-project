since the early 1980s , faa's modernization efforts have experienced lengthy schedule delays and substantial cost overruns .
because of such problems , in 1994 , faa restructured its acquisition of the advanced automation system — the long - time centerpiece of its air traffic control modernization program — into more manageable segments .
specifically , you asked us to determine to what extent ( 1 ) the schedule estimate for stars is attainable and ( 2 ) cost estimates to make stars operational are likely to change .
faa projects that it cannot meet projected traffic increases and make required safety and efficiency enhancements without replacing equipment .
the federal aviation administration ( faa ) oversees the largest , busiest , and most complex air traffic control system in the world .
however , components of the system are aging and are difficult and costly to maintain .
one of these segments is called the standard terminal automation replacement system ( stars ) project .
this project is expected to replace 15- to 25-year - old computers and related equipment used at faa facilities that track aircraft in the airspace surrounding airports .
given faa's past schedule and cost problems and the significance of the stars project , you asked us to examine faa's acquisition planning to date .
