in november 2011 , president obama and leaders of the european union ( eu ) named a high level working group on jobs and growth to recommend steps to broaden transatlantic economic ties .
the negotiations , the president wrote , would seek greater compatibility of u.s. and eu regulations and related standards development processes , with the objective of reducing costs associated with unnecessary regulatory differences and facilitating trade , inter alia by promoting transparency in the development and implementation of regulations and good regulatory practices , establishing mechanisms for future progress , and pursuing regulatory cooperation initiatives where appropriate .
one month later , president obama notified congress that the united states would enter into negotiations with the eu to seek a free trade agreement , referred to as the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) .
in its final report , issued in february 2013 , the working group called for a new bilateral agreement to govern transatlantic trade and investment .
trade in vehicles and parts between the united states and the eu reached $57 billion in 2012 , and numerous companies manufacture on both sides of the atlantic .
the major u.s. and european motor vehicle manufacturer associations have called for ttip to provide for mutual recognition of existing technical standards and the creation of a u.s. - eu process for harmonization of future vehicle regulations .
