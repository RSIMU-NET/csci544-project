this year's loss of roughly half of the country's supply of flu vaccine highlighted what has become a growing problem â€” the fragility of the vaccine production and distribution system .
my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) the challenges in ensuring adequate supply to meet demand for vaccine and ( 2 ) the mechanisms in place to target high - risk populations when , as happened this year , a vaccine shortage occurs .
we obtained information on ( 1 ) the available doses and demand for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 flu seasons , ( 2 ) the status of this year's flu vaccine , and ( 3 ) cdc activities , including actions taken following the announcement that one major manufacturer could not supply any vaccine for the u.s. market this year .
our prior work on flu vaccine included analysis of information provided by and interviews with department of health and human services ( hhs ) officials , vaccine manufacturers , medical distributors and their trade associations , companies that provide flu vaccinations at retail outlets and work sites , physician and other professional associations , and other purchasers .
only three manufacturers produce flu vaccine for the u.s. market , and the potential for future manufacturing problems such as those experienced both this year and to a lesser degree in previous years is still present .
