because of your particular interest in the use of impact evaluations as a way of determining program effectiveness , our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe the value of conducting impact evaluations , ( 2 ) describe their current use in evaluating selected early childhood education and care programs , and ( 3 ) discuss the value of other types of early childhood education and care studies the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) and education currently promote and sponsor .
these funds provided a variety of services and support to children and their families to meet a range of goals , from increasing low - income families' access to affordable child care to ensuring that children's educational , health , and social needs are met .
in 1999 , at least $9 billion in federal funds supported early education and care services for children younger than 5 .
to understand the use of impact evaluations , we reviewed current government - sponsored studies ( both agency - initiated and congressionally mandated ) of 11 programs that fund early childhood education and care and report serving 25,000 or more children younger than age 5 .
