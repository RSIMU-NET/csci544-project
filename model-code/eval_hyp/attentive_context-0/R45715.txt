the 116 th congress continues its interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .
in recent years , some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the federal deficit and debt .
the remainder of the report discusses and analyzes the r&d budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that , collectively , account for approximately 99% of total federal r&d funding .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites , shale gas extraction , and defenses against disease .
as congress acts to complete the fy2020 appropriations process , it faces two overarching issues: the amount of the federal budget to be spent on federal r&d and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding .
in recent years , widespread concerns about the federal debt , recent and projected federal budget deficits , and federal budget caps have driven difficult decisions about the prioritization of r&d , both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal r&d portfolio .
