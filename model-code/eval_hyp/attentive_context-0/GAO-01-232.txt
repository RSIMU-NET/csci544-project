sometimes referred to as “electronic government” or “e - gov,” the use of it has already changed how public policy is developed and administered in a variety of areas and has the potential to introduce even more changes in the future .
specifically , we agreed to identify ( 1 ) examples of how federal agencies are innovatively using it , either individually or in collaboration with other agencies or levels of government , to facilitate regulatory management ; ( 2 ) examples of how state regulatory agencies are innovatively using it to facilitate regulatory management ; ( 3 ) it applications that representatives of nongovernmental organizations believe could be more widely used by federal regulatory agencies ; and ( 4 ) what officials and staff in federal and state regulatory agencies and nongovernmental organizations believe are the key factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption and diffusion of innovative it applications in regulatory management .
the use of it in regulatory management can reduce regulatory burden ; improve the transparency of regulatory processes ; and , ultimately , facilitate the accomplishment of regulatory objectives .
during the past several years , information technology ( it ) has played an increasingly important role in how federal agencies interact with the public and accomplish their missions .
