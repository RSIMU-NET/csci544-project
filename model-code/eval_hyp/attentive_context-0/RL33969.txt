on march 5 , 2007 , donor nations began to discuss a fifteenth replenishment of funds for the world bank's ( the bank ) concessional lending facility , the international development association ( ida ) .
the mdri cancels the remaining debt of the world's poorest countries , and pledges to double the amount of aid to sub - saharan africa between 2004 and 2010 , primarily in the form of grant - based assistance .
this is the first replenishment since the 2005 g8 summit at the gleneagles resort in scotland , where world leaders proposed the creation of the multilateral debt relief initiative ( mdri ) .
if other donors are not in broad support of the u.s. aid agenda , the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid through the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) or another u.s. agency .
it is also the first replenishment since the 2005 paris declaration on aid harmonization , in which ida and over 100 other signatories agreed to increase coordination among donors in an effort to raise aid effectiveness .
the lack of coordination of donors on the one hand , and the increasing restrictions on projects themselves through donor earmarks and time limits on the other , have raised the cost and difficulty for implementing foreign aid .
