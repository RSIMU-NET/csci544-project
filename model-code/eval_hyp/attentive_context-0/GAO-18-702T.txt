specifically , this testimony addresses ( 1 ) irs's efforts to address its authentication challenges , ( 2 ) irs's progress in implementing its authentication strategy , and ( 3 ) additional steps we identified that irs could take to enhance its authentication programs and stay ahead of fraudsters .
in fiscal year 2017 , irs issued approximately $383 billion in individual tax refunds , including overpayment refunds and refundable tax credits , an increase of about $16 billion from the previous fiscal year .
further , we found that irs does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement nist's new guidance for secure online authentication and also lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies , which could provide taxpayers additional options to actively protect their identity .
in an environment with an increasing risk of fraud , identity theft ( idt ) , and cyberattacks , irs must ensure that its preventative security controls provide the agency with reasonable assurance that it is interacting with the legitimate taxpayer .
identifying resources and prioritizing activities in its roadmap will help irs clarify tradeoffs between costs , benefits , and risks and aid in decision making .
