such a shift in focus should include ( 1 ) taking full advantage of the periodic on - site visits already conducted at every nursing home nationwide through the routine state survey process , ( 2 ) ensuring that the federal mds review process is designed and sufficient to consistently assess the performance of all states' reviews for mds accuracy , and ( 3 ) providing additional guidance , training , and other technical guidance to states as needed to facilitate their efforts .
under the medicare and medicaid programs , nursing homes were expected to receive $58 billion in 2001 , with a federal share of approximately $38 billion .
we also interviewed staff from the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that manages the medicare and medicaid programs , who were responsible for developing the agency's mds review program .
the federal government contracts with states to periodically inspect or survey nursing homes , and state surveyors use mds data to help assess the quality of resident care.medicare and some state medicaid programs also use mds data to adjust nursing home payments to account for variation in resident care needs .
