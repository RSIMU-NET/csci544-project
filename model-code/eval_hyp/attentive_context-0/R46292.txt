r ecently , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) announced that it would only accept mailed freedom of information act ( foia ) requests and not those submitted electronically due to the covid - 19 pandemic .
conversely , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) has adopted a contrasting policy , saying that cdc would not be able to respond to mailed foia requests and that requests should be placed electronically .
these examples of differing policies , among others examples not mentioned , when combined with agencies' adoption of additional telework flexibilities , raise questions about how agencies will be responding to foia requests in the near future .
government information requests through foia may be impacted by covid - 19 in two ways: ( 1 ) certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration ; and ( 2 ) processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave .
this report provides an overview of the foia request process and actual and potential foia request processing changes within federal government agencies as a result of covid - 19 .
