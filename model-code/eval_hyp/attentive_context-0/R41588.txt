health insurance premiums represent a contractually agreed upon amount to be paid for a defined set of health benefits during a defined period of time ( usually a year ) .
premiums are typically paid in monthly installments by policyholders ( individual coverage ) and enrollees ( group coverage ) .
rates may vary by age and sex and may also be underwritten , meaning that the insurance carrier assesses the health status of the insurance applicant and uses it to set the rate according to the health risk of that individual .
rating methodologies generally vary between health insurance market segments and may have additional state - specific variation due to differences in state rate regulations .
premiums may vary for different individuals with the same health benefits package from the same insurance company .
state regulators have adopted solvency standards to protect consumers by requiring insurance companies to keep certain reserves of capital to protect against asset risks , underwriting or insurance risk , and business risks .
the growth of health insurance premiums ( and out - of - pocket costs ) for individuals and families has been the focus of considerable congressional attention .
cms will evaluate ( and may re - evaluate ) whether a state has such a program in place , according to the following criteria: the state collects data and documentation from issuers that are sufficient enough to examine ( 1 ) the validity of assumptions used to develop the proposed rate increase , and ( 2 ) past projections and actual experience .
