since the united states threatened financial sanctions on banks that do business with north korea in september 2005 , pyongyang had boycotted the six - party talks ( with south korea , japan , china, and russia ) , the multilateral forum dedicated to eliminating north korea's nuclear weapons program .
the short - term implications of north korea's nuclear test are clear: whether a technical success or failure , north korea's willingness to carry out a test in the face of significant opposition indicates that it is willing to endure the potential consequences .
on october 9 , 2006 , north korea ( formally the democratic people's republic of korea ) announced it conducted a nuclear test .
the most fundamental u.s. goals of the confrontation with north korea are to prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to prevent an attack — either nuclear or conventional — on the united states or on its allies in the region .
it also requires the executive branch to report to congress every 180 days in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 on the status of north korea's nuclear and missile programs .
