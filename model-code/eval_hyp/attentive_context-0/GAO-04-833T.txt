in examining depository institutions for bsa compliance , the regulators' examination procedures are to serve as a tool for determining whether depository institutions ( 1 ) have developed aml programs and procedures to adequately detect , deter , and report unusual or suspicious activities possibly related to money laundering ; and ( 2 ) comply with the technical recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the bsa .
the u.s. government's framework for preventing , detecting , and prosecuting money laundering has been expanding through additional pieces of legislation since its inception in 1970 with the bank secrecy act .
the 1986 act also directed the regulators ( 1 ) to issue regulations that require the financial institutions subject to their respective jurisdiction “to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor the compliance of such institutions ; ” ( 2 ) to review such procedures during the course of each examination of such financial institutions ; ( 3 ) to issue cease and desist orders to ensure compliance with the requirements ; and ( 4 ) to assess civil money penalties for failure to maintain such compliance procedures .
specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) recent enforcement actions taken against depository institutions for bsa violations , ( 2 ) inspectors general reports assessing the regulators' examination work and enforcement activities , and ( 3 ) issues raised in some of our past work on money laundering and ongoing work on bsa examinations and enforcement for the committee .
