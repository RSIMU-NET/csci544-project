arguably the most significant incentive for ethanol's use is the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) established in the energy policy act of 2005 and expanded in the energy independence and security act of 2007 .
in 2010 , the united states consumed roughly 13 billion gallons of fuel ethanol , representing about 10% of all u.s. gasoline consumption ( by volume ) .
fuel ethanol consumption has grown from roughly 1 billion gallons per year in the early 1990s , largely as a result of federal policies promoting its use , including tax incentives and mandates for the use of renewable fuels .
the rfs mandates the use of 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008 , increasing steadily through 2022 ( figure 1 ) .
there is continuing interest in the potential for ethanol to displace petroleum as a transportation fuel .
currently , although some ethanol is sold as an alternative fuel ( e85 ) , most is sold as an additive in conventional and reformulated gasoline .
however , a limit of 10% ethanol would mean that ethanol for gasoline blending ( not including e85 ) likely cannot exceed 14 billion gallons per year .
