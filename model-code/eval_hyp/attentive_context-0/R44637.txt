both the house and senate began jointly funding department of state and foreign aid appropriations within the department of state , foreign operations and related programs appropriations in the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l .
congress appropriates foreign affairs funding primarily through annual department of state , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) appropriations .
prior to fy2008 , however , congress provided funds for the department of state and international broadcasting within the commerce , justice , and state , the judiciary , and related agencies appropriations ( cjs ) and separately provided foreign aid funds within foreign operations , export financing , and related programs appropriations .
since fy2012 , congress has also appropriated overseas contingency operations ( oco ) funding requested within the regular budget process for department of state and usaid war - related expenses .
for that congress , the house of representatives appropriated state department funds separately from foreign aid , as in earlier congresses , but the senate differed by appropriating state and foreign aid funds within one bill â€” the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations .
in addition to regular , enduring sfops appropriations , congress has approved emergency supplemental funding requested by administrations to address emergency or otherwise off - cycle budget needs .
