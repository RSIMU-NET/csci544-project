to help ensure that omb , in consultation with federal financial regulators , consistently classifies dodd - frank rules as major under cra , we recommend that the director of omb , through the administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs , issue additional guidance to help standardize processes for identifying major rules under cra , including on ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies should submit rules to omb for review , such as whether agencies should submit only those rules their analyses indicate are major or all rules , and ( 2 ) how agencies should apply cra's major rule criteria in their analyses , such as whether agencies should include indirect benefits or costs , combine benefits or costs of separate but related rules , or aggregate benefits or costs for jointly issued rules .
the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) of 2010 requires federal agencies to issue hundreds of regulations to implement the act's requirements .
for example , the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) and the regulatory flexibility act ( rfa ) impose regulatory analysis requirements on federal agencies , including the federal financial regulators .
