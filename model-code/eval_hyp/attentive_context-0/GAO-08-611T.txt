as requested , my testimony today addresses ( 1 ) key findings and conclusions in our 2004 report , federal advisory committees: additional guidance could help agencies better ensure independence and balance , ( 2 ) the recommendations we made in that report to gsa and oge to address deficiencies we identified and their responses to the recommendations , and ( 3 ) potential changes to faca that could better ensure the independence and balance of advisory committees as the subcommittee considers amendments to the act .
because the effectiveness of competent federal advisory committees can be undermined if the members are , or are perceived as , lacking in independence or if committees as a whole do not appear to be properly balanced , we made 12 recommendations to gsa and oge to provide additional guidance to federal agencies under three broad categories: ( 1 ) the appropriate use of representative appointments ; ( 2 ) information that could help ensure committees are , in fact and in perception , balanced ; and ( 3 ) practices that could better ensure independent and balanced committees and increase transparency in the federal advisory process .
the office of government ethics ( oge ) is responsible for developing regulations and guidance for federal advisory committee members serving as special government employees who must meet certain federal requirements pertaining to freedom from conflicts of interest .
