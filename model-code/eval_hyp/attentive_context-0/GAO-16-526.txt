to examine the extent to which agencies are performing analysis to identify ways to better leverage their buying power , we selected six agencies that represent varying levels — high , medium and low — of purchase card spending in fiscal year 2014: the departments of defense ( dod ) , veterans affairs ( va ) , the interior ( interior ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and energy ( energy ) and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
this report addresses the extent to which selected ( 1 ) agencies analyze purchase card data to identify opportunities to leverage buying power agency - wide and ( 2 ) purchase cardholders seek opportunities to achieve cost savings when using purchase cards .
the government purchase card program was created as a way for agencies to streamline the federal acquisition process by providing a low - cost , efficient vehicle for obtaining goods and services directly from vendors .
although the general services administration ( gsa ) maintains contracts with the banks that issue the purchase cards and captures government - wide transaction data , individual agencies decide which bank to use to support its purchase card requirements and are responsible for monitoring the actions of their cardholders as well as issuing agency - specific policies and procedures on the appropriate use of purchase cards .
