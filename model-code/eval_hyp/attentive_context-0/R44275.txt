p uerto rico's financial circumstances , including uncertainty about its ability to service its large public debt , have drawn attention in recent months .
as congress examines puerto rico's finances , questions have arisen about how federal health care programs ( medicare , medicaid , and the state children's health insurance program [chip] ) and private health insurance reforms apply to puerto rico .
this report provides answers to frequently asked questions ( faqs ) about how federal health care programs and requirements are implemented in puerto rico , including eligibility , coverage , program requirements , and payment rules .
examples provided in the faqs illustrate that in many circumstances , health programs in puerto rico differ from programs in the 50 states and the district of columbia ( dc ) , while in other circumstances , puerto rico is treated the same as the states .
it then examines puerto rico's treatment under medicare , medicaid , and chip and concludes with a look at how federal requirements for private health insurance apply to puerto rico .
as such , these questions and answers should be viewed as a discussion of the complexity of health care financing as it relates to puerto rico under current law .
