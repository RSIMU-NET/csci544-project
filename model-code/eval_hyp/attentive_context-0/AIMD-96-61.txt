this report presents the results of our audits of the panama canal commission's financial statements for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 1995 and 1994 , its assertion on internal controls , and its compliance with laws and regulations .
on october 1 , 1979 , the commission was established as an executive agency to carry out the responsibilities of the united states with respect to the panama canal treaty of 1977 .
the commission will operate the canal until the treaty terminates on december 31 , 1999 , when the republic of panama will assume full responsibility for the canal .
management has implemented internal controls which , if properly implemented and adhered to , should prevent future noncompliances .
also , our opinion states that management's assertion is fairly stated that , although improvements are needed in internal controls related to the review of the classification of obligations for consultant services under congressional spending limitation , internal controls in effect on september 30 , 1995 , provided reasonable assurance that losses , noncompliance , or misstatements material to the financial statements would be prevented or detected .
in conjunction with our 1995 tests for compliance with selected provisions of certain laws and regulations , management disclosed an antideficiency act violation related to noncompliance with a congressional spending limitation .
