in my testimony today , i will summarize ( 1 ) the status of agency performance of information security control activities as reported by major agencies and their inspectors general ( ig ) , ( 2 ) the effectiveness of information security at federal agencies , and ( 3 ) opportunities to improve federal information security .
in preparing for this testimony , we analyzed the office of management and budget's ( omb ) fisma report for fiscal year 2007 and the annual fisma reports and the performance and accountability reports for 24 major federal agencies ; examined agency , ig , and our reports on information security ; and reviewed omb fisma reporting instructions , information technology ( it ) security guidance , and information on reported security incidents .
concerned by reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act ( fisma ) of 2002 , which permanently authorized and strengthened information security program , evaluation , and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies .
the need for a vigilant approach to information security is demonstrated by the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents , the wide availability of hacking tools , and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology .
