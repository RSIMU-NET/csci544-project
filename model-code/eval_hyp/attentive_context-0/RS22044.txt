the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) is a grants and civil rights statute which provides federal funding to the states to help provide education for children with disabilities .
the vagueness of the statute and the "equitable participation" standard led to differences among the states and localities and to differences among the courts .
some courts gave local authorities broad discretion to decide whether to provide services for children with disabilities in private schools which generally resulted in fewer services to such children while others attempted to equalize the costs for public and private school children .
105-17 in 1997 , states were required to set forth policies and procedures to ensure that provision was made for the participation of children with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools by their parents consistent with the number and location of these children .
if a state receives funds under idea , it must make available a free , appropriate public education ( fape ) for all children with disabilities in the state .
these requirements were further detailed in regulations which required that local education agencies ( leas ) provide private school students an opportunity for equitable participation in program benefits and that these benefits had to be "comparable in quality , scope , and opportunity for participation to the program benefits" provided to students in the public schools .
