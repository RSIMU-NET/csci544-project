we recommended that the gsa administrator ( 1 ) ensure that pre - award audits are conducted when the threshold is met for both new contract offers and contract extensions , ( 2 ) develop guidance to help contracting officers determine when postaward audits are needed , and ( 3 ) direct gsa program management to revise its quality control program to ( a ) determine the underlying causes for contract pricing deficiencies and ( b ) develop appropriate plans to implement corrective actions .
each year , federal agencies spend billions of dollars to buy commercial products and professional services through gsa's multiple award schedules program .
in fiscal year 2004 , federal agencies purchased more than $32 billion of products and services through the program .
through more than 16,000 contracts , federal agencies can directly purchase more than 8 million products from more than 10,000 commercial vendors .
consequently , gsa has less assurance that vendor - supplied pricing information is accurate , complete , and current , and its ability to deter overpricing and recover overcharges has been minimized .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the general services administration's ( gsa ) use of pre - award and postaward audits in pricing its multiple award schedules contracts .
