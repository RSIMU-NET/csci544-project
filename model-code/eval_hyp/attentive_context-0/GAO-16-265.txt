our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe the extent to which security and privacy incidents were reported for healthcare.gov or key supporting systems ; ( 2 ) assess the effectiveness of the controls implemented by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) to protect the federal data services hub ( data hub ) and the information it transmits ; ( 3 ) assess the effectiveness of cms's oversight of key program elements and controls implemented by state - based marketplaces and the effectiveness of those elements at selected state - based marketplaces to protect the information they contain .
to improve the oversight of privacy and security controls over the state - based marketplaces , we recommend that the secretary of health and human services direct the administrator of the centers for medicare & medicaid services to take the following three actions: define procedures for overseeing state - based marketplaces , to include day - to - day activities of the relevant offices and staff ; develop and document procedures for reviewing the smart tool , including specific follow - up timelines and identifying corrective actions to be performed if deficiencies are identified ; and require continuous monitoring of the privacy and security controls over state - based marketplaces and the environments in which those systems operate to more quickly identify and remediate vulnerabilities .
