all of these states have a floodplain management program that may ( 1 ) provide technical expertise to localities and individuals on complying with fema's or other federal agencies' requirements , ( 2 ) regulate local land use when localities are unable or unwilling to take needed actions to reduce the risk of flooding , or ( 3 ) coordinate local and regional floodplain management programs .
the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on water resources and environment , house committee on transportation and infrastructure , and representative william l. clay of missouri asked gao to review the extent to which ( 1 ) the corps' flood control levees prevented flooding and reduced damage during the event ; ( 2 ) these federal levees increased the height of the flooding and added to the damage ; and ( 3 ) federal , state , and local governments exercise control over the design , construction , placement , and maintenance of nonfederal levees .
the task force recommended in a july 1994 report that missouri ( 1 ) adopt a permit program for constructing and modifying levees ; ( 2 ) identify all existing levees for the purpose of developing design criteria and policy guidelines ; ( 3 ) determine the need for setbacks , relocations , and construction standards ; and ( 4 ) enact legislation that would make it easier for levee districts to form and obtain public sponsorship for participation in the corps' levee rehabilitation program .
