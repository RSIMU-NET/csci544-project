as requested , we updated our 1998 testimony to determine ( 1 ) the current combat readiness of personnel , training , and equipment in these divisions and ( 2 ) the effect of peacekeeping missions on that readiness .
to address staffing imbalances for occupational specialties common to all its divisions , we recommend that the secretary of the army develop and implement a plan to address those imbalances in making staffing decisions affecting the divisions and monitor the army's progress in alleviating the imbalances .
we agree with the army's assessment that broad transformational change , equipment modernization programs and other short - term changes to force structure will continue to challenge the army's management of soldiers in low - density and difficult - to - fill occupational fields .
though manning has improved significantly over the past 2 years , divisions still have shortages in certain combat support skills that army commanders consider critical to their wartime mission .
in 1998 we testified that personnel shortages , assignment priorities , and frequent peacekeeping deployments were degrading the combat readiness of the army's five later - deploying divisions .
it included certain measures to ensure the maintenance of adequate readiness ; for example , units are to have no fewer than 70 percent of authorized personnel .
