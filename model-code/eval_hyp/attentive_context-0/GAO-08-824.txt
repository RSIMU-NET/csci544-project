this report focuses on medicare beneficiaries' access to prescription drugs by examining: ( 1 ) the importance of assets and income in lis denials in 2006 and 2007 ; and ( 2 ) state and drug manufacturer programs providing access to prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries .
the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) created a voluntary outpatient prescription drug insurance program , known as medicare part d , that provides prescription drug coverage for over 25 million beneficiaries — seniors and individuals with disabilities — enrolled in the program .
under this program , which began in january 2006 , medicare beneficiaries can enroll in prescription drug plans run by private companies that contract with the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers the medicare program .
to qualify for the lis , applicants must meet two conditions: ( 1 ) their income and assets must be less than the thresholds established by the mma ; and ( 2 ) they must be enrolled in a part d plan .
