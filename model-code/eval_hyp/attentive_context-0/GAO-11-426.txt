to increase the transparency of the new network allocation process , and to ensure that internal control activities are performed and that the resources networks allocate to medical centers are monitored consistently and reliably , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for health to take the following two actions: require networks to provide rationales for all adjustments made to the allocation amounts proposed by the model in va's resource allocation process ; and develop written policies , consistent with federal internal control standards , to formalize existing practices for monitoring resources networks have allocated to medical centers .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) va's new process for networks to use in determining allocations to medical centers , and ( 2 ) how va centrally monitors resources networks have allocated to medical centers .
va officials said adjustment information could be used together with information from va's managerial accounting systems ( designed to help identify areas for management improvement or redesign ) to identify areas for improving the medical centers' efficiency .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) received appropriations of about $48.2 billion for health care services for fiscal year 2011 .
