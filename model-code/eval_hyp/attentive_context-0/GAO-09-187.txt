to address whether the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has effectively ( 1 ) designed controls over steps nasa identified as key to its controlled equipment reutilization process , including equipment sent to disposal , and ( 2 ) implemented policies , controls , and processes to enhance equipment reutilization , we reviewed prior nasa's office of inspector general reports and independent public accountants' reports as well as our own prior reports and related recommendations .
the implementation of its new space exploration policy — a renewed spirit of discovery: the president's vision for u.s. space exploration — and the planned retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 will require nasa to move into a period of major transition .
in response to your request , this report addresses whether nasa has effectively ( 1 ) designed controls over steps nasa identified as key to its controlled equipment reutilization process , including equipment sent to disposal , and ( 2 ) implemented policies , controls , and processes to enhance equipment reutilization .
in conducting this review , we evaluated the design of key steps in nasa's reutilization process by reviewing and comparing nasa's equipment management policies and procedural guidance for equipment management and reutilization with federal property management regulations and other property management standards , including gao's standards for internal control , and assessed key aspects of pp&e module controls ; reviewed information regarding the equipment reutilization process at five centers , interviewed relevant nasa personnel to obtain their views on the equipment reutilization process and the design and implementation of the pp&e module in facilitating equipment reutilization , and observed nasa employees as they demonstrated the pp&e module's equipment management , search , and disposal capabilities ; and selected a statistical random sample of equipment recorded in nasa's legacy nasa equipment management system ( nems ) and visited five centers to determine whether equipment recorded as actively being used was accurately recorded and transferred to the pp&e module for reuse or disposal .
