the gulf coast and the nation continue to face daunting rebuilding costs , uncertainty surrounding numerous decisions linked to the availability of federal funds , and the complexity of integrating multiple public and private decisions that will influence the future of the region .
i would like to: ( 1 ) place the federal assistance provided to date in the context of varied damage estimates for the gulf coast ; and ( 2 ) discuss the key federal programs that provide rebuilding assistance , with an emphasis on public assistance ( pa ) and community development block grants ( cdbg ) .
the bulk of federal rebuilding assistance provided to the gulf coast states funds two key programs â€” fema's public assistance ( pa ) program and hud's community development block grant ( cdbg ) program .
we also interviewed various federal officials from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and the coordinator of federal support for the recovery and rebuilding of the gulf coast region within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and analyzed federal regulations and state policies regarding funding for the gulf coast .
