our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) assess the actions cms has been taking to identify and implement it solutions for removing ssns from medicare beneficiaries' cards , and ( 2 ) determine whether cms's ongoing it modernization initiatives could offer opportunities to facilitate efforts to remove the ssn from the cards .
cms depends on more than 200 information technology ( it ) systems to support administration of the medicare program , including determination of eligibility for benefits , processing and payment of claims , and exchange of medicare - related data with external stakeholders .
to better position the agency to efficiently and cost - effectively identify , design , develop , and implement an it solution that addresses the removal of ssns from medicare beneficiaries' health insurance cards , we recommend that the administrator of cms take the following two actions: direct the initiation of an it project for identifying , developing , and implementing changes that would have to be made to cms's affected systems , including designating a business owner and establishing a business case , issuing a project charter , and conducting project selection and architectural reviews of proposed approaches for the removal of ssns from medicare beneficiaries' cards ; and incorporate such a project into plans for ongoing enterprisewide it modernization initiatives .
