specifically , we examined ( 1 ) expanded state use of the waiver program , ( 2 ) the growth in long - term care costs for individuals with developmental disabilities , ( 3 ) how costs are controlled , and ( 4 ) strengths and limitations in states' approaches to assuring quality in community settings .
adults with developmental disabilities are highly dependent on public programs for meeting their long - term care needs .
most persons with developmental disabilities have mental retardation , but others have severe , chronic disability resulting from cerebral palsy , epilepsy , or other life - long conditions , except mental illness , that began before they were 22 years old .
to conduct our work , we reviewed the literature , interviewed health care financing administration ( hcfa ) officials responsible for waiver programs and national experts , and analyzed national data on medicaid expenditures and recipients .
cost growth has been limited by two factors .
however , until states more comprehensively develop and test these approaches , some recipients may face health and safety risks and others may not have access to the range of choices state programs seek to provide .
