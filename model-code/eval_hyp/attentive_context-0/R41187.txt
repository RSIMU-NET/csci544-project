as noted above , in the early 1990s congress commissioned an independent review of the u.s. poverty measure , which culminated in a study issued by the national research council ( nrc ) of the national academy of sciences ( nas ) entitled measuring poverty: a new approach .
a second definition of poverty , closely related to the statistical definition and issued as "federal poverty guidelines" by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is used for administrative purposes , such as determining income eligibility of individuals , families , and households for federal and state programs .
a congressionally commissioned study conducted by the national academy of sciences ( nas ) national research council ( nrc ) panel provided a wide range of specific recommendations to revamp the statistical measure of poverty used in the united states in its 1995 report , measuring poverty: a new approach .
many experts and interested observers believe that the current measure of poverty is outmoded and needs to be revised to better measure social conditions and the effects of social and economic policies on the low - income population .
in arriving at its recommendations , the panel was guided by three principles: the measure should be acceptable and understandable to the public ; the measure should be statistically defensible ; and , the measure should be feasible to implement with available or readily obtainable data .
