i am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of actions by the departments of the interior ( interior ) and health and human services ( hhs ) to address issues that led to the high - risk designation we made related to the federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members .
my statement today , which is largely based on our march 2019 high - risk series: substantial efforts needed to achieve greater progress on high - risk areas , will address actions taken and progress made by these agencies to address the five criteria we use for determining whether to remove a high - risk designation ( leadership commitment , capacity , action plan , monitoring , and demonstrated progress ) .
we added this area to our high - risk list in february 2017 because of our concern about the ability of agencies within these departments to manage ( 1 ) education and health care programs that serve tribes and their members and ( 2 ) indian energy resources .
the act notes that this history of federal - tribal relations and understandings has benefitted the people of the united states and established “enduring and enforceable ederal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.” agencies can improve the efficiency of federal programs under which services are provided to tribes and their members by making improvements to their management and oversight of such programs .
