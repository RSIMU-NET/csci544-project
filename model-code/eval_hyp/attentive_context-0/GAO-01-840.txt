factors contributing to shortages include ( 1 ) units do not ask for sufficient amounts of ordnance to support their training and exercise needs ; ( 2 ) the navy has given munitions a low funding priority , which has resulted in low ordnance stockpile - levels of live munitions and shortages of inert training munitions ; and ( 3 ) the navy has poorly allocated available ordnance .

most notably , it requested less than 50 percent of its required laser - guided training rounds and less than 15 percent of its flare requirement in fiscal years 1998 to 2000 .
a well - justified training program linked to readiness would also aid in developing and supporting a procurement program that meets its needs .
