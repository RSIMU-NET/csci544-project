on july 11 , 2008 , in north carolina v. epa , the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c .
circuit vacated what was widely regarded as the bush administration's most significant environmental measure: the clean air interstate rule ( cair ) .
cair , promulgated by epa under the clean air act ( caa ) in may 2005 , established a regional cap - and - trade program for sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) and nitrogen oxide ( nox ) emissions from electric generating units ( egus ) in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia .
this left epa with three clear options: ( 1 ) starting over with a new strategy to mitigate transported air pollutants based on the decision ; ( 2 ) allowing the states to sort out the issue through section 126 petitions ; or ( 3 ) seeking new legislation providing epa with the statutory authority to either implement cair in some form , or an alternative .
so 2 emissions cause acid precipitation , and so 2 is also among the pollutants that form fine particles ( pm 2.5 ) in the atmosphere .
subsequently , on december 23 , 2008 , the court modified its decision to allow cair to remain in effect while epa fashions a replacement rule .
