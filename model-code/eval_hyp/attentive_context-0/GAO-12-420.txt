the social security administration ( ssa ) manages two of the largest federal disability benefit programs — social security disability insurance and supplemental security income — which together resulted in payments of more than $165 billion to about 13.5 million people with disabilities and their families in fiscal year 2010 .
given the extensive size and cost of its disability programs , ssa must have current and appropriate criteria by which to assess whether an applicant's medical conditions affect his or her ability to perform work in the national economy .
we were asked to assess the social security administration's ( ssa ) plans and efforts to revise its disability criteria .
to help ensure that ssa's disability decisions are as equitable and consistent with modern views of disability as possible , we recommend the commissioner of social security conduct limited and focused studies on the availability and effects of considering more fully assistive devices and workplace accommodations in its disability determinations .
moreover , we and others have found ssa's disability programs — which historically have tended to equate severity of a medical condition with an inability to work — to be out of sync with a more modern concept of disability that considers the presence or lack of assistance that an individual with medical impairments might need to function more effectively in his or her environment .
