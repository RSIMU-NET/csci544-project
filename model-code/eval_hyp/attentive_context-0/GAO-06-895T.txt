specifically , i will discuss our observations on ( 1 ) the current employment verification process and ( 2 ) ice's priorities and resources for the worksite enforcement program and the challenges it has faced in implementing that program .
the act established a two - pronged approach for helping to limit the employment of unauthorized workers: ( 1 ) an employment verification process through which employers verify all newly hired employees' work eligibility and ( 2 ) a sanctions program for fining employers who do not comply with the act .
citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) , and social security administration ( ssa ) officials in headquarters and selected field locations .
to help address this magnet , in 1986 congress passed the immigration reform and control act ( irca ) , which made it illegal for individuals and entities to knowingly hire , continue to employ , or recruit or refer for a fee unauthorized workers .
efforts to enforce these sanctions are referred to as worksite enforcement and are conducted by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) .
moreover , in previous work , we reported that employers of unauthorized aliens faced little likelihood that the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) would investigate , fine , or criminally prosecute them , a circumstance that provides little disincentive for employers who want to circumvent the law .
