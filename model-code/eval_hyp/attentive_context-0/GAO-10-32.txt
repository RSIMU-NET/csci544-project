state and local governments spend billions of dollars annually on the construction , renovation , and maintenance of public school facilities .
differences in facility condition between indian impact aid districts and other districts in washington could be attributable to these underlying selection - related differences and not to any real differences between the two populations of school districts in washington .
to determine what information is available about the physical condition of school facilities in indian impact aid school districts and what is known about how the condition of school facilities affects student outcomes , we interviewed officials from state and federal agencies , and associations and reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations .
however , concerns persist about the conditions of some school facilities , particularly those located near indian lands .

washington's data were based on evaluations from 118 of 295 school districts , including 9 of 29 indian impact aid school districts and 109 of 266 other school districts .
