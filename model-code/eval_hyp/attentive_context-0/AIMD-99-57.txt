these included program oversight ; program plans ; program - tracking mechanisms ; inventories of systems , equipment , and data exchanges ; efforts to determine how to fix systems ; and the status of renovation efforts , testing and validation plans , and contingency plans .
the successful operation of the national airspace system — the network supporting u.s. aviation operations that includes navigation facilities , airports , equipment , services , and information and rules — is dependent , in part , on the equipment , including computers , that airports use to carry out their operations .
specifically , we agreed to address the following: ( 1 ) what is the status of airports' efforts to help ensure that their computers and electronic equipment will function properly on and after january 1 , 2000 ? .
and ( 3 ) what factors affect the progress of airports' preparations for the year 2000 ? .
 ( 2 ) how will the safety , the security , and the efficiency of the national airspace system be affected if airports' year 2000 preparations are not completed in time ? .
because of the interdependence among airline flights and airport facilities , decreased efficiency and delays at one airport could cause delays at other airports and eventually impede the flow of air traffic throughout the nation , especially if those delays occur at airports that serve as hubs .
