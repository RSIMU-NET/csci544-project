in response to your request , this report discusses ( 1 ) the lessons that can be learned from efforts by nonfederal land managers to generate revenue and / or become financially self - sufficient from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands and ( 2 ) legal and other barriers that may preclude the forest service from implementing similar efforts on its lands .
rather than applying a one - size - fits - all approach or technique , the managers have ( 1 ) usually tailored their efforts to meet either a clear mission to make a profit over time or an incentive to generate revenue for other mission - related goals and objectives and ( 2 ) often been delegated the discretion and flexibility to make choices while being held accountable for their expenditures and results .
because the forest service has not exercised its authority to obtain fair market value for certain goods and to recover costs for certain services and has not always acted to contain costs , even when requested to do so by the congress , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture direct the chief of the forest service to revise the strategic plan that the agency developed to comply with the requirements of the results act to include goals and performance measures for obtaining fair market value for goods , recovering costs for services , and containing expenses as the necessary first step in holding the forest service accountable for its performance .
