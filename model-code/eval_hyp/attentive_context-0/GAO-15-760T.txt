my testimony summarizes the findings from our report issued in march of this year , which had two objectives: ( 1 ) to review usaid's processes for awarding and modifying cash - based food assistance projects and ( 2 ) to assess the extent to which usaid and its implementing partners have implemented financial controls to help ensure appropriate oversight of such projects .
to address these objectives , we analyzed data and reviewed program documents provided by usaid and its implementing partners , including the united nations ( un ) food and agriculture organization ( fao ) , the un world food programme ( wfp ) , and selected nongovernmental organizations ( ngo ) .
given that ffp's cash - based projects are to monitor market conditions to detect significant changes that may warrant project modifications , we also analyzed price data for key staple commodities in selected markets in four case study countries: jordan , to assess the extent to which usaid and kenya , niger , and somalia.the implementing partners implemented financial controls , we reviewed documentation and reports related to the cash and voucher distributions in our case study countries , and assessed the controls they have designed and implemented against their policies , procedures , guidance ; federal internal control standards ; and international principles and guidelines .
