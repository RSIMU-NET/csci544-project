epa's ability to effectively carry out its mission to protect human health and the environment is critically dependent on timely and credible scientific and technical information and health risk assessments .
since 2001 , we have issued a number of reports underscoring the importance of integrity and transparency in processes that ( 1 ) develop the science used to inform policy decisions and ( 2 ) are used to establish federal advisory committees that , among other things , provide independent peer reviews of epa's scientific determinations .
notably , our work on epa's integrated risk information system ( iris ) program and its database — which contains the agency's scientific position on the potential human health effects of exposure to more than 540 chemicals — identified significant concerns about both the lack of transparency in the process epa uses to assess toxic chemicals and the resulting effect on the credibility , or integrity , of these assessments .
following are highlights of the recommendations in our 2004 report , federal advisory committees: additional guidance could help agencies better ensure independence and balance , to the general services administration ( gsa ) and the office of government ethics ( oge ) .
