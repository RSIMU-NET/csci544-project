enrollment nationwide in the medicare managed care program has more than tripled in the last decade — growing from about 1 million enrollees in 1987 to about 3.8 million in 1996 — but differences in enrollment by state and by market area are striking .
in some metropolitan areas like portland , oregon , and tucson , arizona , the dominant form of medicare managed care — the health maintenance organization ( hmo ) — has enrolled more than 40 percent of the medicare beneficiaries .
to explore this issue further , you asked us to identify patterns in hmo enrollment and medicare payment rates , and examine selected geographical areas — in particular , some with higher enrollment / lower payment rates and some with lower enrollment / higher payment rates — and describe how the presence or absence of certain factors could affect enrollment .
to identify where beneficiaries were enrolled in hmos and the rates that medicare paid to hmos , we used data obtained from the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) office of managed care .
although such large disparities are sometimes attributed to areas' medicare payment rates for hmos , studies have identified this as only one of several influences at work .
