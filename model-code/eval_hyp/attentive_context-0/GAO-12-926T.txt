to improve coordination among regulators and help congress better assess the effectiveness of the voluntary smart grid standards process , we recommended that the chairman of ferc develop an approach to coordinate with state regulators and with groups that represent utilities subject to less ferc and state regulation to ( 1 ) periodically evaluate the extent to which utilities and manufacturers are following voluntary interoperability and cybersecurity standards and ( 2 ) develop strategies for addressing any gaps in compliance with standards that are identified as a result of this evaluation .
in my testimony today , i will describe ( 1 ) cyber threats facing cyber - reliant critical infrastructures , which include the electricity grid , and ( 2 ) actions taken and challenges remaining to secure the grid against cyber attacks .
in addition , since 2003 we have identified protecting systems supporting our nation's critical infrastructure ( which includes the electricity grid ) as a governmentwide high - risk area , and we continue to do so in the most recent update to our high - risk list .
along with these anticipated benefits , however , cybersecurity and industry experts have expressed concern that , if not implemented securely , modernized electricity grid systems will be vulnerable to attacks that could result in widespread loss of electrical services essential to maintaining our national economy and security .
