fannie mae and freddie mac are government - sponsored enterprises ( gses ) that have played a central role in mortgage finance .
to revoke fannie and freddie's charters and fully privatize the two firms would require an act of congress .
the options involve tradeoffs among four factors: improving access to mortgage credit ( which may expose the government to risk ) ; providing incentives for housing investment ( which may divert resources from other productive uses ) ; protecting taxpayer from loss ( which may conflict with the two factors above ) ; and financial and economic stability ( government responses to crises may create moral hazard and encourage excessive private risk taking ) .
they provide a secondary market for home mortgages â€” buying mortgages from the original lenders , packaging them into bonds backed by homeowners' interest and principal payments ( a process known as "securitization" ) , and selling these mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) to bond investors with a guarantee that interest and principal will be paid on time .
currently , the value of mortgages purchased , securitized , and guaranteed by fannie and freddie exceeds $5 trillion , about half of all u.s. single - family residential mortgages .
