a few weeks before , merck had notified the food and drug administration ( fda ) that it was withdrawing vioxx from the market in response to recent study results indicating an increased risk of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths among the millions of patients who had been using vioxx since its introduction in 1999 .
it could also examine how fda can better use the legal — and moral — authority it already has ( 1 ) to encourage and participate in developing , gathering , analyzing , and disseminating information ; ( 2 ) to act on that information when necessary ; and ( 3 ) by its powers to both offer incentives and enforce penalties — and by its own example — to encourage industry cooperation .
the agency most responsible for such issues is the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
with that money , fda was expected to oversee about $1 trillion of goods , which make up about one - quarter of all u.s. consumer spending .
there has not been a decade since fda's creation without a highly publicized incident involving drug safety that has led to legislation expanding and strengthening fda's authority to protect the public .
