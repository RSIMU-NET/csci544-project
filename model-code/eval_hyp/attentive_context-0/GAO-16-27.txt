section 821 ( e ) of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included a provision for us to report on the results of the department of defense's test program for negotiation of comprehensive small business subcontracting plans ( test program ) .
this report addresses the extent to which the test program ( 1 ) reduces administrative costs , and ( 2 ) enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses .
despite the 25- year tenure of the test program , little is publicly known about its results , as the department of defense ( dod ) has not published any reports on its performance .
to address whether the test program reduces administrative costs , we analyzed dod - commissioned reviews of the program performed in 2002 , 2007 , and 2013 ; each of which included estimates of the cost savings or avoidance associated with the program .
this report addresses the extent to which the test program ( 1 ) reduces administrative costs , and ( 2 ) enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses .
although the test program's initial performance period was 3 years , congress has extended its duration eight times , with the most recent extension scheduled to end december 31 , 2017 .
