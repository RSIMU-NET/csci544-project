such actions should include establishing recurring processes to ( 1 ) share information about non - dod federal agencies seeking workspace , and ( 2 ) ensure that gsa and dod organizations are aware of the appropriate points of contacts within their organizations at the regional and local levels .
without such information sharing , dod may be missing opportunities for installations to maximize the use of space and reduce costs , and gsa risks missing opportunities for some of its clients to reduce or avoid rental costs altogether and to reduce their reliance on commercial leases .
to evaluate the potential for and obstacles to federal agencies other than department of defense ( dod ) organizations relocating onto military installations to save costs and enhance security , this report identifies ( 1 ) what options , if any , are available for dod to allow non - dod entities , including federal government agencies , to use unutilized ( vacant ) and underutilized ( partially vacant ) space on military installations , and what factors dod considers when considering exercising each option ; ( 2 ) any limitations and benefits of bringing non - dod federal agencies onto installations ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which dod and other federal agencies coordinate to do so .
