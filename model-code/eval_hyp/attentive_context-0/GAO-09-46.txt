specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the status of hud's current efforts to promote energy efficiency and the performance measures the agency uses to assess these efforts ; ( 2 ) the potential costs and long - term benefits of incorporating green building practices into hud's affordable housing programs ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned elsewhere that hud could apply to promoting green building practices in its programs .
in order to better promote green building practices , we recommend that the secretary of hud direct the appropriate program offices to take the following actions: ensure completion of the regulation that would require the use of energy - efficient products and appliances for public housing as directed by the energy policy act of 2005 , proactively work with doe to expeditiously implement energy - efficiency updates to the hud manufactured housing code , ensure that updates to handbooks are regularly completed in a timely fashion to provide more current guidance on energy - efficient and other green building practices , consider working with doe's oak ridge national laboratory and epa to develop a utility benchmarking tool for multifamily properties , and assess whether the single - point incentive awarded for energy efficiency is sufficient to stimulate higher levels of energy efficiency for its competitive grant programs and consider providing nonenergy green building incentive points for these programs .
