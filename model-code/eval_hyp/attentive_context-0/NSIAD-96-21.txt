other reasons cited for a contractor not making a voluntary disclosure include ( 1 ) contractor management conflicts between disclosing potential fraud to the government and the contractor's perceived duty to protect stockholder value ; ( 2 ) contractor uncertainty of prosecution outcome from disclosing potential fraud ; ( 3 ) the high cost of internal investigations , which is usually stipulated to be an unallowable cost for government reimbursement purposes ; and ( 4 ) differences between contractor disclosure policies and its practices .
more specifically , this report provides information and observations on ( 1 ) the extent of defense contractor participation in the program , ( 2 ) the amount of money that has been recovered , ( 3 ) the time taken to close cases , ( 4 ) the most common type of disclosures , and ( 5 ) the extent of overlap between voluntary disclosures and qui tam actions .
in response to your request , we developed information on the department of defense's ( dod ) voluntary disclosure program , a program to encourage defense contractors to voluntarily disclose potential civil or criminal procurement fraud to the government .
dod and department of justice policies and practices , along with statutory and court restrictions , precluded our access to many individual case files , negating our ability to fully evaluate the program .
