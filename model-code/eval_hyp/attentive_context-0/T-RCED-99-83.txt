my testimony today , which is based on gao's recently completed and ongoing work at the coast guard , addresses three topics: ( 1 ) the coast guard's progress in justifying the deepwater replacement project and addressing our concerns about its affordability , ( 2 ) the coast guard's plans for spending its fiscal year 1999 emergency funds , and ( 3 ) the budget strategies the agency may have to consider in the future to address continuing budget constraints .
as directed by the congress , it has begun buying more patrol boats ; reactivating its surveillance aircraft and ships ; and obtaining additional equipment , such as sensors and communications systems , to improve its ability to detect drug smugglers and to coordinate its anti - drug activities .
the program , called the deepwater replacement project , may cost as much as $9.8 billion ( in constant 1998 dollars ) over the next 20 years and is potentially the largest acquisition project in the agency's history .
this increased the coast guard's total fiscal year 1999 funding to about $4.3 billion .
during the last 2 years , we have issued reports on the overall fiscal challenges facing the coast guard and the justification and the affordability associated with its multi - billion dollar program for replacing or modernizing many of its ships and aircraft .
