s. 1000 is intended to advance this framework and the implementation of telework programs and to increase the eligibility of federal employees for telework as well as its use .
this framework has included provisions directed at increasing employee eligibility for telework , requiring reporting and evaluation of telework implementation , establishing agency telework coordinators to lead the program , setting goals for the application of telework provisions to the federal workforce , and even withholding funds from some agencies that fail to show progress .
congress has demonstrated its keen interest in promoting the use of telework in the federal government by establishing a wide - ranging statutory framework .
among those were several practices closely aligned with managing for program results , including: developing a business case for implementing a telework program ; establishing measurable telework program goals ; establishing processes , procedures , and / or a tracking system to collect data to evaluate the telework program ; and identifying problems and / or issues with the telework program and making appropriate adjustments .
telework is a human capital strategy which offers flexibilities to both employers and employees .
it is increasingly recognized as an important means to achieving a number of federal efforts , including effective strategic human capital management of the federal workforce , and a greater capability to continue operations during emergency events , as well as affording environmental , energy , and other benefits to society .
