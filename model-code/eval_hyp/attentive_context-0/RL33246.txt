the reading first program was authorized as part of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) through the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ) .
the nclba was signed into law on january 8 , 2002 , and will expire at the end of fy2008 ( including the automatic general education provisions act one - year extension ) .
it is expected that the 110 th congress will consider legislation to extend the authorization of the esea as amended by the nclba .
the reading first program includes both formula grants ( states are allocated funds in proportion to the estimated number of children , aged 5 to 17 , who reside within the state from families with incomes below the poverty line ) and targeted assistance grants to states .
the nclba included three new reading programs: reading first , early reading first , and improving literacy through school libraries .
in addition , it recommended that congress adopt new requirements regarding financial disclosure to prevent future conflicts of interest by federal employees and others involved in the administration or implementation of k - 12 education programs , as well as those providing technical assistance .
