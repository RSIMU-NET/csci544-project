because of your continuing interest in the effective use of food safety resources , i will focus on three key points: ( 1 ) the role of gao's high - risk series in raising the priority and visibility of the need to transform federal oversight of food safety , ( 2 ) the fragmented nature of federal oversight of food safety , and ( 3 ) the need to address federal oversight of food safety as a 21st century challenge .
with 15 agencies collectively administering at least 30 laws related to food safety , the patchwork nature of the federal food safety oversight system calls into question whether the government can more efficiently and effectively protect our nation's food supply .
our high - risk status reports are provided at the start of each new congress to help in setting congressional oversight agendas and to help in raising the priority and visibility of government programs needing transformation .
these reports also help congress and the executive branch carry out their responsibilities while improving the government's performance and enhancing its accountability for the benefit of the american people .
together , the high - risk update and the recommendations for oversight can help congressional decision makers focus on the programmatic challenges facing the nation .
