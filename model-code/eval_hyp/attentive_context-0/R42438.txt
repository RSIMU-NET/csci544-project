depending on the conduct of the election , the official election results , and the treatment of the newly elected members of parliament , u.s. policy toward burma may undergo a major shift , possibly including the waiver or removal of some of the current u.s. sanctions .
the republic of the union of myanmar ( burma ) held parliamentary by - elections on april 1 , 2012 .
other nations and the european union ( eu ) are reportedly also considering removing sanctions or restrictions on burma depending on their assessments of the by - elections .
burma's parliamentary system consists of the bicameral union parliament ( pyidaungsu hluttaw ) plus separate local parliaments for each of the nation's seven states and seven regions .
during the period prior to and after the by - elections , congress may decide to conduct hearings and undertake other forms of investigation into the situation in burma in preparation for its response to a request from the obama administration .
the two chambers of the union parliament are the lower house people's assembly ( pyithu hluttaw ) with 440 seats , and the upper house national assembly ( amyotha hluttaw ) with 224 seats .
