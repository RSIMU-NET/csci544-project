among the actions dod has taken to accomplish these goals in afghanistan , iraq , and syria is that of increasing its reliance on: ( 1 ) partner nation security forces ; ( 2 ) u.s. and coalition airpower ; ( 3 ) special operations forces ; and ( 4 ) contractor and temporary duty personnel .
under joint doctrine , the joint operational planning process consists of a set of logical steps to examine the mission ; develop , analyze , and compare courses of action ; select the best course of action ; and produce a plan or order .
for iraq and syria , the lead inspector general for overseas contingency operations reported that , as part of operation inherent resolve , the united states authorized an additional 615 troops in september 2016 , bringing the total authorized forces in support of that operation to 5,262. , while force management levels have long been used as a policy tool to shape and direct the deployment of u.s. military forces , they can present a unique challenge to military planners .
although force management levels may be part of the input as plans are developed , and may be taken into account as existing plans are assessed and updated , they may also have the effect of essentially reversing the planning order and establishing resource limits that dod planners and commanders need to adjust to or work around as they develop and execute their plans .
