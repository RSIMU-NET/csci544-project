despite international naval efforts to counter acts of piracy in the waters off somalia , pirates in this region continue to increase not only the sophistication and geographic range of their attacks , but also the level of violence against hostages .
pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , the red sea , and the waters far off somalia's eastern coast , including the arabian sea , have been attributed to somali pirates .
as of march 2011 , somali pirates had been sighted as far east as off the coast of india , and as far south as the mozambique channel .
heightened military presence in an internationally recommended transit corridor in the gulf of aden has reduced attacks in that area , but pirates have adopted tactics that now allow them to attack more than 1,000 nautical miles off the somali coast .
hostages are also being detained longer , as pirates hold out for ransom payments that now reportedly average over $5 million per ship .
attacks east and south of somalia , however , increased substantially , up from 19 reported attacks in 2008 and 80 in 2009 to over 140 in 2010 .
