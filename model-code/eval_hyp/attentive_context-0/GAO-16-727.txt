government procurement constitutes a significant potential market for international trade , with an estimated annual global size of $4.4 trillion , and the united states has played a key role in developing trade agreements that partially open government procurement markets , which are often closed to foreign competition , according to officials from the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) .
specifically , the united states and other countries have made commitments under the world trade organization's ( wto ) agreement on government procurement ( gpa ) and under u.s. free trade agreements ( fta ) that open government procurement to foreign suppliers , ensure that the process is conducted transparently and without bias , and provide foreign suppliers with the same rights as domestic ones .
this scope encompasses six agreements: ( 1 ) the 1994 gpa and the revised gpa , ( 2 ) the government procurement chapters of ftas covering the top five fta partner countries ( the north american free trade agreement , ( 3 ) the south korea - fta , ( 4 ) the colombia - fta , and ( 5 ) the australia - fta ) .
