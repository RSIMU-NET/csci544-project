congress has been closely involved in formulating u.s. policy on surplus plutonium disposition , as well as funding the necessary facilities , operations , and russian assistance to implement the program .
with the end of the cold war and breakup of the soviet union in the early 1990s , control of surplus nuclear weapons material became an urgent u.s. foreign policy goal .
because of sharply rising cost estimates for plutonium disposition facilities under construction in south carolina , the obama administration proposed in its fy2017 budget request to end construction and pursue a "dilute and dispose" ( d&d ) option .
the plutonium disposition program , including u.s. assistance for the russian program , is administered by the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a semiautonomous agency of the department of energy ( doe ) .
in september 1998 , the united states and russia each agreed to convert 34 metric tons of surplus weapons - grade plutonium to a form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons under the plutonium management and disposition agreement ( pmda ) .
particular u.s. concern focused on plutonium from soviet nuclear warheads , which it was feared posed a major nuclear weap ons proliferation risk .
