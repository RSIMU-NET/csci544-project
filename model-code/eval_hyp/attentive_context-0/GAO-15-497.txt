the federal government's transit benefit program was established in 1993 and was intended to expand federal employees' use of public transportation by providing transit vouchers and passes for public transit as a qualified transportation fringe benefit .
in fiscal year 2014,106 federal entities entered into interagency agreements on a fee - for - service basis with the department of transportation's ( dot ) office of transportation services ( transerve ) to distribute about $210 million in transit benefits to their employees .
this report describes the extent to which dot has ( 1 ) designed internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that federal employees do not use the transerve debit card to make non - transit - related purchases and ( 2 ) worked with irs to ensure its debit - card program met requirements for excludable qualified transportation fringe benefits in relevant statutes , treasury regulations , and irs administrative rules .
to identify transerve's internal - control processes and practices for identifying and denying non - transit - related purchases , we reviewed transerve program guidance and methods for reviewing debit card transactions ; reporting on potential misuse of the card ; and communicating with federal entity clients .
