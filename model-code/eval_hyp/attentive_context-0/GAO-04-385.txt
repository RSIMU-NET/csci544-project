the security of our nation's commercial aviation system has been a long - standing concern , and for over 30 years , substantial efforts have been undertaken to strengthen it .
tsa plans to provide oversight of capps ii through two methods: ( 1 ) establishing goals and measures to assess the program's strengths , weaknesses , and performance ; and ( 2 ) establishing mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the use and operation of the system .
however , the tragic events of september 11 , 2001 — which began with the hijacking of four commercial aircraft — showed that weaknesses in commercial aviation security continued to exist .
in addition , tsa has not fully established or documented additional oversight controls to ensure that operations are effectively monitored and evaluated .
many changes have since been made to strengthen aviation security and reduce opportunities for terrorists to hijack or destroy commercial aircraft .
tsa has not fully addressed seven of the eight issues identified by the congress as key areas of interest related to the development and implementation of capps ii .
however , tsa has not yet developed a complete mitigation strategy to address this risk .
