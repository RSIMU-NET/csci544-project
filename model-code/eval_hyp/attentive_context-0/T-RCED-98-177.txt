concerned about how well this title i program was being operated , you and congressman bentsen asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the information needed to manage the program was available to hud , ( 2 ) the extent to which hud was overseeing program lenders , and ( 3 ) whether hud has any ongoing or planned efforts under way to strengthen its management and oversight .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss the preliminary results of our assessment of certain aspects of the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) management and oversight of its loan insurance program for home improvements under title i of the national housing act .
these loans are made by banks and other private lenders from their own funds and are insured by hud's federal housing administration ( fha ) .
if borrowers default on their loans , banks submit claims to hud , which approves or denies them .
hud also provides limited oversight of lenders' compliance with program regulations , conducting only 2 on - site lender reviews in fiscal year 1997 of the approximately 3,700 program lenders .
