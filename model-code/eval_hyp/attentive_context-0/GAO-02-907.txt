the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , which administers u.s. patent and trademark laws , had a staff of 6,426 and collected about $1.1 billion in patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2001 .
in this context , you asked for information on ( 1 ) uspto's past and future operations , particularly patent applications filed , patents granted , patent application inventory , patent pendency , patent examiner staffing , and fee collections and funding requirements ( agency appropriations ) ; ( 2 ) some of the differences between uspto's business and strategic plans ; and ( 3 ) changes in the patent fee structure under proposed legislation .
additionally , the strategic plan's success was linked to enactment of the president's fiscal year 2003 budget , legislation to change uspto's current fee schedule , revisions to current rules , and legislation for streamlining the patent and trademark system .
historically , the time from the date that a patent application is filed to the date that either the patent is granted or the application is abandoned has been called “patent pendency.” in april 2001 , uspto estimated in its fiscal year 2002 corporate plan — which was part of the agency's fiscal year 2002 budget submission and included some performance information covering fiscal years 2002 through 2006 — that patent pendency would increase from 25 months in fiscal year 2000 to over 38 months in fiscal year 2006 .
