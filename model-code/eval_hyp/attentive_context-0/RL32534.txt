relations between belarus and the united states have been particularly poor since lukashenko's brutal repression of the opposition after fraudulent presidential elections in december 2010 .
belarusian president aleksandr lukashenko snuffed out belarus's modest progress toward democracy and a free market economy and created an authoritarian regime shortly after being elected as president in 1994 .
another concern is belarus's support for pariah regimes , including through arms sales .
in response , the eu and united states have imposed strengthened sanctions against key belarusian leaders , businessmen , and firms .
the opposition's weakness is in part due to the regime's repression , but divisions over ideology and the conflicting personal ambitions of its leaders have also been factors .
according to monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) , the elections failed to meet international standards for free and fair elections .
russia has taken advantage of this situation to increase its political and economic influence in belarus .
the regime forced the closure of independent media and non - governmental organizations ( ngos ) dealing with political issues and human rights .
those advocating a stronger u.s. role in trying to bring democratic change to belarus say that the country is important to the united states because belarus is an obstacle to the u.s. goal of making europe "whole and free. .
