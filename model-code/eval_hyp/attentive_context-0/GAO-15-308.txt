in this report , we evaluated program progress towards ( 1 ) achieving cost and performance goals ; ( 2 ) meeting schedule targets ; and ( 3 ) obtaining critical manufacturing knowledge prior to the low - rate production decision .
this knowledge is based on practices we identified in previous work that are used by leading commercial companies , including ( 1 ) identifying key system characteristics and critical manufacturing processes ; ( 2 ) establishing a reliability growth plan and goals ; ( 3 ) conducting failure modes and effects analysis ; ( 4 ) conducting reliability growth testing ; ( 5 ) determining whether processes are in control and capable ; and ( 6 ) testing a production - representative prototype in its intended environment .
in our three previous reports , we made recommendations to the department of defense ( dod ) to improve the program , and dod has addressed some of them .
that analysis has not yet been completed .
appendix i: status of prior gao recommendations gao report recommendation gao - 12-366 dod should ( 1 ) closely monitor the cost , schedule , and performance outcomes of the kc - 46 program to identify positive or negative lessons learned and ( 2 ) develop metrics to track achievement of key performance parameters .
