my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) medicare payment policies to cover part b - covered drug costs and costs of administering the drugs and ( 2 ) key features of other payers' reimbursement policies that suggest opportunities to improve the appropriateness of medicare's payments .
in september 2000 , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) — now the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) — took steps to reduce medicare's payment for part b - covered drugs by authorizing medicare carriers , the contractors that pay part b claims , to use prices obtained in the justice department investigations of providers' drug acquisition costs .
in december 2000 , as part of recent medicare legislation , the congress asked us to study medicare's payments for part b - covered drugs and make recommendations for pricing methodology refinements .
studies by the department of justice , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of the inspector general ( oig ) , and the house committee on commerce show that medicare's payment for these drugs in some cases is significantly higher than the actual costs to the physicians and other providers who bill medicare for these products .
