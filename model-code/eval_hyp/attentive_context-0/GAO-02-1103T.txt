my testimony today will focus on ( 1 ) the benefits nonprofit research corporations provide to va , ( 2 ) processes to detect individual and institutional conflicts of interest within nonprofit research corporations , and ( 3 ) nonprofit research corporations' financial activities and how they are monitored by va. to conduct our work , we visited 5 of the 88 nonprofit corporations based on their dollar revenues for 2000 .
in fiscal year 2000 , these corporations administered funds amounting to $174 million , or about 15 percent of va's total medical research dollars .
for example , the va inspector general's last major review of the program occurred in 1994 , when va was cited for failing to provide adequate policies and guidance relating to budgeting , accounting , and oversight of these corporations .
since va's nonprofit corporations were first established , there has been limited oversight of their operations and contributions to va research .
we compared and analyzed data from each of the five nonprofit research corporations' audited financial statements to their internal revenue service ( irs ) tax forms for 2000 and 2001 , along with general ledger account balances and supporting documentation for revenues and expenses .
