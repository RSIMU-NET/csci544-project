since april 2003 , congress has appropriated more than $20 billion to support rebuilding efforts such as restoring iraq's oil and electric infrastructures ; reconstituting iraq's national army and local police forces ; assisting in developing a market - based economy ; and improving the country's health , education , and medical services .
address and resolve all outstanding issues in connection with the pending justifications and approvals for the contracts and related task orders used by the army corps of engineers to restore iraq's electricity infrastructure .
staffing constraints and security concerns posed further challenges .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine whether agencies had complied with applicable laws and regulations governing competition in awarding new contracts and issuing task orders under existing contracts , and ( 2 ) evaluate agencies' initial efforts in carrying out contract administration tasks .
our review focused on reconstruction - related contract actions by the department of defense ( dod ) ( primarily the u.s. army , including the army corps of engineers ) , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the department of state through september 30 , 2003 .
