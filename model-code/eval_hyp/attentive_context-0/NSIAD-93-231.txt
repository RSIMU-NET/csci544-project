tradoc's lessons learned program has two primary weaknesses that hamper its effectiveness .
absent such procedures , tradoc has limited knowledge as to whether and to what extent the lessons are being used to resolve the problems identified by the center for army lessons learned .
these problems are in such areas as battlefield planning ; development and use of intelligence data , reconnaissance , and communications ; performance under chemical threats ; and integration of effective fire support into unit mission planning .
furthermore , officials said that some deficiencies will never be eliminated entirely because ( 1 ) the army is continuously training new soldiers and it is reasonable to expect them to make mistakes as they learn their profession and ( 2 ) some tasks are particularly complex and difficult to master .
more specifically , it said that the guidance would direct tradoc to establish ( 1 ) a system to assign priorities to the problems identified at the combat training centers and ( 2 ) procedures for tracking lessons learned and assigning accountability for problem resolution .
we believe that another contributing factor may have been the combined arms command's failure to adequately monitor the plan's implementation .
