in this context of both the increasing size and severity of wildland fires and the rising costs of suppressing fires and protecting federal and nonfederal lands and resources , you asked us to ( 1 ) review how federal and nonfederal entities share the costs of suppressing wildland fires that burn or threaten both of their lands and resources and ( 2 ) identify any concerns federal and nonfederal entities may have with the existing cost - sharing framework .
although wildland fires triggered by lightning are a natural , inevitable , and necessary ecological process , past federal fire suppression policies have led to an accumulation of fuels and contributed to larger and more severe wildland fires .
since 2000 , federal suppression expenditures alone have averaged more than $1 billion annually .
in addition , as human development continues to expand in or near wildlands — an area commonly known as the wildland - urban interface — wildland fires increasingly threaten not only federal lands and public resources , such as forests and watersheds , but also nonfederal lands and resources , including homes and other structures .
to strengthen the framework for sharing wildland fire suppression costs , we recommend that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior , working in conjunction with relevant state entities , take the following two actions: provide more specific guidance as to when particular cost - sharing methods should be used and clarify the financial responsibilities for suppressing fires that burn , or threaten to burn , across multiple jurisdictions .
