federal rulemaking is one of the crucial methods through which public policy is established and implemented in the united states .
to structure the ways in which agencies issue regulations pursuant to their delegated authority , congress has created a statutory scheme of procedural controls .
using that delegated authority , agencies issue regulations to implement those statutes and set the details of public policy .
under the constitutional separation of powers system , congress enacts statutes th at often delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies .
the most significant of these controls is the administrative procedure act ( apa ) of 1946 , which generally requires agencies to issue a proposed rule and take public comment prior to issuing a final rule .
congress designed these basic stepsâwhich create the backbone of the federal rulemaking processâto allow for public input into federal agencies' policymaking decisions .
for example , the center for effective government suggested that a petition for rulemaking should include information such as an explanation of the proposed action ; the language the petitioner would like to propose for a new or amended rule or eliminate from a rule ; information and arguments that support the petitioner's proposed action , including relevant technical and scientific data ; specific facts or circumstances that support the proposed action ; and relevant legal information about any specific laws or statutory provisions that is relevant to the petition and the rule in question .
