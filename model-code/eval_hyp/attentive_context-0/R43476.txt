the slow decline in the unemployment rate and continued lack of employment opportunities for youth and the long - term unemployed in the current recovery have raised concerns that the natural rate of unemployment may have risen recently .
the unemployment rate declined markedly in 2013 , to 6.7% in december from 7.9% in january , seeming to signal that the labor market is approaching full employment .
for example , the decline in the unemployment rate was caused in part by workers dropping out of the labor force .
but borrowing has long - term economic costs and inter - generational equity implications , and the benefits of fiscal stimulus decline as the economy approaches full employment .
congress is directly responsible for fiscal policy through its control of federal revenue and spending provisions .
it reviews studies that have sought to determine how much of the decline in the labor force participation rate is caused by the recession and how much is caused by structural factors , such as the aging of the labor force .
were the recent pace of improvement in the unemployment rate to continue , unemployment could fall to the natural rate in the next year or two .
