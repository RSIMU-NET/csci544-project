thank you for the opportunity to discuss issues associated with the federal emergency management agency's ( fema ) , an agency within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and its efforts to address the shortcomings of the preparation and response to hurricane katrina and enhance its capabilities for responding to major disasters , including hurricanes .
my testimony today ( 1 ) summarizes our key findings on leadership , response capabilities , and accountability controls and the efforts made by dhs and fema in their implementation of the post - katrina reform act and other recommendations made in the aftermath of hurricane katrina , and ( 2 ) highlights several disaster management issues for continued congressional attention .
as the comptroller general testified in february 2007 on dhs's high - risk status and specifically disaster preparedness and response , dhs must overcome continuing challenges , including those related to clearly defining leadership roles and responsibilities , developing necessary disaster response capabilities , and establishing accountability systems to provide effective services while protecting against waste , fraud , and abuse .
the goal of disaster preparedness and response is easy to state but difficult to achieve and can be stated as follows: to prevent where possible , prepare for , mitigate , and respond to disasters of any size or cause with well - planned , well - coordinated , and effective actions that minimize the loss of life and property and set the stage for a quick recovery .
