in 2005 , medicare — the federal program that helps pay for physician and other health care services furnished to the nation's elderly and disabled — paid over $1.4 billion for anesthesia services , which are services associated with the administration of anesthesia to patients undergoing surgical or other invasive procedures .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) the extent to which medicare payments for anesthesia services were lower than private payments across medicare payment localities in 2004 , ( 2 ) whether the supply of anesthesia practitioners across medicare payment localities in 2004 was related to the differences between medicare and private payments for anesthesia services or to the concentration of medicare beneficiaries in these localities , and ( 3 ) compensation levels for anesthesia practitioners compared to other health care practitioners in 2005 and trends in the number of anesthesiology residency positions and the number of graduates of nurse anesthesia programs .
to determine whether the supply of anesthesia practitioners was related to the concentration of medicare beneficiaries , we examined the correlation between the supply of anesthesia practitioners and the concentration of medicare beneficiaries in the general population across 87 of medicare's payment localities and determined whether they were statistically significant .
