as you are aware , fps — within the national protection and programs directorate ( nppd ) of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — is responsible for protecting the buildings , grounds , and property that are under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) , as well as the persons on the property ; authorized to enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting gsa buildings and persons on the property ; and authorized to investigate offenses against these buildings and persons .
thus , in our report we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the under secretary of nppd and the director of fps to take the following eight actions: identify other approaches and options that would be most beneficial and financially feasible for protecting federal buildings ; rigorously and consistently monitor guard contractors' and guards' performance and step up enforcement against contractors that are not complying with the terms of the contract ; complete all contract performance evaluations in accordance with fps and federal acquisition regulation requirements ; issue a standardized record - keeping format to ensure that contract files have required documentation ; develop a mechanism to routinely monitor guards at federal facilities provide building - specific and scenario - based training and guidance to its develop and implement a management tool for ensuring that reliable , comprehensive data on the contract guard program are available on a real - time basis ; and verify the accuracy of all guard certification and training data before entering them into ramp , and periodically test the accuracy and reliability of ramp data to ensure that fps management has the information needed to effectively oversee its guard program .
