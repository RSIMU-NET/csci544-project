to promote work rather than welfare dependence and to provide states more flexibility in designing their welfare programs , the new welfare reform law made a number of changes to the nation's cash assistance programs , including aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
in light of the potential for significant change and your interest in determining what medicaid - related actions states have taken in the first year of welfare reform , you asked us to briefly describe the medicaid - related options the welfare reform law gave states and discuss the approaches states have chosen ; identify the implications of these state choices for medicaid eligibles and for the states' administrative processes ; and identify steps states have taken or plan to take to educate and enroll medicaid eligibles , in view of their changing eligibility for cash assistance programs .
states can use their federally set allotments to ( 1 ) expand their existing medicaid programs to include children who do not qualify under the state's march 31 , 1997 , medicaid rules ; ( 2 ) create or expand a separate children's health insurance program ; or ( 3 ) use a combination of medicaid and state children's health insurance program funds to increase health coverage for children .
