i will focus my remarks today on several key management and budget issues at epa , including ( 1 ) management of epa's workload , workforce , and real property ; ( 2 ) coordination with other agencies to more effectively leverage limited resources ; and ( 3 ) observations on the agency's budget justifications .
epa has generally agreed with our recommendations .
the four major categories of epa spending in fiscal year 2010 were: operating budget ( $3.9 billion ) for basic regulatory , research , and enforcement activities ; infrastructure grants ( $3.9 billion ) providing financial assistance to states , municipalities , interstate commissions , and tribal governments to fund a variety of drinking water , wastewater , air , and other environmental projects ; trust funds ( $1.4 billion ) from appropriations to pay for , among other things , superfund and leaking underground storage tank hazardous waste cleanup when responsible parties are not available to pay ; and categorical grants ( $1.1 billion ) to states , tribes , nonprofit organizations , and others for specific environmental programs , including air and radiation , water , drinking water , hazardous waste , and pesticides and toxic chemicals .
