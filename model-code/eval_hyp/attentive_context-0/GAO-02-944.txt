the federal government reimburses the states , which in turn reimburse school food authorities ( offices responsible for the administration of the school meals program in one or more schools ) for each meal served .
the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) , state agencies ( usually departments of education ) , and school food authorities all play a role in administering these school meal programs .
in fiscal year 2001 , the federal government spent about $8 billion in reimbursements for school meals .
to varying degrees , each of these entities performs tasks associated with three of the administrative processes essential to the current operation of the school meal programs: ( 1 ) processing applications , ( 2 ) verifying income eligibility , and ( 3 ) counting the total number of meals served and claiming reimbursement .
because the congress will consider reauthorizing the national school lunch and the school breakfast programs in 2003 , you asked us to develop cost estimates at the federal , state , and local ( school food authorities and schools ) levels associated with processing applications for free and reduced - price meals , verifying eligibility for free and reduced - price meals , and counting all reimbursable meals and snacks and claiming federal reimbursement .
