our objectives were to determine the ( 1 ) status of the information technology exchange program and ( 2 ) challenges facing the program .
we recommend that , as part of opm's responsibilities under the e - gov act , the director of opm include in its semiannual reports to the congress ( 1 ) the number of exchanges that have occurred , as required by law , and ( 2 ) the status of efforts to address challenges facing agencies in implementing itep exchanges and whether these efforts are leading to exchanges .
recognizing the importance of human capital to it and the need to improve the skills of the federal it workforce , the congress created the information technology exchange program ( itep ) as part of the e - government act of 2002 ( e - gov act ) .
as agreed with your offices , we determined ( 1 ) the status of the itep program and ( 2 ) challenges facing agencies in implementing itep .
opm requires that plans address how the program will be carried out ( e.g. , processes and procedures ) ; how many exchanges the agency plans to have ; how employees are selected ; which officials may approve exchanges ; and employee rights to return to the agency .
