this report examines: the costs , revenues , and non - revenue benefits associated with usps's retail facilities ; the nonpostal efforts usps has conducted since 2008 to increase revenues and non - revenue benefits from its retail facilities , and the costs , revenues , non - revenue benefits , and challenges associated with such efforts ; and the key considerations for additional nonpostal efforts usps could pursue to increase revenues and non - revenue benefits from its retail facilities .
given the ubiquity of usps's retail facilities and the costs to maintain them , postal stakeholders , such as the task force on the united states postal system , have suggested that usps could be authorized to offer additional products and services through its retail facilities in order to generate revenue and provide benefits to consumers , other government entities , and communities .
the united states postal service's ( usps ) network of over 31,000 retail facilities , such as post offices , reaches into almost every community in the country and includes about as many outlets as mcdonald's , starbucks , and walmart combined .
