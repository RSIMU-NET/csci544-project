we also agreed to determine whether the perceptions of managers differed by their school's level ( elementary , middle , or high school ) , their school's location ( urban , suburban , or rural ) , and the proportion of their school's lunches served free and at a reduced price .
in fiscal year 1995 , about 26 million students in about 94,000 schools ( public and private schools and residential child care institutions ) nationwide were served lunches each day through the national school lunch program ( nslp ) .
the program's total federal costs for this period were over $5 billion â€” about $4.5 billion in cash reimbursements and over $600 million in commodity foods , such as beef patties , flour , and canned vegetables .
specifically , we agreed to survey a random sample of cafeteria managers in the public schools nationwide that participate in the program to obtain the managers' perceptions on the ( 1 ) extent to which plate waste is a problem , ( 2 ) amount of plate waste by type of food , and ( 3 ) reasons for and ways to reduce plate waste .
