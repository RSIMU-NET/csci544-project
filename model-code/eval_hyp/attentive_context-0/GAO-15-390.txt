in this report , we ( 1 ) evaluated the reliability of medicaid data from the centers for medicare & medicaid ( cms ) and selected states for the purpose of identifying indicators of potential fraud or abuse ; ( 2 ) identified and analyzed indicators , if any , of potentially fraudulent or abusive activities related to prescription drugs in medicaid ; and ( 3 ) examined the extent to which federal and selected state oversight policies , controls , and processes are designed to prevent and detect indicators of prescription - drug fraud in medicaid .
to enhance monitoring of potentially wasteful or abusive practices in the medicaid program , we recommend that the acting administrator of cms require states to report to cms whether their state has lock - in programs for abusers of noncontrolled substances and prohibitions on pharmacy automatic refills , and examine the results to determine whether additional guidance is appropriate .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for overseeing the medicaid program , including disbursing federal matching funds , and provides guidance , technical assistance , and periodic assessments of state medicaid programs .
