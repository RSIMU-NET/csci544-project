specifically , agencies must have ( 1 ) a demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support to address the risks ; ( 2 ) a corrective action plan that identifies the root causes , identifies effective solutions , and provides for substantially completing corrective measures in the near term , including but not limited to steps necessary to implement solutions we recommended ; ( 3 ) the capacity ( that is , the people and other resources ) to resolve the risks ; ( 4 ) a program instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures ; and ( 5 ) the ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures .
in the 12 years since the department's creation , dhs has implemented key homeland security operations , achieved important goals and milestones , and grown to more than 240,000 employees and approximately $60 billion in budget authority .
in doing so , it will be important for dhs to maintain its current level of top leadership support and sustained commitment to ensure continued progress in executing its corrective actions through completion ; continue to implement its plan for addressing this high - risk area and periodically report its progress to us and congress ; identify and work to mitigate any resource gaps , and prioritize initiatives as needed to ensure it can implement and sustain its corrective actions ; closely track and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of its corrective actions and make midcourse adjustments as needed ; and make continued progress in achieving the 21 actions and outcomes it has not fully addressed and demonstrate that systems , personnel , and policies are in place to ensure that progress can be sustained over time .
