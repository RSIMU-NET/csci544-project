you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) issues surrounding whether there is a continuing need for the noaa and phs corps as uniformed services with military - like pay , allowances , and benefits and ( 2 ) what the costs would be if federal civilian employees carried out the corps' functions .
this report responds to your request that we review the operations of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's ( noaa ) commissioned corps .
the objective of this report is to provide information on the operations of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) commissioned corps .
noaa's commissioned corps is a uniformed service whose officers are covered by a military - like compensation system in a manner similar to the commissioned corps of the public health service ( phs ) .
in general , the questions addressed why the noaa corps exists ; what the corps officers' duties are ; how the corps is similar to and different from the military ; and what savings , if any , might result from not using uniformed personnel to carry out current corps functions .
these considerations include ( 1 ) the aggregate amount of a member's ( and his or her spouse's ) income , both earned and unearned ; ( 2 ) the amount of the member's housing and subsistence allowances ; ( 3 ) the member's marital status and number of dependents ; ( 4 ) whether the member takes the standard deduction or itemizes deductions for federal income tax purposes ; and ( 5 ) whether the member is entitled to other types of tax exclusions .
