new events and changes in military , political , or social conditions can generate debate over who is eligible for various military awards .
although congress has traditionally left many military award requirements to the executive branch , the constitution does allow congress to act in this area , and events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the purple heart .
determining which actions and events make a servicemember qualified for receiving a purple heart , and whether expanding eligibility does a disservice to those who have already earned the award , are contentious elements of this debate .
increasingly acknowledged conditions , such as traumatic brain injuries ( tbi ) and post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , as well as accidents and other events while deployed , bring up new questions as to when a servicemember deserves a purple heart .
requirements for military awards and decorations can change over time .
on december 19 , 2014 , congress passed the carl levin and howard p. "buck" mckeon national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2015 .
these groups argue , for example , that a servicemember who acquires ptsd may not always deserve the same recognition as a servicemember killed or wounded in direct combat , while others contend that these medical conditions can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries and can have lasting effects on servicemembers' lives .
