specifically , we examined: ( 1 ) how u.s. agencies have assisted these countries in their efforts to disrupt drug trafficking and what results this assistance has yielded , and ( 2 ) the factors that have impeded counternarcotics efforts in these countries .
we recommend that the secretary of state , in consultation with the director of ondcp , the secretaries of defense and homeland security , and the attorney general , ( 1 ) develop a plan to ensure that partner nations in the transit zone can effectively operate and maintain all counternarcotics assets that the united states has provided , including boats and other vehicles and equipment , for their remaining useful life and report this plan to the congress for the fiscal year 2010 appropriations cycle and ( 2 ) ensure that , before providing a counternarcotics asset to a partner nation , agencies determine the total operations and maintenance cost over its useful life and , with the recipient nation , develop a plan for funding this cost .
we met with u.s. government officials from ondcp ; the departments of defense ( defense ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , justice ( justice ) , and state ; and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .
