the federal government consumed roughly 57.4 million megawatt - hours ( 0.1958 quads ) of electricity to operate all of its u.s. facilities in fy2007 ( the latest information available ) , making it the single largest u.s. electric consumer .
the general services administration ( gsa ) has general statutory authority to enter into utility service contracts of up to 10 years for all federal agencies .
since most renewable forms of energy available substitute for conventionally generated electric power ( including hydropower ) , federal agencies will likely meet the 7.5% goal through purchases of wind and solar photovoltaic generated power ; an equivalent of 4.3 million megawatt - hours based on fy2007 consumption .
the department of defense ( dod ) alone consumed more than half , some 29 million megawatt - hours .
