we focused our work on two key areas: ( 1 ) how well labor's procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are not referred to niosh for dose reconstruction but are being processed by labor and ( 2 ) how well labor's and niosh's procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are referred for dose reconstructions .
for the last several decades , the department of energy ( energy ) and its predecessor agencies and contractors have employed thousands of individuals in secret and dangerous work in the nuclear weapons production complex .
to determine how well the department of labor's ( labor ) procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are not referred to the national institute of occupational safety and health ( niosh ) for dose reconstruction but are being processed by labor , we reviewed labor's regulations , procedures , and practices related to processing claims .
in addition , we interviewed officials from labor's office of workers' compensation programs and its four district offices in cleveland , ohio ; denver , colorado ; jacksonville , florida ; and seattle , washington to discuss their procedures and practices .
