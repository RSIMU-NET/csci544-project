our testimony is based on our prior work and includes assessments of security concerns with ( 1 ) aviation - related computer systems , ( 2 ) airport access controls , and ( 3 ) passenger and carry - on baggage screening , including how the united states and selected other countries differ in their screening practices .
billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system .
faa's efforts to address these problems have been slow .
as we reported last year , our reviews of the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) oversight of air traffic control ( atc ) computer systems showed that faa had not followed some critical aspects of its own security requirements .
faa is addressing these recommendations , but progress on one key effort — the certification of screening companies — is still not complete because the implementing regulation has not been issued .
a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation .
we recommended that faa develop an integrated plan to focus its efforts , set priorities , and measure progress in improving screening .
