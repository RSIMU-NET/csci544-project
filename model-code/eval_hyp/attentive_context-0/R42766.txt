the emergency food and shelter national board program ( efs ) is administered by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , making the program somewhat unique in that its purpose is outside of the agency's traditional focus on preparedness and disaster recovery for individual disaster events .
the report then provides an analysis of the efs program's relationship to other programs assisting those with acute needs , examines its funding , and congressional debate concerning its efficacy in helping individuals meet emergency needs and transition out of poverty .
efs funding is provided to private non - profit organizations and local governments to supplement and expand their efforts to provide shelter , food , and supportive services for homeless individuals , to strengthen efforts to create more effective and innovative local programs , and to conduct minimum rehabilitation of existing mass shelter or mass feeding facilities , but only to the extent necessary to make facilities safe , sanitary , and bring them into compliance with local building codes .
however , in recent years , the program's funding has been reduced .
also , delays in distributing funds over the last two fiscal years have caused uncertainty among recipient organizations .
