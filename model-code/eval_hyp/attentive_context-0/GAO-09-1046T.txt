i will discuss ( 1 ) state's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts , and ( 2 ) state's efforts to meet its foreign language requirements .
in recent years gao has issued a number of reports on human capital issues that have hampered state's ability to carry out the president's foreign policy objectives ( see appendix i for a complete list of related gao products ) .
a common element of these problems has been a longstanding staffing and experience deficit , which has both contributed to the gaps at hardship posts and fueled the language shortfall by limiting the number of staff available for language training .
to address these objectives in our two reports , we analyzed key planning documents and other data provided by state ; reviewed relevant reports by gao and other agencies and organizations ; and met with a number of state officials from various bureaus in washington and overseas .
the department of state ( state ) faces an ongoing challenge of ensuring it has the right people , with the right skills , in the right places overseas to carry out the department's priorities .
