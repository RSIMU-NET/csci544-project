i am pleased to be here today to discuss the progress made and challenges that remain for the department of defense's ( dod ) missile defense agency ( mda ) in developing and fielding the ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) .
we have reported on the limited usefulness of mda's acquisition baselines for oversight due to ( 1 ) a lack of clarity , consistency , and completeness ; ( 2 ) a lack of high - quality supporting cost estimates and schedules ; and ( 3 ) instability in the content of the baselines .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 required us to report on our assessment of the extent to which mda has achieved its stated acquisition goals and objectives , as reported through their acquisition baselines , and also to include any other findings and recommendations on mda acquisition programs and accountability as appropriate .
in addition to a recent change in the agency's leadership , mda is responding to the secretary of defense's march 2013 announcement to increase the planned numbers of ground - based interceptors designed to protect the united states as well as to changes in plans for u.s. missile defense in europe .
