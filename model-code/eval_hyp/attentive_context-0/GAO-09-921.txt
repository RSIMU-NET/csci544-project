to determine the extent to which federal agencies are using cost - reimbursement contracts , we extracted and analyzed , from the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) , cost - reimbursement coded contract actions and dollars obligated by agencies for fiscal years 2003 to 2007 .
this type of contract is considered high risk for the government because of the potential for cost escalation and because the government pays a contractor's costs of performance regardless of whether the work is completed .
at your request , we reviewed the federal government's use of cost - reimbursement contracts and identified agencies' reported obligations under these contracts , determined what agencies are buying using cost - reimbursement contracts , assessed contracting officers' rationales for using this contract type and whether analysis is being conducted to determine whether a different contract type is warranted based on experience with the requirement , determined whether contractors' accounting systems had been deemed adequate for determining costs applicable to the contracts , and identified agencies' procedures for surveillance of contractor cost controls .
to mitigate risk and help ensure that the best interests of the government are served when entering into a cost - reimbursement contract , agencies may use this contract type only if the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract .
