for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been challenged in modernizing its timeworn business systems .
to improve gcss - mc management of program risks , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy , through the appropriate chain of command , to ensure that the program office ( 1 ) adds each of the risks discussed in this report to its active inventory of risks , ( 2 ) tracks and evaluates the implementation of mitigation plans for all risks , ( 3 ) discloses to appropriate program oversight and approval authorities whether mitigation plans have been fully executed and have produced the intended outcome ( s ) , and ( 4 ) only closes a risk if its mitigation plan has been fully executed and produced the intended outcome ( s ) .
these it acquisition management control weaknesses include compliance with dod's federated bea not being sufficiently expected costs not being reliably estimated ; earned value management not being adequately implemented ; system requirements not always being effectively managed , although this has recently improved ; key program risks not being effectively managed ; and key system quality measures not being used .
