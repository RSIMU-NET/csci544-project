to improve usaid's ability to measure progress in achieving a quantitative reading goal in any future education strategy , we recommend that the acting administrator ensure that the future strategy includes targets that will allow usaid to monitor interim progress toward its goal in comparison with planned performance .
this report ( 1 ) examines five usaid missions' implementation , performance monitoring , and evaluation of primary grade reading programs and ( 2 ) assesses usaid's efforts to estimate progress toward the 2011-2015 education strategy's primary grade reading goal .
however , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) reports that while many developing countries have achieved important gains in enrolling children in primary school , reading skills remain very low .
in fiscal year 2013 — the first year in which missions' education programs were expected to be fully aligned with the goals of the education strategy — the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) allocated funding to 41 countries for programs to improve the reading skills of 100 million children in primary grades by december 2015 — goal 1 of its education strategy .
