specifically , this report addresses the ( 1 ) scope of public and private telemedicine investments ; ( 2 ) telemedicine strategies among dod , other federal agencies , and the private sector ; ( 3 ) potential benefits that the public and private sectors may yield from telemedicine initiatives ; and ( 4 ) barriers facing telemedicine implementation .
the strategy should clearly define the scope of telemedicine in dod ; establish dod - wide goals and objectives and identify actions and appropriate milestones for achieving them ; prioritize and target near - and long - term investments , especially for goals related to combat casualty care and operations other than war ; and clarify roles of dod oversight organizations .
as a result , dod's ( 1 ) organizational structure to ensure the infusion of telemedicine into application is still evolving , ( 2 ) telemedicine program has not been precisely defined , ( 3 ) budgets do not reflect a comprehensive telemedicine program , and ( 4 ) partnerships with the private sector have not been fully explored .
