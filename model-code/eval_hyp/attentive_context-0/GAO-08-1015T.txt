my testimony today addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which states have implemented hsip requirements set forth in safetea - lu , including key elements of strategic highway safety plans and crash data analysis systems , ( 2 ) the types of guidance and assistance fhwa provided to the states to support them in planning and carrying out hsip , and ( 3 ) the results to date of states' efforts in carrying out hsip , including the results of the set - aside programs for rail - highway crossings and for high - risk rural roads .
the program , established in 1973 , provides funds through the federal aid highway program to states primarily for infrastructure and other improvements designed to reduce the number of crashes , serious injuries , and fatalities on the nation's roads .
my statement today focuses on our ongoing work on the federal highway administration's ( fhwa ) highway safety improvement program ( hsip ) .
states must now prepare a strategic highway safety plan that addresses all aspects of highway safety , which include infrastructure improvements , behavioral approaches such as education and enforcement projects meant to change drivers' behavior , and emergency medical services approaches .
