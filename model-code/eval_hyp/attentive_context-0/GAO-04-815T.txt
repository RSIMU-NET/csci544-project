the report also includes a description of the status of dod's investigations on potential exposures of service members and veterans to health hazards , such as chemical and biological agents , and efforts that have been made by va and dod to monitor cancer incidence among gulf war veterans .
federal gulf war illnesses research projects have been funded primarily by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the department of defense ( dod ) , and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
in recent years , va and dod have decreased their expenditures on research specifically for gulf war illnesses and have expanded the scope of their medical research programs to incorporate the long - term health effects of all hazardous deployments .
the committee is made up of members of the general public , including non - va researchers and veterans' advocates .
my statement is based on our report entitled department of veterans affairs: federal gulf war illnesses research strategy needs reassessment ( gao - 04-767 ) , which will be issued today .
interagency committees formed by va to coordinate federal gulf war illnesses research evolved to reflect these changing priorities , but over time these entities have been dissolved or have become inactive .
