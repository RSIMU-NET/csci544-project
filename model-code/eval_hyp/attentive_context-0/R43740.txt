the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides an array of benefits to veterans and to certain members of their families .
for example , the united states department of agriculture is under no similar obligation to assist applicants in obtaining evidence of eligibility for supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) benefits ; the social security administration does not give "the benefit of the doubt" to applicants for social security benefits .
these benefits include disability compensation and pensions , education benefits , survivor benefits , medical treatment , life insurance , vocational rehabilitation , and burial and memorial benefits .
this duty to assist and the benefit of the doubt standard are unique among the federal government's benefits programs .
in order to apply for these benefits , in most circumstances , the claimant will send an application to his or her local va regional office or apply online .
this duty includes obligations to ensure that a claimant's file is complete , to seek evidence and records substantiating the claim , and to provide medical examinations under certain circumstances .
furthermore , the va , when adjudicating any claim for benefits , is obligated to give the claimant the "benefit of the doubt" when there is "an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding" any claim , and must also consider legal theories that a claimant fails to raise if it would help substantiate a claim for benefits .
