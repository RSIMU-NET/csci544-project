for example , school districts and charter schools are increasingly contracting with private , for - profit companies to provide a range of education and management services to schools .
as agreed with your office , we ( 1 ) identified the characteristics of their programs and determined the extent to which district schools managed by them have used their programs and ( 2 ) determined what is known about the effectiveness of these companies' educational programs , as measured primarily by student achievement .
to identify relevant research , we followed three procedures: ( 1 ) interviewed experts to find out what studies were completed or in the process of being completed on the effectiveness of company programs ; ( 2 ) conducted library and internet searches ; and ( 3 ) reviewed bibliographies of studies that focused on the effectiveness of company programs .
