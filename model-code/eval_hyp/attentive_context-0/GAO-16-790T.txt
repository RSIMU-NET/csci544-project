examples of progress and challenges in the areas of ( 1 ) using information for improving targeting and risk assessment of cargo shipments , ( 2 ) partnerships with foreign governments , and ( 3 ) partnerships with the trade industry are discussed below .
cbp's layered security strategy is based on initiatives and programs that include , among other things , analyzing information to identify shipments that may be at high risk of transporting weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) or other contraband , working with foreign governments to examine u.s. - bound shipments at foreign ports participating in the container security initiative ( csi ) and secure freight initiative ( sfi ) , and providing benefits to companies that comply with cbp's minimum security criteria through the customs - trade partnership against terrorism ( c - tpat ) program .
the u.s. economy is dependent on the expeditious flow of millions of tons of cargo each day through the global supply chain â€” the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailers .
our prior work has shown that cbp has made substantial progress in implementing various initiatives and programs that , collectively , have enhanced cargo security , but some challenges remain .
