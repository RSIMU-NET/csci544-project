to enhance its oversight of drug shortages , particularly as the agency fine - tunes the manner in which it gathers data on shortages and transitions from its database to a more robust system , we recommend that the commissioner of fda take the following two actions: develop policies and procedures for the use of the existing drug shortages database ( and , ultimately , the new drug shortages information system ) to ensure staff enter information into the database in a consistent manner and to ensure the accuracy of the information in the database ; and conduct periodic analyses using the existing drug shortages database ( and , eventually , the new drug shortages information system ) to routinely and systematically assess drug shortage information , and use this information proactively to identify risk factors for potential drug shortages early , thereby potentially helping fda to recognize trends , clarify causes , and resolve problems before drugs go into short supply .
several recommendations for fda , including assessing the resources that fda allocates to its dss ; developing an information system to manage data on shortages ; ensuring that fda's strategic plan articulates goals and priorities for maintaining the availability of drugs ; and developing results - oriented performance metrics related to fda's response to drug shortages .
