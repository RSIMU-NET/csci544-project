for this report we examined ( 1 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of the yucca mountain repository ; ( 2 ) alternative nuclear waste management approaches ; ( 3 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of storing the nuclear waste at two centralized sites ; and ( 4 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of continuing to store the nuclear waste at its current locations .
federal agencies , industry , and policymakers may also want to consider a strategy of complementary and parallel interim and long - term disposal options — similar to those being pursued by some other nations — which might provide the federal government with maximum flexibility , since it would allow time to work with local communities and to pursue research and development efforts in key areas , such as reprocessing .
specifically , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of the yucca mountain repository ; ( 2 ) and identify alternative nuclear waste management approaches ; ( 3 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of storing the nuclear waste at two centralized sites ; and ( 4 ) the key attributes , challenges , and costs of continuing to store the nuclear waste at its current locations .
