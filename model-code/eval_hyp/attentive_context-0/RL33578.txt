energy tax policy involves the use of the government's main fiscal instruments — taxes ( financial disincentives ) and tax subsidies ( or incentives ) — to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources .
this bill included a provision that further increased taxes on major integrated oil companies by extending the depreciation recovery period for geological and geophysical costs from two to five years ( thus taking back some of the benefits enacted under the 2005 law ) .
in theory , energy taxes and subsidies , like tax policy instruments in general , are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some social , economic ( efficiency , equity , or even macroeconomic ) , environmental , or fiscal objective .
a minus sign ( " - " ) indicates revenue losses , which means that the provision is a tax subsidy or incentive , intended to increase the subsidized activity ( energy conservation measures or the supply of some alternative and renewable fuel or technology ) ; no minus sign means that the provision is a tax , which means that it should reduce supply of , or demand for , the taxed activity ( either conventional fuel supply , energy demand , or the demand for energy - using technologies , such as cars ) .
