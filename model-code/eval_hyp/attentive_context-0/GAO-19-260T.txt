my statement today provides information on ( 1 ) the status of the mandated national strategies and ( 2 ) challenges that stakeholders identified related to sustaining the u.s. - flag fleet for defense needs and options dot has considered for addressing them .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on efforts by the departments of transportation ( dot ) and defense ( dod ) to draft a national maritime strategy that addresses challenges the government faces in supporting the fleet of u.s. - flag vessels .
dod largely relies on internationally - trading u.s. - flag vessels ( vessels registered in the united states that must be mainly crewed by u.s. citizens ) for sealift â€” the process of transporting government equipment and supplies by sea for military purposes .
in the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , the statutory deadline for the national maritime strategy was extended from february 2015 to february 2020 .
despite the msp and cargo preference requirements that have helped support the u.s. - flag fleet , concerns have been raised about the fleet's future sustainability the u.s. - flag fleet has been in decline for many years and increasingly faces difficulties in competing for international cargo due to the higher costs of operating under the u.s. flag .
