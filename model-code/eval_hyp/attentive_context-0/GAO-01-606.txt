payments to farmers under federal farm programs have reached an historic high â€” over $20 billion in fiscal year 2000 .
concerned that farm payments are not being effectively targeted to aid the survival of small farms and the entry of young people into agriculture , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the distribution of farm payments over the past decade by farm size , operators' age , state , and crop and ( 2 ) identify the major barriers that make it difficult for young people to enter farming .
despite this annual influx of billions of federal dollars to the farm sector , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) reports that the number of farms has been declining about 1 percent per year .
nearly one - half of u.s. farms are receiving payments for income or price support purposes and / or for engaging in activities such as land conservation .
these payments , in total , made up almost one - half of net farm income in fiscal year 2000 .
although the payments averaged about $17,000 for the farms receiving them in 1999 , the level of assistance can range from a few dollars up to tens of thousands of dollars .
