this report addresses test and evaluation of software - intensive systems and the department of defense's efforts to improve the software process .
dod has not adequately ( 1 ) coordinated its efforts to develop and use software metrics for defense acquisition programs ; ( 2 ) made maximum use of contractors' software development processes that have been favorably assessed by credible , independent evaluation ; ( 3 ) developed team - building efforts to ensure the early and continuous involvement of users with acquisition , post - deployment support and testing personnel ; and ( 4 ) filled in the policy and oversight voids that have contributed to the shortfalls that we have addressed .
overall , dod has not ( 1 ) developed an overarching strategy that ensures development and implementation of key software test and evaluation policy throughout dod ; ( 2 ) issued definitive acquisition and life - cycle support policies that focus on software test and evaluation ; and ( 3 ) adopted a focused , disciplined approach to software development and test and evaluation that recognizes the critical nature of software .
although dod recognizes these problems , it has made only limited progress in adopting solutions .
