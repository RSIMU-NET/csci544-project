to systematically gauge the extent to which deficiencies identified by individual aibs may be occurring throughout vha ; and to maximize opportunities for sharing information across vha to improve its overall operations , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for health to take the following two actions for aib investigations conducted within vha: establish a process to collect and analyze aggregate data from aib investigations , including the number of investigations conducted , the types of matters investigated , whether the matters were substantiated , and systemic deficiencies identified ; and establish a process for sharing information about systemic changes , including policies and procedures implemented in response to the results of aib investigations , which may have broader applicability throughout vha .
aib investigations that do not adequately address critical issues , or that reach findings , conclusions , or recommendations not supported by the evidence , are an ineffective use of resources and may also adversely affect va's operations and systems , including the quality of care provided in its medical centers ; the morale of its employees ; and its public image .
in this report , we focused on aib investigations conducted in vha , and examined: ( 1 ) the process va uses to convene and conduct aib investigations , ( 2 ) the extent to which va collects data on aib investigations , and ( 3 ) how va has used the results of its aib investigations .
