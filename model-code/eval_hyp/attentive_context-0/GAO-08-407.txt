new advances in technology , coupled with the ongoing shift in force posture , mean that the department of defense ( dod ) needs to continually update and maintain its training ranges .
this report discusses the effects , if any , of ( 1 ) environmental laws on dod's training activities and military readiness , ( 2 ) dod's use of exemptions from environmental laws on training activities , and ( 3 ) dod's use of exemptions on the environment .
since 2002 , dod has repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought enactment of the three remaining provisions , which would exempt dod from certain requirements of the clean air act ; the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) ; and the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) .
we found that ( 1 ) while the services had individually taken a varying number of key management improvement actions , such as developing range sustainment policies , these actions lacked consistency across dod or focused primarily on encroachment without including commensurate efforts on other issues , such as maintenance and modernization ; ( 2 ) though the services could not precisely identify the funding required and used for their ranges , range requirements had historically been inadequately funded ; and ( 3 ) although dod policy , reports , and plans had either recommended or required specific actions , dod had not fully implemented these actions .
