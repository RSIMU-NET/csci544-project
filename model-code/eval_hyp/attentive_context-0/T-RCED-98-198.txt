we found that the performance measures in the assistance agreements generally assess activities ( such as the number of loans made ) rather than accomplishments reflecting the results of activities ( such as the number of new low - income homeowners ) .
as you know , access to credit and investment capital is essential for creating and retaining jobs , developing affordable housing , revitalizing neighborhoods , and promoting the development and growth of small businesses .
finally , our testimony will review the fund's progress in meeting the strategic planning requirements of the government performance and results act of 1993 ( results act ) .
to date , the fund has sought to expand access to credit and other financial services in distressed communities primarily through two programs â€” the cdfi and the bank enterprise award ( bea ) programs .
the cdfi program provides financial and technical assistance to a wide range of for - profit and nonprofit financial institutions to support their activities in distressed communities and monitors their performance over a period of at least 5 years .
the fund reserved about $37 million for awardees in the cdfi program and $13.1 million for banks selected to participate in the bea program .
