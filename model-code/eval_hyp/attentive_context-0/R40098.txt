since the 107 th congress , one of the dominant cwa issues has been water infrastructure financing — that is , extension and modification of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects .
in the 104 th congress ( 1995 ) , the house passed a comprehensive reauthorization bill that was opposed by the clinton administration and environmental groups ; it was not enacted .
although much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established more than 35 years ago to restore and maintain the chemical , physical , and biological integrity of the nation's waters , long - standing problems persist , and new problems have emerged .
since then , no comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced , but beginning in the 106 th congress , a number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues in the law have been enacted — especially , legislation to reauthorize several existing cwa programs .
criticism has come from industry , which has been the long - standing focus of the act's regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and costly requirements .
it concludes with a discussion of water quality appropriations and water infrastructure as part of economic stimulus legislation in 2009 .
