since most of these costs had not been reported by dod , the chairman requested that we review and report on ( 1 ) the scope of ongoing operations at dod installations that have associated environmental cleanup costs , ( 2 ) the potential magnitude of cleanup costs associated with those operations , and ( 3 ) the availability of data to develop related cleanup cost estimates .
the previous chairman of your committee expressed concern about the long - term budgetary implications associated with environmental cleanup costs related to the ongoing operations of the department of defense ( dod ) .
our objectives were to determine: ( 1 ) the scope of ongoing dod operations with potentially significant cleanup costs , ( 2 ) the potential magnitude of costs to clean up and dispose of the hazardous waste resulting from those operations , and ( 3 ) the availability of data for developing cleanup cost estimates .
working largely with personnel already responsible for derp reporting , we identified over 200 sites with estimated cleanup costs in excess of $250 million , most of which had not been previously reported .
dod partially concurred with the remaining three recommendations .
