the federal aviation administration ( faa ) is responsible for aviation safety , in part by issuing certificates for new air operators , new aircraft , and aircraft parts and equipment , as well as granting approvals for such things as changes to air operations and aircraft , and the design and production of aircraft parts and equipment .
to do so , we addressed ( 1 ) the extent of variation in faa's interpretation of standards with regard to the agency's certification and approval decisions and ( 2 ) key stakeholder and expert views on how well the certification and approval processes work .
a 1996 study by booz allen & hamilton , conducted at the request of the faa administrator to assess challenges to the agency's regulatory and certification practices , reported that , for air carriers and other operators , the agency's regulations are often ambiguous ; subject to variation in interpretation by faa inspectors , supervisors , and policy managers ; and in need of simplification and consistent implementation .
it describes the processes and discusses ( 1 ) the extent of variation in faa's interpretation of standards with regard to the agency's certification and approval decisions and ( 2 ) key stakeholder and expert views on how well the certification and approval processes work .
