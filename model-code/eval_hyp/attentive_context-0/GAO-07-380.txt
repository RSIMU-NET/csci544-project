as agreed with committee staff , this report addresses the questions from the mandate , specifically: ( 1 ) why the army decided to employ an lsi for the fcs program ; ( 2 ) the nature of the lsi's working relationship with the army ; and ( 3 ) how the contract fees , provisions , and incentives work .
with the future combat systems ( fcs ) program , the army is embracing a new warfighting concept by replacing most of its combat systems with a family of manned and unmanned vehicles and systems linked by an advanced information network .
dod concurred with our recommendations .
recent estimates show that the total investment cost of the fcs program will be at least $163 billion and perhaps over $200 billion when complementary programs are included .
to achieve its goals for the fcs program , in 2003 the army decided to employ a lead systems integrator ( lsi ) to assist in defining , developing , and integrating fcs .
in the case of the fcs program , the role of the lsi is not simply that of a traditional prime contractor , but also includes some elements of a partner to the government in ensuring the design , development and prototype implementation of the fcs network and family of systems .
