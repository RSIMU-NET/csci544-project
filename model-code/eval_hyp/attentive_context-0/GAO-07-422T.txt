from 2000 to 2005 , the program has grown from $15 billion in benefits provided to 17 million individuals to $29 billion in benefits to nearly 26 million individuals .
to reduce program vulnerabilities and ensure limited compliance - monitoring resources are used efficiently , gao recommended in its october 2006 trafficking report that fns take additional steps to target and provide early oversight of stores most likely to traffic ; develop a strategy to increase penalties for trafficking , working with the inspector general as needed ; and promote state efforts to pursue recipients suspected of trafficking .
as you know , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food stamp program is intended to help low - income individuals and families obtain a better diet by supplementing their income with benefits to purchase food .
usda's food and nutrition service ( fns ) and the states jointly implement the food stamp program , which is to be reauthorized after it expires in fiscal year 2007 .
the information i am presenting today is based primarily on findings from our past work on two issues related to ensuring integrity of the program: ( 1 ) improper payments to food stamp participants , and ( 2 ) trafficking in food stamp benefits .
