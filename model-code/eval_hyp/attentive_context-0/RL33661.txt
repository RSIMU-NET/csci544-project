proponents of the labor shortage scenario assert that the nation's rate of economic ( output ) growth will slow because worker - starved u.s. firms would be unable to produce the quantity of goods and services demanded by u.s. consumers .
concern about this possibility waned when the historically low unemployment rates from 1998 to 2000 rose during , and for some two years after , the march - november 2001 recession .
in 2007 , however , the national unemployment rate averaged just 4.6% .
this suggests the presence of tight labor market conditions that are related to long - running demographic trends .
the oldest members of the baby - boom generation will reach 60 years of age by the end of 2006 , and every year thereafter , more of the 76 million persons born between 1946 and 1964 will move into their early 60s , when most workers traditionally have retired .
while the public budgetary effects of the aging of the baby - boom cohort have been much studied , the implications for the private economy have been less thoroughly researched .
the scenario similarly does not consider that congress might take legislative action to mitigate the effect on the private economy of a perceived shortfall of workers â€” something it has done in the recent past ( e.g. , loosening and raising the cap on h - 1b visas for foreign workers in professional occupations ) .
