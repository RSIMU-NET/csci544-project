we selected our sample states using five criteria , specifically ( 1 ) recommendations from samhsa officials , researchers in the field of peer support , and national - level mental health organizations on states with well - established programs ; ( 2 ) samhsa data that indicated that a state had reported using samhsa's community mental health services block grant for peer support generally ; ( 3 ) the age of the state's certification program was at least 2 years old ; ( 4 ) geographic diversity across the united states ; and ( 5 ) the prevalence of serious mental illness among adults in the state .
specifically , based on its annual survey of behavioral health issues , the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) estimated that 10.4 million adults in 2016 had a serious mental illness ; however , only 6.7 million adults received treatment for these issues in the past year .
federal data and academic research show an unmet need for behavioral health services â€” that is , for services that address mental health or substance use issues .
