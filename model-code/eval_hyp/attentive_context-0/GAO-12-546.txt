in this report , we ( 1 ) describe the process hrsa uses to oversee grantee compliance with health center program requirements , and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which hrsa's process identifies and addresses noncompliance with these program requirements .
the nationwide network of health centers in the federal health center program is an important component of the health care safety net for vulnerable populations , including medicaid beneficiaries , people who are uninsured , and others who may have difficulty obtaining access to health care .
as part of our assessment of the extent to which the health resources and services administration's ( hrsa ) process identifies and addresses noncompliance with health center program requirements , we reviewed hrsa's oversight of eight selected health center grantees .
to fulfill the health center program's mission of providing comprehensive , quality primary health care services for the medically underserved , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) provides grants to eligible health centers under section 330 of the public health service act .
the remaining 3 requirements we selected for review were those requiring grantees to: provide professional coverage , such as access to a physician , for patients after normal health center hours ( after hours coverage ) ; possess sufficient management expertise to run the health center ( key management staff ) ; and have a policy to prevent conflicts of interest ( conflict of interest ) .
