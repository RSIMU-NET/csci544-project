my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) u.s. efforts to develop capable anp forces ; ( 2 ) challenges that affect the development of capable anp forces ; and ( 3 ) our analysis of u.s. efforts to develop a coordinated , detailed plan for completing and sustaining the ansf , including the anp .
my testimony is based on our concurrently issued report regarding u.s. efforts to develop the afghan national security forces ( ansf ) , which consist of the afghan national army ( ana ) and the anp .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss u.s. efforts to assist in the development of afghan national police ( anp ) forces and the establishment of rule of law in afghanistan .
these include ( 1 ) shortages in the police mentors needed to provide training and evaluation and verify that police are on duty ; ( 2 ) shortfalls in several types of equipment that defense considers critical ; ( 3 ) a weak judicial system ; and ( 4 ) consistent problems with police pay , corruption , and attacks by insurgents .
we continue to believe that a coordinated , detailed plan that outlines agency roles and responsibilities and includes clear milestones is essential to ensuring accountability of u.s. efforts and facilitating assessment of progress .
