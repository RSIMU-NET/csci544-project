specifically , this report examines: 1. the extent to which the national mediation board follows federal strategic planning requirements and leading practices , 2. the extent to which the national mediation board has key management controls in place — for financial management ; information management , security , and privacy ; human capital and workforce development ; and procurement — to fulfill its mission , and 3. how the national mediation board addresses challenges , if any , in its process for overseeing employee representation elections .
we reviewed key nmb documents , including its most recent 5-year strategic plan , its annual performance and accountability report , and congressional budget justification documents , and compared nmb's performance planning and reporting practices with requirements in the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) as updated by the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) and related leading practices identified in our previous work .
nmb faces additional management issues .
in addition , we assessed nmb's plans , policies , and practices in financial management ; information management , security , and privacy ; human capital ; and procurement using gao's standards for internal control in the federal government , the federal information security management act of 2002 , privacy act of 1974 , e - government act of 2002 , guidelines developed by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the national institute of standards and technology , and criteria developed by gao in prior work .
