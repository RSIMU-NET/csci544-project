rules of origin ( roo ) , the methodology used to prove country of origin , are central components of u.s. trade policy .
u.s. trade policy also seeks to promote economic growth in developing countries by offering trade preference programs , including the generalized system of preferences ( gsp ) , and the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa ) .
the country of origin of an imported product is defined in u.s. trade laws and customs regulations as the country of manufacture , production , or growth of any article of foreign origin entering the customs territory of the united states .
if congress desires to provide greater preferential access to the u.s. market ( and gain reciprocal access to the markets of trading partners ) , it could urge u.s. negotiators to liberalize roo , and to examine the costs and benefits of applying a uniform set of preferential roo with respect to future fta negotiations .
there are two types of rules of origin ( roo ) : non - preferential roo are used to determine the origin of goods imported from countries with which the united states has most - favored - nation ( mfn ) status , and are the principal regulatory tools for accurate assessment of tariffs on imports , addressing country of origin labeling issues , qualifying goods for government procurement , and enforcing trade remedy actions and trade sanctions .
