we are pleased to be here to discuss the challenges the federal protective service ( fps ) faces in carrying out its mission to protect federal facilities , particularly with regard to ( 1 ) risk management , ( 2 ) strategic human capital planning , ( 3 ) oversight of its contract guard program , and ( 4 ) ensuring that its fee - based funding structure is the appropriate mechanism for funding the agency .
fps's primary responsibilities include ( 1 ) conducting risk assessments of federal facilities and recommending countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents at facilities ; and ( 2 ) undertaking law enforcement activities , including responding to incidents at federal facilities .
we will also discuss fps's assessment of its performance and the extent to which fps has made progress in responding to these challenges .
recent events have exposed weaknesses with fps's ability to protect federal facilities , including gao's covert testing at federal facilities in 2009 , fps's ongoing penetration testing at federal facilities , and fps's contract security guards allowing components of an active bomb to remain in a federal building in detroit , michigan , for three weeks in march 2011 before a bomb squad was called .
