specifically , we address issues pertaining to ( 1 ) how bop estimates costs when developing its annual budget request to doj ; ( 2 ) the extent to which bop's methods for estimating costs follow established best practices or guidelines ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which bop's costs for key operations exceeded requested funding levels identified in the president's budget in recent years , and how this has affected bop's ability to manage its growing inmate population .
to improve transparency in bop's cost estimation process , as well as doj's annual budget formulation and justification process , and to provide doj with more detailed information to consider when deliberating its budget proposal for bop , we recommend that the attorney general take the following two actions: instruct the bop director to require the bop budget staff to conduct an uncertainty analysis quantifying the extent to which operations costs could vary due to changes in key cost assumptions and submit the results along with budget documentation to doj so that doj could be aware of the range of likely costs and bop's associated confidence levels ; and instruct the bop director to require the bop budget staff to improve documentation of calculations used to estimate its costs .
