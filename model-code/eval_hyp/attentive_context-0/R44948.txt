the social security administration ( ssa ) is responsible for administering two federal entitlement programs that provide income support to individuals with severe , long - term disabilities: social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
in contrast , ssi is a need - based public assistance program that provides monthly cash payments to aged , blind , or disabled individuals ( including blind or disabled children ) who have limited assets and little or no social security or other income .
in 2017 , ssdi and ssi combined paid an estimated $199 billion in federally administered benefits to 14.5 million qualified disabled individuals and 1.5 million non - disabled dependents of disabled workers .
ssdi is a work - related social insurance program that provides monthly cash benefits to nonelderly disabled workers and their eligible dependents , provided the workers accrued a sufficient number of earnings credits during their careers in jobs subject to social security taxes .
both programs use the same basic definition of disability to determine eligibility ; however , by virtue of design , each program serves a somewhat different population .
it also explains how benefit amounts are computed , the types of non - cash benefits available to individuals who meet ssa's disability standards , and how each program is financed .
