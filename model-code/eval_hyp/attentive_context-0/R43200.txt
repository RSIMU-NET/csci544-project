this report first discusses water - related energy use broadly and then energy for facilities that treat and deliver water to end users and also dispose of and discharge wastewater .
examples of interrelationships between water and energysource: u.s. department of energy , energy demands on water resources , report to congress on the interdependency of energy and water , december 2006 , p. 13 .
regulatory barriers also exist .
meeting energy needs depends upon the availability of water , often in large quantities , for mineral extraction and mining , fuel production , hydropower , and thermoelectric power plant cooling .
this interdependence , which is often described as the water - energy nexus , or energy - water nexus , is illustrated in the following graphic from a u.s. department of energy report .
likewise , energy is required for the pumping , conveyance , treatment and conditioning , and distribution of water and for collection , treatment , and discharge of wastewater .
thus , more education and outreach to all types of water users , the general public , and public officials are needed on the water - energy nexus and how improving efficiency involves linkages between saving energy and saving water .
