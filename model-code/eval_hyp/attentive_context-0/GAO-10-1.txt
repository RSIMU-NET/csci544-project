the departments of defense ( dod ) and state and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) have relied extensively on contractors to support troops and civilian personnel and to oversee and carry out reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan .
we are providing the results of our analyses of agency - reported data for fiscal year 2008 and the first half of fiscal year 2009 regarding ( 1 ) the agencies' implementation of spot , ( 2 ) the number of contractor personnel , including those performing security functions , working on dod , state , and usaid contracts with performance in iraq and afghanistan , ( 3 ) the number of contractor personnel killed or wounded , and ( 4 ) the number and value of contracts that were active and awarded during our 18-month review period and the extent of competition for new contract awards .
