geospatial information technologies — sensors , systems , and software that collect , manage , manipulate , analyze , model , and display information about locations on the earth's surface — can aid in managing wildland fires by providing accurate , detailed , and timely information to federal , state , and local decision makers , fire - fighting personnel , and the public .
however , there are multiple challenges to effectively using these technologies to manage wildland fires , including challenges with data , systems , infrastructure , staffing , and the effective use of new products .
however , progress on these initiatives has been slow .
in our final report , due to be issued next month , we will further discuss geospatial information technologies , challenges to effectively using these technologies , and opportunities to improve the effective use of geospatial information technologies .
in our report , due to be issued in september 2003 , we further discuss the use of geospatial technologies in support of wildland fire management , challenges to effectively using these technologies , and opportunities to address key challenges and to improve the effective use of geospatial technologies .
