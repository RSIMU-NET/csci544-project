this report responds to your request that we identify features of a model nutrition monitoring system and examine approaches to incorporating those features in the national nutrition monitoring and related research program ( nnmrrp ) .
the first , nutrition monitoring: progress in developing a coordinated program ( gao / pemd - 94-23 ) , assessed the nnmrrp's planning activities .
it builds on two earlier reports .
completing our response to the committee's request , this report builds on our earlier work to meet two objectives: ( 1 ) define a model nutrition monitoring program and ( 2 ) compare the current system with potential options for implementing the components of a model program in the nnmrrp .
specifically , chapter 3 examines coordination options ; chapter 4 compares alternate approaches to providing continuous data ; chapter 5 discusses different methods of supporting inferences about subpopulation groups and small geographic areas ; and chapter 6 reviews approaches to assisting state and local monitoring activities .
