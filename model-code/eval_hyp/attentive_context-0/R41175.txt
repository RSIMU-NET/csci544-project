these negotiations yielded the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) in 1992 .
formal international negotiations to address human - driven climate change were launched in december 1990 .
the unfccc provides a structure for international consideration of climate change .
the unfccc entered into force on march 21 , 1994 .
the unfccc does not set binding targets for greenhouse gas ( "ghg" ) emissions .
the kyoto protocol to the unfccc ( the protocol ) was negotiated as the first step towards implementing the unfccc .
it establishes quantitative emission reduction targets for the high income countries listed in the protocol's annex b and market - based mechanisms , including emissions trading , for achieving those targets .
in doing so , the parties established two tracks for negotiation: ( 1 ) a track by which kyoto protocol parties would pursue an amendment to the protocol for a "second round" of emission targets for annex i parties , and ( 2 ) a track by which unfccc parties would seek agreement on ghg mitigation targets or actions for all parties .
recognizing that the emissions reductions for the kyoto protocol were set for a period that would end in 2012 , the 2007 un climate change conference in bali adopted the "bali road map" as a framework for negotiations over the post - 2012 climate regime .
