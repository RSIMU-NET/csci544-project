for that work , we examined va's collections data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and available data for 2003 ; reviewed relevant va documents , such as the veterans health administration's ( vha ) revenue cycle improvement plan of september 2001 ; and interviewed officials in va headquarters and in 3 of va's 21 health care networks — network 2 ( albany ) , network 9 ( nashville ) , and network 22 ( long beach ) .
concerned about these issues you asked that we report on ( 1 ) trends in va's third - party collections , ( 2 ) problems in collections operations , and ( 3 ) va's approach for improving collections .
the total number of veterans va treated has increased from 2.6 million in fiscal year 1996 to 4.3 million in fiscal year 2002 , and va predicts continuing growth in its patient workload .
over the past several years , concerns have been raised about va's ability to maximize its third - party collections to enhance revenues .
we testified in september 2001 that problems in va's collections operations — such as inadequate patient intake procedures to gather insurance information , insufficient physician documentation , a shortage of qualified coders , and insufficient automation — diminished va's collections .
