in its effort to develop such statements ofgenerality this report will study the work and results of a number of commissions and other similarbodies that have had executive organization and reorganization as part of their mandate .
context for discussion of landmark commissions in the 20th century is provided by a reviewand analysis of six crucial periods in the evolution of the organization of the executive branch ofgovernment: the founders and the political theory that informed their organizationaldecisions in 1789 ; the interplay of the president and congress in executive organizationalmanagement during the 19th century ; the progressive movement of the 20th century's first decades and its continuinglegacy ; the rise and decline of "orthodoxy" in organizational management of theexecutive branch ; the interregnum period ( 1972-1992 ) with its doctrinal heterodoxy ; and the emergence of a new public management paradigm and itscritics .
the landmark commissionapproach clearly emphasizes institutional issues and will concentrate on structural changes resultingfrom the commissions' recommendations and subsequent implementation .
it is recognized , however,that the term "reorganization" covers much more than structural changes .
laws may be passed toachieve policy or enforcement objectives and indirectly reorganize internal department and agencystructure in the process .
