over the past 40 years , many countries have replaced lower - denomination notes with coins as a means to provide a financial benefit to their governments .
the federal reserve noted that it believes our 30-year estimate may overstate the net financial benefit to the government because it ( 1 ) does not adequately address the costs to the private sector , state and local government , and the federal reserve and ( 2 ) does not consider potential increases in the cost of raw material for coins or possible future changes in discount rates .
we then used this updated 30-year estimate to address your request that we provide the specific benefit or loss to the government for each of the first 10 years for our 30-year analysis ; the net benefit or loss to the government over 10 years if the interest savings due to seigniorage is excluded from the analysis ; and the net benefit or loss to the government over 10 years if the replacement ratio is 1 coin to 1 note , rather than 1.5 coins for 1 note , as we assumed in our 30-year analysis .
we have reported five times over the past 22 years that replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would provide a net benefit to the federal government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
