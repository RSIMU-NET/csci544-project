we interviewed officials from federal agencies with responsibilities related to emergency communications and procurement of lmr equipment , including dhs ; the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) and the national institute of standards and technology within the department of commerce ; the federal communications commission ( fcc ) ; the general services administration ( gsa ) ; the office of management and budget ( omb ) ; and administrators of the ecpc .
in this report , we examine: ( 1 ) lmr systems and devices used by selected federal agencies and the state of lmr interoperability among these agencies ; ( 2 ) factors that help and hinder interoperability among agencies that use lmr ; and ( 3 ) selected agencies' practices for procuring lmr systems .
in dhs's technical comments , officials stressed that interoperability is achieved by strong leadership and governance structures ; planning and coordination ; common policies and procedures that promote interoperability across agencies and jurisdictions ( e.g. , mutual aid agreements , joint procurement policies that ensure equipment is interoperable ) ; regular training and exercises that allow responders to practice interoperability skills ; and the purchase of standards - based equipment .
