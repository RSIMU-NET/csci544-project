my testimony today will focus on our prior work and discuss ( 1 ) factors that have affected gipsa's ability to investigate concerns about anticompetitive practices , ( 2 ) gipsa's actions to address our recommendations and areas where their efforts have fallen short , and ( 3 ) challenges and other issues we believe gipsa should consider as it moves to further strengthen its capacity to address competitiveness issues .
within usda , the grain inspection , packers and stockyards administration ( gipsa ) is responsible for administering the packers and stockyards act and investigating concerns about unfair and anticompetitive practices in the $90 billion livestock market .
a more recent oig report shows that , in several key areas , gipsa still has not taken sufficient steps to address those recommendations .
usda concurred with our findings and noted specific actions it planned to take in response to our recommendations , including ( 1 ) formalizing consultations between gipsa and ogc on complex investigations , and integrating ogc attorneys into its investigative teams ; ( 2 ) developing a tiered process whereby routine investigations would be reviewed and approved by headquarters staff , while complex investigations received an additional ogc review ; ( 3 ) adopting relevant procedures used by doj and ftc for planning , developing , implementing , and reviewing investigations ; and ( 4 ) reporting publicly on changing business practices and activities that raise fairness and competition concerns .
