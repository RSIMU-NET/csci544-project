specifically , my testimony ( 1 ) discusses the likely fiscal impacts of royalty relief for leases issued under the deep water royalty relief act of 1995 and ( 2 ) describes other authorities for granting royalty relief that could further impact future royalty collections .
oil and gas production from federal lands and waters is vital to meeting the nation's energy needs , supplying about 35 percent of all the oil and about 25 percent of all the natural gas produced in the united states in fiscal year 2005 .
first , mms's failure to include price thresholds for leases issued in 1998 and 1999 along with current attempts to renegotiate these leases have created uncertainty about which leases will ultimately receive relief .
gao has expressed similar concerns , and the u.s. comptroller general has highlighted royalty relief as an area needing additional oversight by the 110th congress .
in fiscal year 2006 , oil and gas companies received over $77 billion from the sale of oil and gas produced from federal lands and waters , and the minerals management service ( mms ) , the department of the interior's ( interior ) agency responsible for collecting royalties , reported that these companies paid the federal government about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties .
