to help ensure that decision makers and congress have the necessary information to provide effective oversight of dod's civilian workforce and that the strategic workforce plan can be used effectively , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness align dod's strategic workforce plan with the budget and management workforce initiatives , such as those to address recruiting , retention , and readiness issues associated with declining morale among its civilian workforces .
current budget and long - term fiscal pressures necessitate that federal government agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , operate more strategically and efficiently than ever before , and this includes cost - effective management of human - capital policies and practices .
through greater alignment , dod can help to better ensure that its strategic workforce plan appropriately addresses the human - capital challenges of the future and better contributes to the agency's efforts to meet its missions and goals .
our assessment of dod's fiscal years 2013-2018 strategic workforce plan found that dod's plan addresses 8 and partially addresses 19 of the 32 statutory requirements .
