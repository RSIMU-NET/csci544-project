on june 11 , 2009 , in response to the global spread of a new strain of influenza , the world health organization ( who ) raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6 , which indicates the start of an actual pandemic .
this change reflects the spread of the new influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus , not its severity .
the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) has often been described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 .
although currently the pandemic is of moderate severity with the majority of patients experiencing mild symptoms and making a rapid and full recovery , this experience could change .
it provides broad nondiscrimination protection in employment , public services , public accommodation and services operated by private entities , transportation , and telecommunications for individuals with disabilities .
as stated in the act , the ada's purpose is "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. .
the application of the ada to an influenza pandemic is uncharted territory since the most recent previous influenza pandemic was in 1969 , before the 1990 enactment of the ada , and before the 1973 enactment of section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 , which was the model for the ada .
