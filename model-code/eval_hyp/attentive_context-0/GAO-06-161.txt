since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the administration and congress have increased funding in support of combating terrorism both at home and abroad .
between fiscal years 2002 and 2005 , funding attributed to homeland security activities increased 39 percent , from $33 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $46 billion for fiscal year 2005 .
according to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , combating terrorism includes efforts to secure the homeland ( that is , homeland security activities to detect , deter , protect against , and , if needed , respond to terrorist attacks occurring within the united states ) and those to combat terrorism overseas ( those activities occurring outside the united states and its territories ) , excluding direct military action .
dhs officials also reported facing similar challenges .
however , omb is no longer required to report on overseas combating terrorism funding data .
for fiscal year 2006 , the president requested nearly $50 billion for activities associated with homeland security .
among these other challenges was the difficulty the executive branch faced in measuring the effective use of funds for combating terrorism since clearly defined federal and national performance objectives and measures for assessing programs' progress had not been established .
