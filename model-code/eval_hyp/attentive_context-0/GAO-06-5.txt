our objectives in this study were to: ( 1 ) describe experts' views about the potential effects of services offshoring on the u.s. economy , workforce , national security , and consumer privacy ; ( 2 ) describe the types of policies that have been proposed in response to offshoring ; and ( 3 ) discuss areas where further research could advance the debate on offshoring .
although “offshoring” has existed for decades in the manufacturing sector , recently concerns have been raised about the emergence of services offshoring .
third , the report highlights some key areas where additional research might advance the debate about the effects and policy implications of offshoring .
we have identified four areas of concern about the potential impacts of offshoring: potential impacts on the average u.s. standard of living , including average wages ; employment and job displacement among american workers ; the distribution of income ; and national security and consumer privacy .
moreover , various pieces of federal and state legislation have been introduced , such as bills to restrict the offshoring of some government services or to provide more assistance for displaced workers .
advances in information technology ( it ) and developments in the management of business processes , coupled with a large pool of educated workers in other countries , allow companies to move services work outside of the u.s. as part of a larger trend toward global interdependence .
