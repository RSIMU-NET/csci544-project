although the social security administration ( ssa ) originally created ssns as a means to track worker's earnings and eligibility for social security benefits , over time the ssn has come to be used for a myriad of purposes .
my remarks today will focus on describing ( 1 ) public and private sector use and display of ssns and ( 2 ) ssa's role in preventing the proliferation of false identities .
although congress has passed a number of laws to protect the security of personal information , the continued use of and reliance on ssns by private and public sector entities and the potential for misuse underscores the importance of identifying areas that can be further strengthened .
for example , ssa now requires field staff to independently verify the identity information and immigration status of all noncitizen applicants with the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , prior to issuing an ssn .
following the events of september 11 , 2001 , ssa formed a task force to address weaknesses in the enumeration process and developed major new initiatives to prevent the inappropriate assignment of ssns to noncitizens , who represent the bulk of new ssns issued by ssa's 1,333 field offices .
