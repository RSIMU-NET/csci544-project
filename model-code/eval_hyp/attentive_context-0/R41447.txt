whether it was the manner in which a new constitution was supposedly approved or the provisions of the elections laws , several members of congress and the obama administration have been critical of the process by which burma's ruling military junta , the state peace and development council ( spdc ) , plans on conducting the election .
the election has opened debates about u.s. policy towards burma , including questions about whether the largely isolationist policy of the past 20 years , marked by extensive economic sanctions against the regime for its human rights violations , has been effective in encouraging political change and improving the government's treatment of the burmese people ; whether the obama administration's decision to engage the burmese government can be effective ; and whether sanctions are sufficiently strict and sufficiently well - enforced to pressure the junta to improve its human rights policies .
the pending parliamentary elections in burma — to be held on november 7 , 2010 — sparked controversy even before the date was set .
as the election moves into its campaign phase , there continue to be signs that the results are unlikely to be free and fair , and may not reflect the political wishes of the burmese people .
