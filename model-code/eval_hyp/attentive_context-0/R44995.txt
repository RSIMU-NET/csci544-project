congress has shaped u.s. engagement with niger and the u.s. military footprint in the country through its authorization and appropriation of funding for u.s. security cooperation and assistance programs , and through its authorization of funding for u.s. military construction .
on october 4 , four members of u.s. special operations forces were killed and two wounded in an attack near the town of tongo tongo in western niger ( figure 1 , below ) .
congressional committees of jurisdiction have also influenced u.s. policy and programs in niger through oversight activities , for example probing the capacity of fragile states such as niger to absorb u.s. counterterrorism assistance and directing dod to seek to mitigate associated risks ( see " for what purposes are u.s. military personnel in niger ? .
the defense department ( dod ) has stated that the u.s. servicemembers were "conducting an advise and assist mission" to conduct reconnaissance with nigerien counterparts , several of whom were also killed and injured .
for many members of congress , the incident has thrown a spotlight on evolving security threats in west africa's central sahel region , as well as the growing presence of u.s. military forces engaged in counterterrorism support in africa and throughout the world .
