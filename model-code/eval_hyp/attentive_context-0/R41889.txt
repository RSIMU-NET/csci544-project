additional issues for congress concerning the climate negotiations in general , and the gcf in particular , may include the means to establish a more desirable form of agreement ( or lack thereof ) ; the compatibility of any international agreement with u.s. domestic policies and laws ; the adequacy of appropriations and fiscal incentives to achieve any commitments under the agreement ; and any requirements for potential ratification and implementing legislation , should a formal treaty emerge from the negotiations .
potential authorizations and appropriations for the gcf would rest with several committees , including the u.s. house of representatives committees on foreign affairs ( various subcommittees ) ; financial services ( subcommittee on international monetary policy and trade ) ; and appropriations ( subcommittee on state , foreign operations , and related programs ) ; and the u.s. senate committees on foreign relations ( subcommittee on international development and foreign assistance , economic affairs , and international environmental protection ) ; and appropriations ( subcommittee on state , foreign operations , and related programs ) .
many voices , domestic and international , have called upon the united states and other industrialized countries to increase foreign assistance to lower - and middle - income countries to address climate change .
