the process of resolving the legislative differences that arise between the house of representatives and the senate is one of the most critical stages of the legislative process .
each chamber continues to be governed by its own rules , precedents , and practices , but at this stage , each house also must take into account the preferences and , to some extent , the procedures of the other .
readers may wish to study the provisions of the rules — especially house rule xxii — and examine the applicable precedents as explained in house practice: a guide to the rules , precedents , and procedures of the house , especially pages 339-374 ( on "conferences between the houses" ) and pages 857-883 ( on "senate bills ; amendments between the houses" ) , and in riddick's senate procedure ( senate document no .
it may serve as a useful introduction or general guide , but it should not be considered an adequate substitute for a study of house and senate rules and precedents themselves or for consultations with the parliamentarians of the house and senate on the meaning and possible application of the rules and precedents .
