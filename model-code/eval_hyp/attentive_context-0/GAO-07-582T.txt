in justifying much of the $5.8 billion in its supplemental fiscal year 2007 security forces fund request and its fiscal year 2008 security forces fund request , dod has pointed out that without the funds designated for mod and moi logistics and sustainment functions the coalition would have to continue to support the isf .
the national strategy implies a conditions - based linkage between the development of the isf , including its logistical and other support capabilities , and the size and shape of the u.s. presence in iraq .
while in iraq we met with officials from the department of state , office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) , multi - national force - iraq , multi - national corps - iraq , and multi - national security transition command - iraq .
in november 2005 , the national security council issued the national strategy for victory in iraq , which states that the coalition will adjust its “posture and approaches as conditions evolve and iraqi capabilities grow,” and that coalition troop levels in iraq will decrease over time as the iraqis take on more responsibilities for themselves .
in its next report to congress , issued in may 2006 , dod stated that more than 65 percent of personnel in the iraqi army's support forces had been trained and equipped and that logistics units were continuing to increase in capability .
