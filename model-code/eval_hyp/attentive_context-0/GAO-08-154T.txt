we are pleased to be here today to testify on the results of our review of the centers for medicare & medicaid services' ( cms ) audit activities related to medicare advantage ( ma ) organizations that was mandated by the balanced budget act ( bba ) of 1997 .
according to cms , in fiscal year 2006 , over 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries — or about 7 million of the approximately 43 million — were enrolled in a medicare advantage plan .
specifically , we will tell you about: the adjusted community rate proposal ( acrp ) and bid process and the related audit requirement for organizations that participate in the medicare advantage program , cms' efforts to comply with the audit requirement for organizations' acrp and bid submissions , and factors that cause cms' audit process to be of limited value .
we also recommended that cms amend its implementing regulations for the medicare advantage program and prescription drug program to provide that all contracts cms enters into with ma organizations and prescription drug plan sponsors include terms that inform these organizations of the audits and give cms authority to address identified deficiencies , including pursuit of financial recoveries .
