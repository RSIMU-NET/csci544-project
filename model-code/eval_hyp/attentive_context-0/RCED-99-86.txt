reflecting congressional interest in brownfields , you asked us to ( 1 ) compare federal agencies' planned financial assistance to brownfields , as stated in the partnership agenda , to their actual spending for brownfields in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 ; ( 2 ) describe the purposes of these obligations ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which agencies met the partnership's goals and objectives .
since the early 1990s , federal , state , and local governments have focused much attention on the cleanup and economic redevelopment of “brownfields” — abandoned , idle , or underused industrial and commercial facilities where real or perceived environmental contamination is a barrier to redevelopment .
in some cases , rather than face the potentially high costs to clean up the contamination at brownfields and any future liability for it , businesses have looked to greenfields — undeveloped sites in rural and suburban areas — for expansion and new development .
under the partnership initiative , more than 20 federal agencies were to better coordinate their brownfield resources and activities , specifically carrying out more than 100 action items involving brownfields that would , among other things , generate $469 million in federal financial assistance — $304 million predominantly in grants to local communities , and $165 million in loan guarantees .
