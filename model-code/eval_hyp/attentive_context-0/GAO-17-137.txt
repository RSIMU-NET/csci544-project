for this review , we assessed ( 1 ) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and the potential effects of any certification delays on nasa's access to the iss ; ( 2 ) the major programmatic and safety risks facing the program and the contractors ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the program has visibility into the contractors' efforts .
in order to ensure that the united states has continued access to the iss if the commercial crew program's contractors experience additional schedule delays , we recommend the nasa administrator develop a contingency plan for maintaining a presence on the iss beyond 2018 , including options to purchase additional russian soyuz seats , and report to congress on the results .
