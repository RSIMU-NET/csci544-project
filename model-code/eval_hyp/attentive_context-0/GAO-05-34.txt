for more than a decade , the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) hubble space telescope has provided unique images of the universe and has given scientists critical data needed to help understand a number of space mysteries .
hubble's continued operation has been dependent on nasa's space shuttle fleet , which carried crewmembers to the telescope to perform periodic maintenance and upgrades .
this report addresses the basis for nasa's cost estimates to ( 1 ) service the hubble telescope by using the shuttle and ( 2 ) implement the caib's recommendations , including those recommendations directly related to safely returning the shuttle to flight .
nasa has now begun to explore the costs and benefits of various servicing alternatives , including robotic servicing , which should enable nasa to make a more informed decision regarding hubble's future .
however , nasa's decision has prompted considerable debate .
the grounding of the shuttle fleet following the tragic loss of space shuttle columbia in february 2003 put these missions to hubble on hold , and in january 2004 , nasa announced its decision to cancel the fifth and final planned hubble servicing mission .
