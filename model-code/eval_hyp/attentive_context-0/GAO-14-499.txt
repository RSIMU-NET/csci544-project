this report examines ( 1 ) how and why the estimated cost and schedule for the u.s. iter project have changed since 2006 ; ( 2 ) the reliability of doe's current cost and schedule estimates for the u.s. iter project and the factors , if any , that have affected their reliability ; and ( 3 ) the actions doe has taken , if any , to reduce u.s. iter project costs and plan for their potential impact on the overall u.s. fusion program .
our review assessed: ( 1 ) how and why the estimated cost and schedule for the u.s. international thermonuclear experimental reactor ( iter ) project have changed since 2006 ; ( 2 ) the reliability of the department of energy's ( doe ) current cost and schedule estimates for the u.s. iter project and the factors , if any , that have affected their reliability ; and ( 3 ) the actions doe has taken , if any , to reduce u.s. iter project costs and plan for their potential impact on the overall u.s. fusion program .
continue to formally advocate for the timely implementation of those actions at each future iter council meeting until the iter council approves an updated international project schedule ; once the iter organization completes its reassessment of the international project schedule , use that schedule , if reliable , to propose a final , stable funding plan for the u.s. iter project , approve a performance baseline with finalized cost and schedule estimates , and communicate this information to congress ; and set a specific date for completing , in a timely manner , a strategic plan for the u.s. fusion program that addresses doe's priorities for the overall u.s. fusion program in light of u.s. iter project costs , and involve the fusion energy sciences advisory committee in the development of the plan .
