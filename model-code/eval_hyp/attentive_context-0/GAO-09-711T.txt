today , i will discuss ( 1 ) current jsf cost and schedule estimates ; ( 2 ) issues concerning the alternate engine program ; ( 3 ) manufacturing performance ; ( 4 ) contracting issues for procurement of production aircraft ; and ( 5 ) development test plans .
dod concurred .
the jsf is the department of defense's ( dod ) most costly acquisition program , seeking to simultaneously develop , produce , and field three aircraft variants for the air force , navy , marine corps , and eight international partners .
our most recent report in march of this year discussed increased development costs and schedule , plans to accelerate procurement , manufacturing performance and delays , and the development test strategy .
dod's 2010 budget request did not include this funding .
the jsf is critical to our nation's plans for recapitalizing the tactical air forces and will require a long - term commitment to very large annual funding outlays .
a recurring theme in our work has been concern about what we believe is undue concurrency of development , test , and production activities and the heightened risk it poses to achieving good cost , schedule , and performance outcomes .
