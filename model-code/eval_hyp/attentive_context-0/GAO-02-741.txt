as requested , we assessed ( 1 ) whether treasury had a statutory veto over the use of ex - im bank's tied aid capital projects fund , ( 2 ) what the principles were for using tied aid , and ( 3 ) how ex - im bank and treasury applied these principles .
tied aid is government - to - government concessional financing of public sector capital projects in developing countries that is linked to the procurement of goods and services from the donor country .
it stated that ( 1 ) its july 2001 agreement with treasury on a new set of principles and procedures for administration of the tied aid credit program and ( 2 ) the signing into law of its reauthorization legislation , which modified its relationship with treasury , had made the findings of this report not relevant to its future administration of the program .
you expressed concern about the nature of treasury's authority over the use of tied aid and the underlying reasons for ex - im bank and treasury's differences .
the export - import bank ( ex - im bank ) provides assistance to u.s. exporters facing foreign competitors supported by tied aid .
