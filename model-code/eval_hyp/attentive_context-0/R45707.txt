the original tria legislation's stated goals were to ( 1 ) create a temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured terrorism losses to allow the private market to stabilize ; ( 2 ) protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks ; and ( 3 ) preserve state regulation of insurance .
estimates of insured losses from the 9 / 11 attacks are more than $45 billion in current dollars , the largest insured losses from a nonnatural disaster on record .
bills to expand tria were resisted by then - president george w. bush's administration , and previous presidential budgets under then - president obama called for changes in the program that would have had the effect of scaling back the tria coverage .
for example , although the april 2013 bombing in boston was termed an "act of terror," by the president , the insured losses in tria - eligible insurance from that bombing did not cross the $5 million statutory threshold to be certified under tria .
these losses were concentrated in business interruption insurance ( 34% of the losses ) , property insurance ( 30% ) , and liability insurance ( 23% ) .
