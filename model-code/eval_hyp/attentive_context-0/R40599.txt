by some estimates , identity fraud cost americans nearly $21 billion in 2012 .
identity theft , for one , poses both security and economic risks .
federal trade commission ( ftc ) complaint data indicate that the most common fraud complaint received ( 18% of all consumer fraud complaints ) is that of identity theft .
this is an increase from the approximately 11.6 million who were victimized in 2011 and 10.2 million who were victimized in 2010 .
federal law enforcement is thus challenged with investigating criminals who may or may not be operating within u.s. borders ; may have numerous identities — actual , stolen , or cyber ; and may be acting alone or as part of a sophisticated criminal enterprise .
consequently , policymakers may debate the federal government's role in preventing identity theft and its related crimes , mitigating the potential effects of identity theft after it occurs , and providing the most effective tools to investigate and prosecute identity thieves .
policymakers continue to be concerned with securing the economic health of the united states — including combating those crimes that threaten to undermine the nation's financial stability .
