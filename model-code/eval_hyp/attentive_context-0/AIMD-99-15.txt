this letter presents the results of our review of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) physical controls over receipts and taxpayer data .
as reported in our audit of irs' fiscal year 1997 custodial financial statementsand in subsequent congressional hearings on irs financial management issues , irs' internal controls at service centers were not adequate to sufficiently ensure that cash and checks received from taxpayers were properly credited to taxpayers' accounts and deposited to the department of the treasury general fund .
to follow up on these weaknesses and to assess physical security conditions at irs during the peak filing season , we observed physical controls over receipts and taxpayer data at service centers and district offices in april 1998 as part of our ongoing audit of irs' fiscal year 1998 financial statements .
we further reported that these control weaknesses and inherent vulnerabilities expose irs and taxpayers to losses .
this report discusses additional internal control weaknesses over the safeguarding of receipts and taxpayer data that we identified in april 1998 and provides our recommendations for improvement .
however , no changes have yet been implemented .
in fiscal year 1997 , irs collected more than $1.6 trillion in tax revenue .
