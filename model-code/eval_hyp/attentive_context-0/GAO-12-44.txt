this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent are transportation stakeholders satisfied with the quality of the transportation security administration's ( tsa ) transportation security - related information products ? .
because tsa has not clearly defined and documented roles and responsibilities for disseminating security - related information and the full range of its information - sharing efforts , tsa may not be consistently providing security - related information products to external stakeholders and divisions within tsa may not be held fully accountable for performing their information - sharing activities .
given that dhs's current outreach efforts have not resulted in widespread hsin - cs awareness and use among transportation stakeholders , additional actions to improve system awareness and accessibility will help ensure that transportation security information users receive timely and useful security information .
 .
the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( 9 / 11 commission act ) directed dhs to create a transportation security information sharing plan ( tsisp ) , which was first issued in july 2008 and most recently updated in december 2010 and is designed to establish a foundation for sharing transportation security - related information between public and private entities that have a stake in protecting the nation's transportation system .
