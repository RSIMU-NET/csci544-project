the first part of the transition period extends from election day through the meeting of the electoral college , which , for the 2016 election , takes place on december 19 .
for instance , the period between president barack h. obama's election to a second term on november 6 , 2012 , and his inauguration on january 20 , 2013 , was not a transition period as defined in this report .
presidential transitions in the past half - century have generally been characterized by high levels of activity and frequent improvisation as the president - elect's team works to finalize personnel and policy arrangements for the incoming administration within a period of just over 10 weeks .
the three - to - four month period of the presidential general election campaign , from the national party conventions through election day , and the 10-week transition period , from election day to the january 20 inauguration , present a different range of succession issues concerning presidential and vice presidential nominees during the campaign and the president - and vice president - elect during the transition .
in the event there is neither a president nor a vice president , the presidential succession act provides that the speaker of the house of representatives , the president pro tempore of the senate , and duly - confirmed cabinet officers , in order of the seniority of their departments , would be eligible to act as president .
