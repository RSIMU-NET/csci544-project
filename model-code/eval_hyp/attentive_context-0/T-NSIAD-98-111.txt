in relation to those responsibilities , i will also discuss the recent competition for c - 5 aircraft workload and our assessment of it ; the adequacy of dod's support for its determination that competing combined , rather than individual workloads of each maintenance depot is more logical and economical ; and concerns participants have raised about the upcoming competitions for the workloads at the air logistics centers in sacramento , california , and san antonio , texas .
first , i will address the problems we are having in obtaining access to department of defense ( dod ) information that we need regarding these competitions to meet our reporting responsibilities under the 1998 defense authorization act .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to the public - private competitions for workloads at two maintenance depots identified for closure during the 1995 base realignment and closure process .
716 .
as a result of a 1995 defense base closure and realignment commission decision , kelly air force base , texas , is to be realigned and the san antonio air logistics center , including the air force maintenance depot , is to be closed by 2001 .
