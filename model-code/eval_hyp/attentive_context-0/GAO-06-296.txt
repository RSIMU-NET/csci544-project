visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) is a multibillion - dollar program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) that is intended to record the entry into and exit from the united states of selected individuals , verify their identity , and confirm their compliance with the terms of their admission into and stay in the united states .
the goals of the program are to ( 1 ) enhance the security of our citizens and visitors , ( 2 ) facilitate legitimate travel and trade , ( 3 ) ensure the integrity of the u.s. immigration system , and ( 4 ) protect the privacy of our visitors .
our objective was to determine the progress of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) in implementing 18 of our recommendations pertaining to the u.s .
dhs agreed to implement all 18 recommendations .
of these 18 , dhs has completely implemented 2 , has partially implemented 11 , and is in the process of implementing another 5 .
the current status of dhs's implementation of our 18 recommendations on program risks is mixed , but progress in critical areas has been slow .
