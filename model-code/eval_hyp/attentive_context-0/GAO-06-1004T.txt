to understand more fully how this strategy might contribute to better protection of ip , i will address three topics: ( 1 ) the range and effectiveness of multi - agency efforts on ip protection that preceded stop ; ( 2 ) initial observations on the organization and efforts of stop ; and ( 3 ) initial observations on the efforts of u.s. agencies to prevent counterfeit and pirated goods from entering the united states , which relate to one of stop's goals .
these include ( 1 ) a study that we have initiated for this committee focusing on ip enforcement at the u.s. border , ( 2 ) a study for the house government reform committee on interagency efforts to protect ip rights , and ( 3 ) additional work on a customs and border protection ( cbp ) program called the “in - bond system” that allows goods to enter u.s. commerce at a port other than the port of arrival .
thank you for the opportunity to appear again before the subcommittee to discuss our work on u.s. efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property ( ip ) rights .
the united states dominates the creation and export of intellectual property — creations of the mind — and provides broad protection for intellectual property through means such as copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
