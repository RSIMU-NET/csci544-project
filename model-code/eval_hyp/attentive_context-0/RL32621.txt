some argue further that — since asylum is a discretionary form of immigration relief — national security risks should outweigh humanitarian concerns , and thus asylum relief should be restricted and judicial review of asylum cases more limited .
some have long been concerned that terrorists would seek asylum in the united states , hoping to remain hidden among the hundreds of thousands of pending asylum cases .
critics point to asylum seekers from countries of "special concern" ( i.e. , saudi arabia , syria , iran , north korea , china , pakistan , egypt , lebanon , jordan , afghanistan , yemen and somalia ) as potential national security risks .
although uscis and eoir are clearly the lead agencies in asylum policy , the first contacts many asylum seekers have with the u.s. government are with customs and border protection ( cbp ) inspectors , border patrol officers , and immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) agents , whom some maintain are not adequately trained in asylum policy and other humanitarian forms of immigration relief .
others point out that asylum seekers are subject to multiple national security screenings and that — if an asylum seeker is a suspected or known terrorist — the law already bars alien terrorists .
