fmcsa currently posts most of the scores publicly on its website for use by industry stakeholders and the public.fmcsa has indicated that a future rulemaking will include some of the information used to calculate sms scores to help determine a carrier's overall fitness to operate motor vehicles .
among these activities are new entrant safety audits and identification , or vetting , of “chameleon” carriers — motor carriers that have registered and been operating illegally in interstate commerce by using a new identity in an effort to disguise their former identity and evade enforcement actions issued against them by fmcsa .
fmcsa has taken actions to address our recommendations related to the vetting of chameleon carriers ; however , it has not taken action to address our recommendations to better account for limitations in the csa program .
the precision and accuracy of these scores is vital because fmcsa investigators and their state partners use sms results to focus their resources on higher risk carriers and , through interventions , help reduce the number of motor carrier crashes , injuries , and fatalities .
the commercial motor carrier industry is large and diverse , with more than 500,000 active motor carriers operating on u.s. roadways .
