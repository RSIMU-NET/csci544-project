we make the following two recommendations to va: the under secretary for health should ensure that any action plan for achieving health equity includes key elements for successful implementation by consistently applying criteria identified in gao's past work on effectively managing performance , including developing performance measures to assess progress and creating clear lines of accountability by designating specific offices or officials with responsibility for coordinating efforts to implement actions and committing resources necessary for achieving its goals and objectives .
until va resolves known weaknesses with the completeness and accuracy of its race and ethnicity data , it will be limited in its ability to assess health equity for veterans receiving care at its facilities .
 ( recommendation 1 ) to ensure the availability of information on health care outcomes by race and ethnicity throughout the va health care system , the secretary of veterans affairs should conduct an assessment to determine the completeness and accuracy of race and ethnicity data captured in va's electronic health record , and implement corrective actions as necessary to resolve any identified deficiencies .
 ( recommendation 2 ) .
in addition , to examine va's efforts to use race and ethnicity data to research and address disparities in health care outcomes involving minority veterans , we compared va's efforts to the recommendations made by the 2016 commission on care report , which advised va to increase the availability , quality , and use of race , ethnicity , and language data .
