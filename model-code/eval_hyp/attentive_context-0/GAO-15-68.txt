this report examines ( 1 ) the impact of allowing majority - owned portfolio companies to participate in agency sbir programs and ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies have elected to expand their sbir programs to include majority - owned portfolio companies .
starting in 2013 , implementation of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 ( ndaa ) enabled agencies to allow small businesses that are majority owned by multiple venture capital operating companies , hedge funds , or private equity firms ( majority - owned portfolio companies ) to participate in the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program .
pursuant to the ndaa , the written determination must explain how the use of the authority to allow such companies to participate in the sbir program will ( 1 ) induce additional venture capital , hedge fund , or private equity firm funding of small business innovations ; ( 2 ) substantially contribute to the agency's mission ; ( 3 ) demonstrate a need for public research ; and ( 4 ) otherwise fulfill the capital needs of small business concerns for additional financing for sbir projects .
sba is not responsible for encouraging or discouraging agencies to use the new authority and expand eligibility to include majority - owned portfolio companies , but sba , as the program administrator , could be missing an opportunity to help agencies better understand the evidence required for the written determination , which could inform agencies' decisions about whether to expand their program .
