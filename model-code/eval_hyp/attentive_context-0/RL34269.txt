congress and the federal communications commission ( fcc ) have a history of supporting programs that foster diversity of broadcast station ownership , in general , and minority and female ownership , in particular , as a means to achieve that goal .
diversity of viewpoint has long been a primary goal of u.s. communications policy .
the new data may be used to aid the fcc in deciding whether and to what extent programs to increase minority and female ownership should be implemented .
on may 5 , 2009 , the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nprm ) seeking comment on methods to improve the agency's data regarding minority and female ownership of broadcast properties .
the courts have reinforced the notion that minority ownership is a valid concern that should be addressed by the fcc when constructing its media ownership rules , but also have set restrictions on how programs can be structured to foster that goal .
the fcc is under judicial mandate to consider how its ownership rules will affect minority ownership of broadcast stations .
also , two bills were introduced in the 110 th congress that would have revived a tax incentive to aid certain businesses seeking to acquire telecommunications , including broadcast , properties .
