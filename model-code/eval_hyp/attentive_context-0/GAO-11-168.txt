to better understand the implications of moving to the new strategy , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine whether irs has identified the expected benefits of cade 2 and set targets for measuring success , ( 2 ) examine the estimated costs of the program and assess irs's process for developing them , and ( 3 ) assess irs's process for managing the risks associated with cade 2 and describe the risks irs has identified using this process .
as agreed , our objectives were to 1. determine whether the internal revenue service ( irs ) has identified the expected benefits of customer account data engine ( cade ) 2 and set targets for measuring success , 2. examine the estimated costs of cade 2 and assess irs's process for 3. assess irs's process for managing the risks associated with cade 2 and describe the risks irs has identified using this process .
in administering federal tax laws , the internal revenue service ( irs ) collected approximately $2.35 trillion in 2010 and is projected to collect over $3 trillion beginning in 2013 .
we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue direct the appropriate officials to take the following five actions: to provide a better basis for measuring cade 2 performance in achieving ts1 benefits , set the remaining quantitative targets where feasible as soon as possible in 2011 ; in conjunction with developing the approach for ts2 expected in may 2011 , finalize the phase's expected benefits , set quantitative targets where feasible , and identify how related systems and business processes might be affected ; and to ensure the revised estimates for cade 2 are credible , include inflation when calculating costs , include the costs irs explicitly excluded or provide a rationale for excluding them , and include any business costs associated with moving to daily processing or document that these costs were excluded and provide a rationale for excluding them .
