to address your request , we assessed ( 1 ) the interim results of irs's 2006 filing season performance compared to prior years ; ( 2 ) irs's budget request compared to prior years ; and ( 3 ) how the budget helps irs achieve its long - term goals aimed at reducing the tax gap .
since the passage of the internal revenue service ( irs ) restructuring and reform act of 1998 ( rra 98 ) , irs has made noticeable improvements to taxpayer services such as telephone assistance and delivered some modernized information systems that , among other benefits , speed up refunds to taxpayers .
irs has also increased revenue collected through its enforcement programs ; however , tax law enforcement continues to be included on our list of high - risk federal programs .
increased funding financed some of the improvements , but a significant portion has been financed internally through efficiencies from increased electronic filing of tax returns and other operational improvements .
after late payments by taxpayers and revenue brought in by irs's enforcement efforts , the resulting net tax gap is estimated to be $290 billion .
irs estimated the gross tax gap to be $345 billion for tax year 2001 .
