this report provides our observations on the general services administration's ( gsa ) fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan , dated march 5 , 1998 , that was submitted to congress as required by the government performance and results act of 1993 ( results act ) .
to do our review , we used the criteria in the results act ; the office of management and budget's ( omb ) guidance on developing the plan ( circular a - 11 , part 2 ) ; our february 1998 guidance for congressional review of the plans ( gao / ggd / aimd 10.1.18 ) ; our evaluator's guidance for assessing annual performance plans ( gao / ggd - 10.1.20 ) ; and the december 17 , 1997 , letter to the omb director from several congressional leaders .
these requesters were the speaker of the house ; the house majority leader ; and the chairmen of the house committees on the budget , appropriations , and government reform and oversight .
however , for the remaining 22 performance goals , 16 lack measures and targets needed to gauge performance ; and 6 had a mix of some quantifiable measures and some still under development or had measures that are not specific enough to gauge performance .
