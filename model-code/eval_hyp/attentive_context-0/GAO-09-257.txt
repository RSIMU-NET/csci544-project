gao was asked to examine ( 1 ) dndo's progress in developing programs to address critical gaps in preventing nuclear smuggling domestically , ( 2 ) dndo's role in supporting other agencies' efforts to combat nuclear smuggling overseas , and ( 3 ) the amount budgeted by dhs , dod , doe , and state for programs that constitute the global nuclear detection strategy and the extent to which the budget information is used for planning purposes .
maritime detection efforts pose unique technological and operational challenges .
it also has made some progress in developing and supporting initiatives to close these gaps .
dndo has collected these data since 2006 .
however , remaining challenges are great , funding is uncertain , time frames are unclear , and the technology may not be available any time soon to bridge some of these vulnerabilities .
develop criteria to assess the effectiveness , cost , and feasibility of the maritime radiological and nuclear pilot program .
should the decision be made to expand the maritime radiological and nuclear program beyond the pilot , undertake additional planning to identify next steps , including how and where a broader strategy would be implemented , what technology would be needed , what organizations should be involved , and how such efforts would be sustained .
