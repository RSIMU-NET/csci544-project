the conference agreement on the appropriations bill provides $436.6 billion in new appropriations for defense , including $366.6 billion in regular appropriations and $70 billion in additional appropriations as a "bridge fund" for operations abroad and for some other purposes .
the senate approved the agreement on september 29 by a vote of 100-0 , and the president signed the bill into law , p.l .
109-364 , on october 17 .
the senate also added $1.8 billion for border security , $700 million for counter drug operations in afghanistan , $200 million for enhanced intelligence to track down osama bin laden , $65 million for predator uavs , $20 million for peacekeepers in sudan , and $175 million for wildfire suppression .
but the white house threatened to veto the bill if it trimmed defense by more than $4 billion as a means of providing additional funds for non - security - related programs .
the senate - passed bill provided $9 billion less than the request , which , in turn , allowed increases above the administration request in non - defense appropriations while remaining within the budget resolution cap on total discretionary spending .
