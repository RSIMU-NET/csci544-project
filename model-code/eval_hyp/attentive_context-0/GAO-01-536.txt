since its inception in 1978 , the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) science advisory board has reviewed key scientific studies and methodologies used by the agency in formulating rules to protect the environment and public health .
as agreed with your office , we determined whether the policies and procedures of the board are adequate to ensure that ( 1 ) its peer review panelists are independent and the panels are properly balanced and ( 2 ) the public is sufficiently informed about the points of view represented on the panels .
the evaluation should include explicitly discussing with potential panelists ( 1 ) items not adequately reported on the confidential financial disclosure form as well as items reported that could present conflicts of interest ; ( 2 ) other information relevant to assessing impartiality , such as research conducted and previous public statements or positions on the matter being reviewed , interest of the employer or clients in the matter , participation in legal proceedings , work for chemical companies or other affected industries , and prior or current research grants that could be affected by the matter ; and ( 3 ) whether they have any potential conflicts of interest related to the specific panel being established .
