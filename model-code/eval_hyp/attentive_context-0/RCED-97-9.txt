to provide you with an early snapshot of states' interest in establishing sibs , you asked that we ( 1 ) identify the extent of states' interest in the pilot program and how states might use sibs and ( 2 ) identify the benefits and barriers to states' using sibs .
total public spending on the capital needs for highways and bridges was approximately $40 billion in 1993 , the most recent year for which data are available .
for instance , the national highway system designation act of 1995 provided a number of innovative financing mechanisms , including the authorization of a state infrastructure bank ( sib ) pilot program for up to 10 states .
to address these questions , we used a structured questionnaire to interview ( 1 ) transportation officials from 15 states that generally had expressed an interest to dot in innovative financing — 6 of which had been selected to participate in the sib pilot program — and ( 2 ) various financial representatives , such as firms that rate bonds' risk and financial condition .
postponing investment can increase costs ; dot estimates that deferring $1 in highway resurfacing for just 2 years can require spending $4 in highway reconstruction costs to repair the damage .
