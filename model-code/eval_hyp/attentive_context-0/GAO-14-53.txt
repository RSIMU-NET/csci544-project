to examine the effects of continuous health insurance coverage before medicare ( our independent variable of interest ) on beneficiaries' health status , spending , and use of services ( our dependent variables of interest ) , we used data from the health and retirement study ( hrs ) and medicare claims .
this report compares ( 1 ) the health status of medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before enrollment and ( 2 ) the spending and use of services by medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before enrollment .
therefore , for these analyses , we defined three distinct groups of beneficiaries who were in ( 1 ) their first and second years of medicare , ( 2 ) their third and fourth years of medicare , and ( 3 ) their fifth and sixth years of medicare from 2001 through 2010 ( see fig .
this suggests that the extent to which individuals enroll in private insurance before age 65 has implications for beneficiaries' health status and medicare spending .
nearly 7 million individuals aged 55 to 64 , the pre - medicare population , lacked health insurance coverage in the first half of 2012 , accounting for more than 18 percent of this population .
