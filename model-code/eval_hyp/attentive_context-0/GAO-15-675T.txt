the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments , which often suffered from ineffective management , and spending on it operations is inefficient .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent designation of information technology ( it ) acquisitions and operations as a government - wide high - risk area , as well as the impact of recently enacted federal it acquisition reform legislation ( commonly referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act or fitara ) .
from october 2009 through december 2014 , we made 737 recommendations to address weaknesses in agencies' it management .
as you know , the effective and efficient acquisition and management of it investments has been a long - standing challenge in the federal government .
my statement today will discuss this high - risk designation , as well as plans for implementing fitara and those plans' impact on it acquisition reform .
in light of these ongoing challenges , we recently added improving the management of it acquisitions and operations to our list of high - risk areas for the federal government .
the recent it reform legislation holds promise for improving agencies' acquisition of it , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) is developing guidance for agencies to implement its provisions .
