in recent years , the department of defense ( dod ) has become increasingly concerned about its ability to retain enough personnel to fulfill its missions and is particularly concerned about retaining personnel who possess specialized skills .
widespread reports of flagging military morale raise an important question: is dissatisfaction with the military way of life driving highly trained individuals out , or are they being lured away by more favorable civilian opportunities ? .
we focused our analysis on three areas: ( 1 ) what were the expectations and experiences of enlisted personnel , ( 2 ) how satisfied were they with military life and what were their career intentions , and ( 3 ) what were their perceptions of civilian work opportunities and quality of life .
dod officials attribute retention problems in certain occupations to factors such as the growth of civilian job opportunities , the negative impact of increasing military operations , and servicemembers' concerns over benefits and quality - of - life conditions .
human capital management is not only a problem for dod , but as we have reported , it is also an area of concern throughout the federal government today .
