in recent years , the social security administration ( ssa ) has had difficulty ensuring that people receiving disability benefits under the disability insurance ( di ) program are eligible for benefits .
such management includes ( 1 ) monitoring the disability status of all beneficiaries to help ensure program integrity and ( 2 ) helping as many beneficiaries as possible to become self - sufficient by determining their vocational rehabilitation ( vr ) service needs and providing them assistance to enter or reenter the workforce .
specifically , we are providing information on ( 1 ) the number and characteristics of individuals who are due for cdrs , ( 2 ) how ssa selects individuals for and conducts cdrs , ( 3 ) whether available resources are adequate for conducting required cdrs , and ( 4 ) what potential options exist for improving the cdr process .
ssa is required by law to conduct periodic examinations , called continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) , to determine whether a beneficiary has medically improved to the extent that the person is no longer considered disabled .
information is included about databases used in estimating for the di and ssi programs the number of beneficiaries due or overdue for a cdr in fiscal year 1996 and analyzing their characteristics .
