the department of the interior is responsible for diverse and complex missions ranging from managing america's public lands , mineral and water resources , and wildlife to providing satellite data to the military and scientific communities .
to fulfill these responsibilities , interior invests over $850 million annually — about 6 percent of its total annual budgetary resources — in communications and computing projects and systems .
as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to evaluate ( 1 ) departmental capabilities for managing the agency's information technology ( it ) investments , including its ability to effectively oversee bureau processes , and ( 2 ) the department's actions and plans to improve these capabilities .
the secretary of the interior and interior's chief information officer ( cio ) are responsible for overseeing processes for managing these investments at all levels of the organization to ensure that funds are expended in the most cost - effective way in support of the agency's mission needs .
between 1995 and 2001 , we reported on interior's efforts to acquire a land and mineral case processing system called automated land and mineral record system ( almrs ) / modernization and raised concerns about the bureau of land management's ( blm ) and the prime contractor's abilities to complete , integrate , and test the new software system and complete the current schedule .
