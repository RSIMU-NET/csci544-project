further , in january 2017 , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the hhs agency that administers medicare , issued its opioid misuse strategy for the medicaid and medicare programs , including medicare part d. the strategy includes the agency's plans to address concerns about beneficiary use of opioids and the prescribing of opioids by providers .
accordingly , this testimony focuses on ( 1 ) how cms oversees beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under medicare part d , and ( 2 ) how cms oversees providers who prescribe opioids to medicare part d beneficiaries .
misuse of prescription opioids , which are used to treat both acute and chronic pain , has become a serious public health problem for the u.s. population , including medicare beneficiaries .
because neither the oms criteria nor the patient safety measures include all beneficiaries potentially at risk of harm from high opioid doses , we recommended that cms should gather information over time on the total number of beneficiaries who receive high opioid morphine equivalent doses regardless of the number of pharmacies or providers , as part of assessing progress over time in reaching the agency's goals related to reducing opioid use .
