the objectives of this review were to ( 1 ) assess the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement procurement oversight , and ( 2 ) identify dhs components' use of strategic sourcing to leverage their buying power .
in order to help ensure that dhs component officials understand what ocpo expects of them in its procurement oversight , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the chief procurement officer to review and ensure consistency between directive 143-05 and the procurement oversight program guidebook and with the department's current procurement oversight efforts .
accordingly , we ( 1 ) assessed dhs's efforts to implement procurement oversight , and ( 2 ) identified dhs components' use of strategic sourcing to leverage their buying power .
to assess dhs's efforts in implementing procurement oversight , we reviewed procurement oversight policies and guidance ; interviewed knowledgeable officials from ocpo and dhs components ; reviewed prior gao reports ; and examined dhs and component documentation of oversight efforts , including ocpo's review schedule , quarterly reports , goal letters , and on - site reviews from 2007 to the present .
