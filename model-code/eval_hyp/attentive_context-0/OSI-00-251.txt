identifying the extent of improper payments and their causes , including those attributable to potential fraud and abuse , are the first steps toward implementing the most cost - effective ways to reduce losses .
to demonstrate a commitment to improving payment safeguards , in january 2000 , hcfa reaffirmed its goal of reducing the medicare fee - for - service payment errors to 5 percent or less by the year 2002 , about a 3 percent or $5 billion reduction from fiscal year 1999 levels .
given the importance of medicare to millions of beneficiaries and concerns about the financial health of the program , you asked us to provide suggested improvements to assist hcfa in its efforts to further estimate medicare improper payments , including potential fraud and abuse .
in summary , we concluded that because it was not intended to include procedures designed specifically to identify all types of potential fraudulent and abusive activity , the current methodology does not provide an estimate of the full extent of improper medicare fee - for - service payments ; hcfa has initiated three projects designed to further its measurement efforts which offer some promise for determining the extent of improper payments attributable to potential fraud and abuse ; and based on careful evaluation of their effectiveness , performing additional potential fraud identification techniques as part of its efforts to measure improper payments could assist hcfa in arriving at a more comprehensive measurement and , ultimately , develop cost - effective internal controls to combat improper payments ; however , no set of techniques , no matter how extensive , can be expected to measure all potential fraud and abuse .
