the 112 th congress continued to take a strong interest in the health of the u.s. research and development ( r&d ) enterprise and in providing support for federal r&d activities .
some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal funding in light of the current federal fiscal condition , deficit , and debt .
congress plays a central role in defining the nation's r&d priorities as it makes decisions with respect to the size and distribution of aggregate , agency , and programmatic r&d funding .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease .
low or negative growth in the overall r&d investment may require movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities .
however , widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions involving prioritization of r&d within the context of the entire federal budget and among competing priorities within the federal r&d portfolio .
