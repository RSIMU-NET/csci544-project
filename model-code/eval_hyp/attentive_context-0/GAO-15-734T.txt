blm faces a number of decisions about its continued implementation of the act , including decisions related to its upcoming fiscal year 2016 helium auction and sale .
auction and sales held during the summer of 2014 , ( 2 ) blm's administration of the act's tolling provision , and ( 3 ) upcoming decisions blm faces as it continues implementing the act .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our april 2015 report regarding the department of the interior's ( interior ) bureau of land management's ( blm ) implementation of the helium stewardship act of 2013 .
as a result of this finding , we recommended that the secretary of the interior direct the director of blm to assess auction methods based on revenue generation , using available information , and select a method that would maximize revenue for the upcoming helium auction .
we reviewed two sources of updated information from june 2015 that interior provided us: a federal register notice stating blm's proposal for the fiscal year 2016 helium auction and sale , and a letter from interior to us containing the department's response to the recommendations in our april 2015 report .
