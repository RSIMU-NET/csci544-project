the power of congress and the executive branch to legislate and implement the conditions for admitting aliens into the united states and permitting them to remain is so broad as to be virtually immune from judicial control .
however , this power is still subject to constitutional limitations , including substantive and procedural due process protections .
however , in the wake of u.s. supreme court decisions construing the administrative procedure act ( apa ) as applying to and providing an avenue for judicial review of immigration adjudications , congress amended the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) of 1952 by adding a judicial review provision in 1961 that provided for review of deportation orders by federal courts of appeals , but only for habeas corpus review of exclusion orders by federal district courts .
concerns about the growing population of undocumented aliens , fraudulent asylum claims , terrorism threats , and crimes of drug , human , and arms trafficking , led to legislation in 1996 and 2005 that limited judicial review , including the availability of habeas corpus proceedings .
in deciding what degree of judicial review is appropriate in immigration matters , congress has sought to balance judicial review between fairness to desired immigrants ( workers , family , refugees / asylees ) and facilitation of the removal of detrimental aliens ( national security risks / terrorists , criminals , public charges ) .
