this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional committees' requests for scientific advice from the sab ensure compliance with erddaa ; ( 2 ) the extent to which casac has provided advice related to naaqs ; and ( 3 ) policies , if any , epa has to ensure the sab and casac maintain their independence from the agency when performing their work .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) uses scientific studies and methodologies when formulating rules to protect the environment and public health .
epa's written procedures for processing congressional committee requests to the sab are found in the sab charter and in the following two documents that establish general policies for how epa's federal advisory committees are to interact with outside parties: epa policy regarding communication between members of federal advisory committee act committees and parties outside of the epa ( the april 2014 policy ) , and clarifying epa policy regarding communications between members of scientific and technical federal advisory committees and outside parties ( the november 2014 policy clarification ) .
however , shortcomings exist with epa's policy documents .
the sab , its staff office , and casac report directly to the epa recent interactions between the house committee on science , space , and technology and the sab related to specific sab reviews on hydraulic fracturing and water body connectivity have raised questions with the committee regarding whether the sab is fulfilling its statutory obligations to provide scientific advice to the designated congressional committees.in addition , recent testimony received by the committee has raised questions regarding whether casac is carrying out its statutory obligations to advise epa of any adverse public health , welfare , social , economic , or energy effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of naaqs .
