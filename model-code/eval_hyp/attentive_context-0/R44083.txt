the appointments clause ( article ii , section 2 ) empowers the president to nominate and , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , to appoint the principal officers of the united states , as well as some subordinate officers .
specifically , the appointments clause provides that [the president] shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the supreme court , and all other officers of the united states , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law .
the constitution divides the responsibility for populating the top positions in the federal government between the president and the senate .
congress has created many such positions in statute .
officers of the united states are those appointees who are "exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states" ( emphasis added ) .
the report begins by explaining the three distinct stages that comprise the advice and consent process , which is the means through which most of these positions are filled .
