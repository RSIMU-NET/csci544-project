to help ensure that the corps and fema carry out the national levee - safety - related activities required in the water resources reform and development act of 2014 , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to direct the chief of engineers and commanding general of the u.s. army corps of engineers and that the secretary of homeland security direct the fema administrator to develop a plan , with milestones , for implementing these activities , using existing resources or requesting additional resources as needed .
levees — man - made structures such as earthen embankments or concrete floodwalls — play a vital role in reducing the risk of flooding , and a levee's failure can lead to the loss of lives or property .
to examine the progress that the corp and fema have made in carrying out key national levee - safety - related activities under the water resources reform and development act of 2014 , we reviewed pertinent federal laws and executive orders , including the water resources reform and development act of 2014 ; the water resources development act of 2007 ; the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ; executive order 11988 , floodplain management ; and executive order 13690 , establishing a federal flood risk management standard and a process for further soliciting and considering stakeholder input .
