to improve va's testing of veterans identified as at risk of hepatitis c infection , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for health to determine the effectiveness of actions taken by networks and facilities to improve the hepatitis c testing rates for veterans and , where actions have been successful , consider applying these improvements systemwide and provide local managers with information on current fiscal year performance results using a subset of the performance measurement sample of veterans in order for them to determine the effectiveness of actions taken to improve hepatitis c testing processes .
to be included in the hepatitis c testing performance measure , the veteran does not have to have been tested in fiscal year 2002 ; testing may have occurred in a prior fiscal year .
va's hepatitis c screening performance result for fiscal year 2002 was 85 percent , a significant improvement from its baseline result of 51 percent in fiscal year 2001 .
primary care providers and clinicians in network 5's three facilities offered two reasons that hepatitis c tests were not ordered for over two - thirds of the veterans identified as at risk but not tested for hepatitis c in the network 5 fiscal year 2002 performance measurement sample .
