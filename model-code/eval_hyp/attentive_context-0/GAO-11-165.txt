as dod implements our june 2008 recommendation to regularly hold meetings with high - level federal officials of the full economic adjustment committee , as dod agreed to do in concurring with our recommendation , we further recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense ( acquisition , technology , and logistics ) to routinely coordinate with the secretary of transportation to ( 1 ) meet regularly , ( 2 ) identify all existing federal transportation funding resources , and ( 3 ) develop a strategy for affording priority consideration for the use of those funds and other resources for the benefit of communities most severely affected by dod .
the recent concurrent implementation of numerous department of defense ( dod ) initiatives — including the 2005 base realignment and closure ( brac ) round , force structure increases for the army and the marine corps under the grow the force initiative , a major army reorganization known as force modularity and the redeployment of u.s. forces in overseas locations back to the united states under the global defense posture realignment — has resulted in anticipated and actual growth at many domestic military installations and has produced a concomitant increase in unmet transportation needs in many surrounding communities .
