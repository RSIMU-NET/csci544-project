medicaid , a federal - state health financing program for low - income and medically needy individuals , served approximately 65 million beneficiaries at a total cost of about $508 billion in fiscal year 2014 .
our analysis consisted of the following three steps: ( 1 ) state selection , which included assessing data reliability for our selected states ; ( 2 ) beneficiary and service identification ; and ( 3 ) utilization calculation .
as medicaid spending and enrollment grew in recent years , states increasingly turned to the managed care delivery model as a way to provide services to medicaid beneficiaries .
radiology: across all selected states , utilization of radiology ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 times greater for child beneficiaries enrolled for 1 to 3 months than for full - year child beneficiaries .
analyses of beneficiaries' service utilization could enhance program knowledge and serve as a baseline for future analyses of trends in utilization over time and of the factors that may contribute to differences across states .
managed care and fee - for - service ( ffs ) are two possible models that states use to deliver benefits under their medicaid programs .
