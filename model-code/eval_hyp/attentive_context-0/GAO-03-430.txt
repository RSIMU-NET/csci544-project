gao was asked to ( 1 ) describe the two departments' processes for implementing their programs , ( 2 ) identify the costs and types of treatments implemented , and ( 3 ) determine whether these treatments are effective .
the department of the interior ( interior ) and the department of agriculture's ( usda's ) forest service — the two departments that manage most federal land — spend millions of dollars annually on such treatments .
in order to better ensure that funds for emergency stabilization and rehabilitation treatments on burnt lands are used as effectively as possible , we recommend that the secretaries of agriculture and of the interior require the heads of their respective land management agencies to specify the type and extent of monitoring data that local land units are to collect and methods for collecting these data , and develop an interagency system for collecting , storing , analyzing , and disseminating information on monitoring results for use in management decisions .
both interior and usda's forest service use multidisciplinary teams of experts , such as ecologists and soil scientists , to assess damage and potential risks burnt land poses and to develop emergency stabilization and rehabilitation plans that identify needed treatments to reduce or eliminate those risks .
