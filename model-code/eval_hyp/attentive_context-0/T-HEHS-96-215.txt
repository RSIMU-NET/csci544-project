the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) now estimates that 4.3 million medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) , and enrollment is growing at a rate of about 100,000 new members per month .
second , through its medicare peer review organization ( pro ) program , hcfa collects and evaluates performance indicators for certain procedures or diseases to assess hmo performance .
this statement relies on two of our recent reports , titled medicare: federal efforts to enhance patient quality of care ( gao / hehs - 96-20 , apr .
10 , 1996 ) , health care reform: “report cards” are useful but significant issues need to be addressed ( gao / hehs - 94-219 , sept. 29 , 1994 ) , and other past reports on related issues .
as a result , stakeholders are interested in programs that protect consumers from cost reduction strategies that might adversely affect their health care .
we have also included information drawn from the results of a 1996 report of 384 u.s. employers surveyed by watson wyatt , a benefits consulting group , and the washington business group on health ( wbgh ) .
