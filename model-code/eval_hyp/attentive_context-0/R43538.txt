ongoing congressional interest in the professional experiences of judicial nominees reflects , in part , the evaluative role of congress in examining the qualifications of those who are nominated by the president to life - tenure positions .
specifically , this report provides statistics and analysis related to ( 1 ) the percentage of active circuit court judges with judicial experience , as well as the type of judicial experience ; ( 2 ) the percentage of active circuit court judges with private practice experience , as well as the length of time of such experience ; and ( 3 ) the percentage of active circuit court judges by professional experience immediately prior to their appointment to a circuit court judgeship .
this report provides an analytic overview of the professional experiences and qualifications of those individuals who are currently serving as active u.s. circuit court judges .
for example , one study found that prior judicial experience for u.s. circuit court judges did not influence variation in judicial decision making in terms of the extent a judge voted in a consistent ideological fashion ( such prior experience might have been hypothesized to be a source of consistency in judicial voting ) .
