on march 1 , 2007 , the department of defense ( dod ) reported that over 24,000 servicemembers have been wounded in action since the onset of the two conflicts .
specifically , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the transition of care for seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers — those with traumatic brain injuries or other complex trauma , such as missing limbs — who are transferred between dod and va medical facilities ; ( 2 ) dod's and va's efforts to provide early intervention for rehabilitation services as soon as possible after the onset of a disability for seriously injured servicemembers ; ( 3 ) dod's efforts to screen oef / oif servicemembers at risk for ptsd and whether va can meet the demand for ptsd services ; and ( 4 ) the impact of problems related to military pay on injured servicemembers and their families .
the departments established joint programs to facilitate the transfer of injured servicemembers from dod facilities to va medical facilities , assess whether servicemembers will be able to remain in the military , and assign va social workers to selected mtfs to coordinate the transfers .
