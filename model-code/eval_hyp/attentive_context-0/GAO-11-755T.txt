the acts generally require the smithsonian institution and federal agencies to take certain actions to identify the indian and native hawaiian human remains and cultural objects in their collections , affiliate those remains and objects to a tribe , and upon request repatriate the items to the tribes .
furthermore , while national nagpra has taken several actions to implement the act's requirements , in some cases it has not effectively carried out its responsibilities .
as we reported , the committee's recommendations to facilitate the resolution of disposition requests involving culturally unidentifiable human remains have generally been implemented ( 52 of 61 requests has been fully implemented ) .
these human remains and cultural objects have long been a concern for many indian tribes and native hawaiian communities , who have been determined to provide an appropriate resting place for their ancestors .
