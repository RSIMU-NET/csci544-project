in the absence of such clarity , chevron instructs reviewing courts to defer to an agency's construction of an ambiguous statute if the agency's interpretation is reasonable .
often , however , congressional delegations of authority are imprecise , and , as a result , agencies must construe ambiguous terms and make interpretive decisions in order to implement congress's delegation .
this report will discuss the chevron decision ; explain when chevron deference applies ; highlight common agency statutory interpretations that generally do not receive deference under chevron ; and review the recent supreme court opinion in city of arlington v. fcc which clarified the applicability of chevron deference to circumstances in which an agency is interpreting the scope of its own jurisdiction .
under chevron then , it is generally left to federal agencies , and not the courts , to resolve ambiguities necessary to interpret and implement authority provided to the agency by congress .
the chevron test , which has been cited and followed thousands of times by federal courts since 1984 , requires courts to enforce the clearly expressed intent of congress .
an administrative agency may generally only exercise that authority which is provided to it by congress .
