i will focus on ( 1 ) how medicare determines the labor cost adjustment for hospitals in an area ; ( 2 ) whether medicare's labor cost adjustment accounts appropriately for geographic variation in wages paid by hospitals ; ( 3 ) the extent to which geographic reclassification addresses potential problems with medicare's labor cost adjustment for hospitals ; and ( 4 ) how medicare determines geographic adjustments to physician fees .
because medicare's hospital and physician payment systems are based on national rates , these geographic cost adjustments are essential to account for costs beyond providers' control and to ensure that beneficiaries have adequate access to services .
some providers contend that medicare's geographic cost adjustments are inadequate .
if these adjustments are not adequate , medicare could financially reward or penalize providers due only to where they are located .
similarly , physicians have raised concerns about the appropriateness of medicare's geographic adjustment to their fees .
over time , this could affect some providers' financial stability and their ability or willingness to continue serving medicare patients .
but concerns remain about the geographic variation in payments to hospitals and disparities in hospital financial performance under medicare's hospital payment system .
