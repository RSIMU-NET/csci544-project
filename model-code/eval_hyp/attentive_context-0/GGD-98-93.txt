in order to gain an understanding of the initial effects of this reduction , we reviewed four major federal departments to ( 1 ) describe the activities they have undertaken in restructuring personnel offices and operations ; ( 2 ) ascertain what , if any , performance measures are in place to gauge results of the restructuring efforts ; and ( 3 ) identify issues agencies may commonly encounter when , in restructuring their personnel operations , they consider outsourcing automated personnel and / or payroll services to another agency or the private sector .
in addition , the national performance review ( npr ) , now called the national partnership for reinventing government , in 1993 , recommended that agencies reduce by half the costs of administrative positions , including personnel positions , by 1999 .
congress has made it clear , through enactment of a statutory framework with the government performance and results act of 1993 as its centerpiece , that it expects agencies to improve their accountability for resources , including human resources , in accomplishing agency missions .
resource reductions and changing missions , coinciding with the replacement of aging human resource management information systems , are driving efforts in federal agencies to restructure their personnel offices .
