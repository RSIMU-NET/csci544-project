the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is the federal agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical products , including drugs and biological products .
regardless of whether a postmarketing study has been required or requested by fda , sponsors conducting such studies must comply with provisions in the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 ( fdama ) and implementing regulations to report annually to fda on the status of postmarketing studies .
before a new drug can be marketed in the united states , a drug sponsor must demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use , and obtain approval from fda .
regarding its enforcement of postmarketing study requirements , we found fda has not fully utilized its available enforcement tools , even when sponsors have failed to complete required studies .
if fda determines that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks , it may approve the sponsor's application to market a new drug .
this problem is not new .
recently , concerns have surfaced about some drugs which fda approved based on surrogate endpoints .
