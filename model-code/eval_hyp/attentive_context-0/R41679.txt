this framework , which is grounded in federal statute and regulations , determines the following: 1. who is responsible for paying for oil spill cleanup costs ; 2. who is responsible for paying for economic and natural resource damages associated with an oil spill ; 3. how these costs and damages are defined ( i.e. , what is covered ) ; and 4. the degree to which ( or conditions in which ) the costs and damages are limited and / or shared by other parties , including general taxpayers .
an issue that has generated ( and to some degree continues to generate ) particular interest is the oil spill liability and compensation framework .
on april 20 , 2010 , the deepwater horizon oil drilling rig was nearing completion of bp's deepwater oil well when an uncontained release of hydrocarbons ( oil and natural gas ) caused explosions and fire , resulting in 11 crew member fatalities .
in its 2010 financial statement , bp estimated the combined oil spill costs — cleanup , natural resource and economic damages , potential clean water act ( cwa ) penalties , and other obligations — will be approximately $41 billion .
