socom has encountered difficulties over the past several years with two of its flagship acquisition programs â€” the advanced seal delivery system ( asds ) and the cv - 22 advanced vertical lift aircraft .
the special operations command ( socom ) was established in 1987 to oversee the training , doctrine , and equipping of all u.s. special operations forces ( sof ) .
socom has committed about $6 billion to date on these programs .
both the asds and cv - 22 programs have experienced significant cost , schedule , and performance problems because of requirements , technology , and design issues .
in light of socom's expanded acquisition duties , congress requested that gao review socom's management of its acquisition programs .
socom has undertaken a diverse set of acquisition programs since january 2001 that are consistent with the command's mission to address unique sof needs and those needs for which there are no service - common requirement .
the other 35 ( 40 percent ) of socom's 86 programs have experienced or are likely to experience modest to , in a number of cases , significant cost increases and schedule delays due to a range of technical , programmatic , or funding issues .
