ntbs had fully implemented three of our management recommendations as of our last report in april 2008 â€” our recommendations to ( 1 ) facilitate communication from staff to management , ( 2 ) align organizational structure to implement a strategic plan , and ( 3 ) correct an antideficiency act violation related to purchasing accidental death and dismemberment insurance for employees on official travel .
our testimony addresses ntsb's progress in ( 1 ) following leading practices in ment , management areas such as strategic planning , human capital manage information technology ( it ) , and financial management ; ( 2 ) increasing the efficiency of activities related to investigating accidents , issuing recommendations , and conducting safety studies ; and ( 3 ) increasing the use of its training center .
as the share of federal resources used to address the nation's long - term fiscal imbalance and other national priorities grows , funding for increases in the budgets of individual agencies becomes more uncertain .
in 2006 , we conducted a broad review of the agency's management practices , examined how it carried out its activities related to accident investigations and safety studies , and analyzed whether its training center was cost - effective .
