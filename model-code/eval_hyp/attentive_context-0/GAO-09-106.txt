the objectives for this engagement were to determine ( 1 ) what is known about the processing times for claims under the whistleblower statutes that the department of labor ( labor ) administers and the factors that affect processing times , ( 2 ) what the outcomes were of those complaints , and ( 3 ) what key challenges labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) faces in administering the program .
audits lack independence .
audit guidance is unclear .
audits are central to any internal control and accountability process and , while some progress has been made to enhance its audit program , more needs to be done to bring it in line with government auditing standards .
we further recommend that the secretary of labor direct the arb to conduct routine , systematic , independent reviews of its case tracking system in order to ensure that it has accurate and reliable information to use to monitor the program .
the whistleblower protection program at the department of labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) is responsible for receiving and investigating most whistleblower complaints .
since the whistleblower program began in 1970 , the number of statutes for which osha is responsible for enforcing whistleblower provisions has increased â€” recent additions in 2008 bring the total to 17 such statutes .
