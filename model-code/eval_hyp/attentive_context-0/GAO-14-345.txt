the objectives of our review were to: ( 1 ) determine the extent to which the mine safety and health administration ( msha ) used recent coal workers' pneumoconiosis ( cwp ) trend data as a basis for its proposed exposure limit on coal mine dust , and ( 2 ) obtain experts' views on ways to lower the level of dust in coal mines , including their associated advantages , disadvantages , and cost .
in may 2013 , you requested that we conduct an additional analysis of the data msha used to support its proposal and provide information on existing technologies that could be used to reduce dust levels in coal mines .
in october 2010 , the department of labor's ( dol ) mine safety and health administration ( msha ) — the federal agency responsible for setting and enforcing mine safety and health standards — proposed lowering the existing concentration limit for respirable coal mine dust from 2.0 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air ( mg / m ) to 1.0 mg / m in commenting on the proposed rule , representatives of the coal mining industry raised concerns about the feasibility and cost of reducing respirable coal mine dust concentrations to the proposed limit of 1.0 mg / m consistent with this requirement , in august 2012 , we issued a report in which we assessed the strengths and limitations of the data and the analytical methods msha used to support its proposal to lower the exposure limit for coal mine dust .
