i appreciate the opportunity to testify today on progress made by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in implementing key provisions of the faa modernization and reform act ( the 2012 act ) .
my statement today is based on work on these issues we have completed for the subcommittee since passage of the 2012 act , including ( 1 ) implementing nextgen , ( 2 ) improving aviation safety , particularly with respect to implementing provisions of the 2012 act related to faa's certification processes , and ( 3 ) integrating uas into the nas .
in addition , given the potential opportunities afforded by new unmanned aircraft systems ( uas ) , the 2012 act included several provisions with respect to faa safely integrating uas into the national airspace system ( nas ) .
the u.s. air transportation system is the busiest and among the safest in the world , with key aviation stakeholders — faa , the airlines and other aircraft operators , airports , aircraft manufacturers , and others — working together to achieve these results .
this change has not been fully implemented by faa .
consistent with issues raised in our 2010 report , this committee identified three root causes of inconsistent interpretation of regulations: ( 1 ) unclear regulatory requirements ; ( 2 ) inadequate and nonstandard faa and industry training in developing regulations , applying standards , and resolving disputes ; and ( 3 ) a culture that includes a general reluctance by both industry and faa to work issues of inconsistent regulatory application through to a final resolution and a “fear of retribution.” to address these root causes , the committee made six recommendations , including developing a master source of guidance and developing instructions for faa staff with policy development responsibility .
