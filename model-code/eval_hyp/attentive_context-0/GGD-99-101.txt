also , as agreed with you , we categorized the assistance into three types: ( 1 ) direct funding or grants ; ( 2 ) access to support services and systems , such as the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) national crime information center ; and ( 3 ) in - kind ( no cost ) transfers of equipment or other assets .
specifically , for fiscal years 1996 through 1998 , you requested that we identify the types and amounts of such assistance provided by the department of justice , the department of the treasury , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) .
although states and localities have traditionally held the major responsibility for preventing and controlling crime in the united states , a significant aspect of the federal government's role has been its provision of financial and other assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies .
this report responds to your request for information about crime technology assistance provided by the federal government to state and local law enforcement agencies .
however , to help ensure data quality , among other steps , we ( 1 ) obtained information on and reviewed the processes used by agency officials to calculate the estimated amounts of crime technology assistance and ( 2 ) compared agency responses to primary source documents and attempted to reconcile any differences with agency officials .
