to assess the department of state's ( state ) progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts since 2006 and the effect of any remaining gaps , we reviewed gao and state office of inspector general reports ( oig ) , as well as applicable legislation and budget documents ; analyzed staffing , bidding , and position data ; and interviewed officials in state's bureau of human resources , bureau of consular affairs , and six regional bureaus regarding staffing issues .
