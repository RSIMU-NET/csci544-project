mippa required us to conduct a study of the lvpa.the committees of jurisdiction , this report: ( 1 ) examines the design of the adjustment and the extent to which it targeted low - volume facilities that appeared necessary for ensuring access to care and had high costs ; and ( 2 ) examines how cms implemented the lvpa , including the extent to which cms paid the 2011 adjustment to facilities that were eligible to receive it .
to ensure that future lvpa payments are made only to eligible facilities and to rectify past overpayments , we recommend that the administrator of cms take the following four actions: require medicare contractors to promptly recoup 2011 lvpa payments that were made in error ; investigate any errors that contributed to eligible facilities not consistently receiving the 2011 lvpa and ensure that such errors are corrected ; take steps to ensure that cms regulations and guidance regarding the lvpa are clear , timely , and effectively disseminated to both dialysis facilities and medicare contractors ; and improve the timeliness and efficacy of cms's monitoring regarding the extent to which medicare contractors are determining lvpa eligibility correctly and promptly redetermining eligibility when all necessary data become available .
