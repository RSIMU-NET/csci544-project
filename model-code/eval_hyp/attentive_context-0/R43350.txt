for much of u.s. history , alcohol excise taxes have served as one means to help fund emergency levels of spending ( such as during wartime ) and to reduce rising budget deficits ( such as in 1990 ) .
alcohol excise taxes in the united states have a history almost as old as the federal government itself , as alcohol taxes were among some of the first federal revenue sources in the early republic .
fourth , alcohol excise taxes are analyzed with a particular focus on market structure , the effects of alcohol excise taxes on negative spillover effects from alcohol consumption , and how the distribution of these excise taxes affect various measures of equity in the federal tax code .
the modern - day interest in alcohol taxes is broad , with arguments presented to either raise or decrease current alcohol excise tax rates .
various approaches could be taken , such as follows: increasing excise taxes could serve as a source of revenue as part of a larger budget deficit reduction package or as an offset , reducing excise taxes could benefit firms in the alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry , or increasing excise taxes could discourage the negative spillover effects associated with alcohol consumption ( health , safety , crime , etc. ) .
