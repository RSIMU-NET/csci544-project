in my testimony , i will describe the competitive implications of the proposed alliances , including ( 1 ) their potential benefits to consumers , ( 2 ) their potential harm to consumers , and ( 3 ) the issues that policymakers need to consider in evaluating the net effects of the proposed alliances .
because of their concerns over the potential anticompetitive impacts of these proposed alliances , the departments of justice ( doj ) and transportation ( dot ) are reviewing them , and you and other members of congress have announced your intention to review them as well .
our prior work has shown that the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 has generally been successful , resulting in lower fares and better service for most air travelers , largely because it increased competition , with both the entry of new airlines into the industry and the movement of established airlines into new markets .
these include whether the alliances may exacerbate or ameliorate fare and service problems being reported by business travelers and certain small and medium - sized communities ; the impact that the proposed alliances may have on international travelers ; and , should some combination or all of the proposed alliances go forward , the overall implications for competition in the airline industry from this substantial restructuring .
