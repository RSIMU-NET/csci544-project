as congress looks toward potentially reauthorizing the tanf program in 2012 , you asked us to address ( 1 ) how tribal tanf programs have changed since 2002 , especially in light of changing economic conditions ; ( 2 ) the challenges tribes face in administering their own tanf programs and what tribes have done to address them ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) has provided guidance and oversight to promote the integrity and effectiveness of tribal tanf programs .
for example , hhs could consider more effective ways to provide training to tribes on how new guidance or policy decisions will affect the administration of their programs , and consistently update its web site to provide information on related tribal tanf technical assistance and training .
the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) brought about significant reforms to the country's welfare system when it replaced the aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program with the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant .
to obtain information on how tribal temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) programs have changed since 2002 ( when we last reviewed the program ) , the challenges tribes face in administering their own programs and what tribes have done to address them , and federal agencies' guidance and oversight of tribal tanf programs , we analyzed federal tanf data , documents and tribal tanf single audit data collection reports for selected years ; surveyed all tribal tanf administrators ; conducted site visits at 11 tribal tanf programs in four states , and interviewed federal officials .
