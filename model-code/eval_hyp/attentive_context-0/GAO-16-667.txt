the freedom of information act ( foia ) requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to government information on the basis of the principles of openness and accountability in government .
further , congress could consider amending the act to require justice to reflect in its litigation and compliance reports , changes in the award of attorneys' fees and costs resulting from the appeals process and settlement agreements between agencies and plaintiffs , if deemed to be cost - effective .
in addition , the act states that the court may assess against the government reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs incurred in a foia lawsuit if the requester has obtained relief through either a judicial order , or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree ; or a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency , if the plaintiff's claim is not insubstantial .
our objective was to determine the freedom of information act ( foia ) litigation - related costs incurred by federal agencies for lawsuits in which the plaintiff substantially prevailed .
for example , it has developed guidance for ensuring timely determinations on requests ; expediting the processing of requests ; and reducing backlogs .
