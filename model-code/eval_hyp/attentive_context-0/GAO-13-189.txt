our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the status of renewable energy permitting on federal land , including time frames for processing permits applied for since epact 2005 ; ( 2 ) actions the agencies have taken to facilitate renewable energy development on federal land , particularly since the passage of epact 2005 ; and ( 3 ) factors affecting renewable energy development on federal land .
concerns over reliance on imported oil and greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels to generate power have increased interest in producing electricity from renewable sources , including wind , solar , and geothermal energy .
factors facilitating the permitting process include coordination among the involved parties and resources the agency can devote to permitting ; factors that may hinder or slow permitting include the quality of submitted applications and managing for the presence of natural and cultural resources on proposed development locations .
