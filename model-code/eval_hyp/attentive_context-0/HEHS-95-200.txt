our report discusses how the department of health and human services' systems for identifying health care shortage areas are currently used to target resources to the underserved , and department proposals to combine these systems .
this report was prepared at our own initiative in response to the growing number of federal programs using health care shortage areas to determine who can apply for federal assistance .
we include recommendations to the congress that could result in a better match of federal program resources to needy communities , and eliminate funding where there is not a demonstrated need for federal assistance .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) spends about $1 billion a year on programs for improving access to health care for areas with shortages of primary care physicians and health care services .
hhs has two such systems: the health professional shortage area ( hpsa ) system identifies underservice caused by a shortage of health professionals , and the medically underserved area ( mua ) system more broadly identifies areas and populations not receiving adequate health services for any reason , including provider shortages .
we reviewed the hpsa system as part of the broad federal effort to improve access to care , and as a follow - up to a congressionally mandated review of the role of federal health education and training programs in achieving this purpose .
