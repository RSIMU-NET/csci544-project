a presidential “disaster declaration” authorizes federal assistance in the affected state ( s ) ; fema determines which counties within the state will receive assistance and the type ( s ) of assistance .
specifically , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine if fema's and sba's disaster declaration policies and procedures differ for requests for rural , as compared with urban , areas ; ( 2 ) compare the length of time taken for each agency to respond to requests for rural and for urban areas ; ( 3 ) compare the proportion of requests for rural areas that were granted with the corresponding proportion for urban areas ; and ( 4 ) perform a limited number of case studies to identify factors that influence the length of time taken for the disaster declaration process .
fema's assistance is triggered if the president declares that an emergency or disaster exists and that federal resources are required to supplement state and local resources .
assistance from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and / or the small business administration ( sba ) may be provided if requested by state governors .
federal assistance authorized by the president includes assistance from other federal agencies , including sba .
