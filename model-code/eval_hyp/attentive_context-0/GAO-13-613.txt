in 2011 , medicare , the federal health program insuring 48 million people who are age 65 and older or disabled , paid about $5.7 billion to provide three outpatient therapy services — physical therapy ( pt ) , occupational therapy ( ot ) , and speech - language pathology ( slp ) — for 4.9 million beneficiaries .
as with typical prepayment manual reviews , providers had 45 days to provide documentation of medical necessity , and the macs had 60 days to review the supporting materials and notify providers and beneficiaries of their decisions .
the appeals process — which may involve five levels of review — could take more than 2 years to reach a conclusion , and any reversals of prior therapy coverage denials will affect the final outcomes of the 2012 mmr process .
in this report , we discuss ( 1 ) cms's implementation of the mmr process for outpatient therapy services conducted from october 1 , 2012 , through december 31 , 2012 , and ( 2 ) the number of individuals and claims subject to mmrs during the 3-month process and the outcomes of these reviews .
medicare spending for outpatient therapy has increased from $1.3 billion in 1999 to $5.7 billion in 2011 .
