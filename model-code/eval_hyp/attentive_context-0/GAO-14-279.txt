as cms implements and refines its physician feedback and vm programs , the administrator of cms should consider taking the following two actions to help ensure physicians can best use the feedback to improve their performance: develop performance benchmarks that compare physicians' performance against additional benchmarks such as state or regional averages ; and disseminate performance reports more frequently than the current annual distribution — for example , semiannually .
one such approach — known as value - based payment ( vbp ) — links a portion of physician compensation to achieving specified levels of performance .
increasingly , health care payers — including medicare — are rethinking the way they reimburse providers in an attempt to shift away from paying solely for the volume of care delivered and toward paying them for the value of their care .
vbp can be used as a means to improving quality and efficiency in the traditional health care delivery environment by encouraging providers to address gaps in patient care and consider the likely costs and benefits of care .
the health insurers in our review typically spent from 4 to 6 months to produce and distribute annual performance reports ; in contrast , the health care collaboratives spent 9 to 10 months .
