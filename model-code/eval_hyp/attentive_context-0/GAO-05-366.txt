in this report , we ( 1 ) identify the conditions that irf medicare patients have , the number of these patients considered to have 1 of the 13 conditions , and the number of irfs that meet the requirements of the 75 percent rule ; ( 2 ) describe how irfs assess patients for admission and whether cms reviews admission decisions ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the approach of using a list of conditions in the 75 percent rule to classify irfs .
under authority provided in the social security act , the secretary defines a rehabilitation hospital and unit .
irfs are required to assess patients prior to admission to ensure they require the level of services provided in an irf , and cms is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of individual admissions after the patient has been discharged through reviews for medical necessity conducted under contract by its fiscal intermediaries ( fi ) .
for example , although a subset of patients who have had a stroke may require the intensive level of care provided by an irf , others may be less severely disabled and require less intensive services .
medicaid services ( cms ) relies on a regulation commonly known as the “75 percent rule,” which was initially issued in 1983 and most recently revised in 2004 .
