to follow up on our november 2001 report on the executive branch's efforts in this area , you asked us to determine what rightsizing actions may be feasible to reduce costs and security vulnerabilities while retaining effectiveness in meeting foreign policy objectives .
we reviewed reports , including those of the accountability review boards , the overseas presence advisory panel ( opap ) , and a state department - led interagency rightsizing committee,and we discussed overseas staffing issues with officials from the state department , other u.s. agencies operating overseas , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) , which is currently implementing the president's management initiative to rightsize u.s. embassies .
for our purposes , we define rightsizing as aligning the number and location of staff assigned to u.s. embassies with foreign policy priorities and security and other constraints .
we selected this embassy as a case study because it is a large embassy that has been the subject of substantial rightsizing discussions , including recommendations by the former ambassador to france to reduce the number of staff in france by about one - half .
we identified three critical elements that should be evaluated together as part of this framework: ( 1 ) physical security and real estate , ( 2 ) mission priorities and requirements , and ( 3 ) operational costs .
in addition , i will briefly discuss some of the steps needed to implement the framework and the importance of developing a mechanism to move the rightsizing process forward while ensuring greater transparency and accountability in overseas staffing decisions .
we will report on this work in more detail later this year .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our ongoing work on rightsizing the u.s. overseas presence .
today i will discuss our preliminary observations on a framework for assessing the feasibility of rightsizing the u.s. overseas presence .
my testimony will also highlight staffing issues we identified at the u.s. embassy in paris .
we also performed fieldwork at the u.s. embassy in paris .
developing comprehensive cost data and linking budgets and staffing decisions are also imperative .
in response to opap's recommendations , in february 2000 , president clinton directed the secretary of state to lead an interagency effort to ( 1 ) develop a methodology for assessing embassy staffing , and ( 2 ) recommend adjustments , if necessary , to staffing levels at six pilot study embassies .
state's current mission performance plan process does not differentiate among the relative importance of u.s. strategic goals .
in addition , the president's fiscal year 2003 international affairs budget highlighted the importance of making staffing decisions based on mission priorities and costs and directed omb to analyze agencies' overseas staffing and operating costs .
however , a number of policy issues and challenges need to be addressed for this process to move forward with any real success .
although state has a multibillion - dollar plan under way to address security deficiencies around the world , security enhancements cannot bring most existing facilities in line with the desired setback and related blast protection requirements .
for instance , the executive branch needs to prioritize foreign policy goals and objectives and insist on a link between those goals and staffing levels .
