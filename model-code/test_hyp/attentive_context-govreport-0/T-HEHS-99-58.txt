specifically , you asked us to review hcfa's progress in ( 1 ) addressing its most immediate priorities and ( 2 ) strengthening its internal management to effectively discharge its major implementation and oversight responsibilities .
this legislation also established the bipartisan commission on the future of medicare to develop more long - term solutions for further ensuring medicare's integrity and solvency .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) ability to meet its new and growing responsibilities .
two of the programs hcfa administers cost federal and state taxpayers about $370 billion in fiscal year 1998 — $193 billion for medicare and $177 billion for medicaid — and represent an ever growing proportion of the federal budget — currently about 18 percent .
the balanced budget act of 1997 ( bba ) and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) were designed , with considerable input from the administration , to strengthen hcfa's ability to prevent fraud and abuse and constrain spending growth in the medicare program .
the long - term financial condition of medicare is now one of the nation's most pressing problems .
hcfa pays for health care coverage for nearly a quarter of the population .
recent legislation gave hcfa substantial new authorities and responsibilities for reforming medicare in order to extend the solvency of medicare's hospital insurance trust fund beyond 2008 .
because of your concern about hcfa's preparedness to implement these new authorities and administer its programs , you asked us to review hcfa's management capacity and to testify before this subcommittee last january .
we have also reported on management problems that have led to poor - quality care provided to vulnerable beneficiaries .
because of the size and complexity of its programs , we have been reviewing hcfa's operations since the agency was created more than 20 years ago .
it has also slowed efforts to improve the oversight of ongoing operations , such as financial management and medicare fee - for - service claims administration , which desperately need attention .
for example , it has delayed needed systems modernization and computer changes that implement new payment systems intended to slow program cost growth .
these laws added substantial new authorities and programmatic responsibilities to hcfa's ongoing management of medicare and medicaid .
you asked us to report today on our updated assessment of hcfa's progress — focusing on the agency's ability to meet its increasing workload in the short term .
over the years , we have reported on problems in hcfa's management that weakened the fiscal integrity of these programs — leading to increased monetary loss from fraud , abuse , and erroneous payments .
in 1990 , we developed a list of agencies and programs that were “high risk” because of their vulnerability to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
however , measured against the magnitude of challenges it faces , hcfa's progress seems more modest .
to further strengthen hcfa's ability to effectively manage its employees and programs , the administration has proposed new authorities for contracting and new flexibility in hiring in the president's budget for fiscal year 2000 .
