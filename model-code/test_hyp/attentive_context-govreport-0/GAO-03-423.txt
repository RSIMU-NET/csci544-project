this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent is dod participating in public - private partnerships for depot maintenance ; ( 2 ) what are the characteristics that need to be present to achieve effective partnerships , and where is dod in its ability to measure success ; and ( 3 ) what factors could affect dod's planned expansion of public - private partnerships ? .
your subcommittee has supported the use of public - private depot maintenance partnerships with its support of enabling legislation and interest in dod's use of such partnerships .
for the past several years , the department of defense ( dod ) and the congress have encouraged the defense logistics support community to pursue partnerships with the private sector .
in january 2002 , dod issued policy encouraging the use of such public - private partnerships in order to combine the best commercial processes and practices with dod's extensive depot maintenance capabilities with the objective of improving the efficiency and viability of dod's depots .
these public - private partnerships are arrangements through which the combined resources , risks , and rewards of a public agency and a private company are intended to provide greater efficiency , better access to capital , and improved compliance with a range of government regulations .
to encourage the department of defense to more clearly identify its long - term goals for its depot facilities and the role of public - private partnerships in meeting those goals , the congress should consider requiring dod to develop measurable goals for improving future operations of its depot facilities to include ( 1 ) facilities recapitalization , ( 2 ) retention of specific depot capabilities , and ( 3 ) human capital plans for preserving a viable workforce .
dod and contractor officials have identified 14 characteristics that they believe over time will contribute to a partnership's success in achieving dod's objective of improved depot efficiency and viability , but dod has not developed sufficient data and goals for assessing its partnering initiative .
dod also expects these improvements to depot operations to ultimately improve support for war fighters .
however , dod's ability to measure the partnerships' overall success is limited because it has not yet developed baseline data and measurable goals for assessing the outcomes of its partnering efforts and the metrics that it has developed sometimes will not provide the clear data needed to fully assess the partnerships .
dod is limited in its ability to measure the overall success of its partnering efforts because it has not yet developed baseline data and measurable goals for the expected outcomes of the effort .
we also visited 14 of dod's 20 major maintenance depots where these partnerships are ongoing .
however , the department's reluctance to establish overall goals for partnerships makes it unclear as to the overall role that dod envisions for partnerships in its depots â€” even though dod's focus on partnering was intended as one means of fostering improvements in government owned and operated depot facilities .
dod does plan to greatly expand the use of public - private partnerships to help achieve the partnership initiative's objective of improving the efficiency and viability of its military depots .
