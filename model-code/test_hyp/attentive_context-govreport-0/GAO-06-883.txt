the dod science and technology ( s&t ) community is tasked with ensuring that technologies are mature when dod's acquisition community takes over and integrates the technologies into weapon systems .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on the technological superiority of its weapon systems and armed forces to protect u.s. interests at home and abroad .
in fiscal year 2006 , dod plans to spend approximately $13 billion in its science and technology efforts to develop technologies that are as innovative as stealth and global positioning were when they were first developed .
although the united states has produced the best weapons in the world , its acquisition programs often incur cost overruns , schedule delays , and performance shortfalls that undermine dod's buying power .
specifically , our objectives are to ( 1 ) identify techniques that commercial companies use to transition mature technologies before the start of product development and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which dod is using these techniques .
this report examines the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to improve its technology transition processes , with a focus on identifying specific management , funding , and organizational practices that could improve technology transition and weapon system outcomes .
this dilemma is due in part to dod's difficulty transitioning technologies from a technology development environment to an acquisition program .
dod has adopted some of these practices .
dod relies on its s&t community to identify , pursue , and develop new technologies that improve and enhance military operations and ensure technological superiority over adversaries .
development of dod's new weapon systems depends on two distinct phases: technology development and product development .
achieving this balance is made more challenging because of the need to keep pace with or exceed the pace of innovation and to counter technologies developed by potential u.s. adversaries .
this report examines dod's technology transition processes through the prism of best practices .
specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) identify techniques that commercial companies use to transition mature technologies before the start of product development and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which dod is using these techniques .
dod has continued to allow the acquisition community to take over this task before the s&t community considers the technologies ready for transition .
numerous gao reports have addressed the problems of proceeding with immature technologies and have explained what leading commercial companies do to ward off such problems .
boeing also has metrics that assess the technology's impact on orders for new airplanes and on its ability to reduce manufacturing costs .
while dod is very aware of the need for new advanced technology in its weapon systems , it has not always been effective in transitioning mature and relevant technologies to product development .
dod should take steps to improve its transition of technologies to more efficiently deliver capabilities to its warfighters .
also , darpa uses relationship managers to expedite the efficient transition of technologies to products and dod has established other programs that institutionalize some best practices .
in doing its work , the s&t community must strike a balance between meeting the short - term needs of today's warfighters and the long - term needs of future years' warfighters .
