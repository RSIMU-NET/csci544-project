the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) provided for , among other things , the u.s. - mexican border to be opened on december 18 , 1995 , for increased commercial truck traffic within the border states â€” four in the united states ( arizona , california , new mexico , and texas ) and six in mexico .
however , on december 18 , 1995 , the u.s. secretary of transportation announced that mexican trucks would continue to have access only to commercial zones until u.s. safety and security concerns were addressed .
this follow - on report describes ( 1 ) the results of federal and state inspections of mexican trucks entering the united states in 1996 , ( 2 ) actions by the federal government and border states to increase truck safety enforcement at the border , and ( 3 ) the federal enforcement strategy to ensure that trucks from mexico comply with safety standards when entering the united states .
before that date , trucks making the 12,000 daily border crossings were limited to commercial zones ( designated areas several miles deep ) along the border .
this delay of access is still in effect .
nafta also provides for commercial trucks from mexico to travel throughout the united states as of the year 2000 .
in february 1996 , we reported that many trucks from mexico operating in u.s. commercial zones in mid 1995 were not meeting u.s. safety standards and that the four u.s. border states' readiness for enforcement varied significantly .
as the year 2000 approaches , the united states needs to be assured that trucks entering the country from mexico will be safe and operated safely .
we also recommend that the secretary work actively with gsa , as part of gsa's existing planning process , to ensure that truck safety inspection facilities are included , where practicable , when border installations are planned , constructed , or refurbished .
dot has , among other things , ( 1 ) issued minimum safety standards for trucks and commercial drivers , ( 2 ) provided grants to states to develop and implement programs that would lead to the enforcement of these safety standards , and ( 3 ) conducted reviews of about one - third of all domestic interstate trucking companies in order to determine overall compliance with safety regulations .
first , to measure progress by mexican commercial truck carriers in meeting u.s. safety regulations , we recommend that the secretary encourage the border states to develop and implement measurable results - oriented goals for the inspection of commercial trucks entering the united states from mexico and assist them in doing so .
as widespread concerns exist over whether trucks from mexico comply with u.s. safety regulations , we believe that border - specific performance measures are needed .
nafta's timetable calls for all limits on cross - border access ( i.e. , truck travel within the three countries ) to be phased out by january 2000 .
through the motor carrier safety assistance program ( mcsap ) , dot works in partnership with states to enforce federal truck regulations .
from january 1996 ( the first full month of detailed records of inspections ) through december 1996 ( the most recent month for which data were available as of march 1997 ) , federal and state safety inspectors conducted over 25,000 safety inspections of about 3 million mexican trucks crossing into the united states .
