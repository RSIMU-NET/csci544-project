our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) whether agencies have established complete application inventories and ( 2 ) to what extent selected agencies have developed and implemented processes for rationalizing their portfolio of applications .
of the 24 , 17 agreed with the recommendations directed to them ; one ( the department of defense ) disagreed with the recommendations directed to it ; five ( the department of the treasury , the national science foundation , the nuclear regulatory commission , the small business administration , and the and u.s. agency for international development ) stated that they had no comments ; and one ( the department of justice ) agreed with the assessment and conclusion for three of the four practices associated with establishing a complete software application inventory and provided clarifying information on the two other practices .
in fiscal year 2017 , the federal government is expected to spend more than $90 billion on information technology ( it ) , including software applications .
to address the second objective , we selected six agencies â€” the departments of defense ( dod ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , labor ( labor ) , and the interior ( interior ) ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) ; and national science foundation ( nsf ) .
our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) whether agencies have established complete application inventories and ( 2 ) to what extent selected agencies have developed and implemented processes for rationalizing their portfolio of applications .
the department also provided clarifying information regarding its procedures to ensure application inventory accuracy and provided documentation showing that it updates the inventory and implements quality controls to ensure its reliability .
to improve federal agencies' efforts to rationalize their portfolio of applications , we are recommending that: the heads of the departments of agriculture , commerce , education , energy , health and human services , housing and urban development , the interior , labor , state , transportation , the treasury , and veterans affairs ; and heads of the environmental protection agency ; national aeronautics and space administration ; national science foundation ; nuclear regulatory commission ; office of personnel management ; small business administration ; social security administration ; and u.s. agency for international development direct their cios and other responsible officials to improve their inventories by taking steps to fully address the practices we identified as being partially met or not met ; and the secretaries of defense , homeland security , the interior , and labor ; and the director of the national science foundation to direct the cios and other responsible officials to modify existing investment management processes to address applications more completely .
specifically , the secretary of defense should direct the responsible official to modify the department's existing processes to collect and review cost , technical , and business information for the enterprise and business it systems within the enterprise information environment mission area applications which are currently not reviewed as part of the department's process for business systems ; the secretary of homeland security should direct the department's cio to identify one high - cost function it could collect detailed cost , technical , and business information for and modify existing processes to collect and review this information ; the secretary of the interior should direct the department's cio to document and implement a plan for establishing policy that would define a standard analytical technique for rationalizing the investment portfolio ; the secretary of labor should direct the department's cio to consider a segmented approach to further rationalize and identify a function for which it would modify existing processes to collect and review application - specific cost , technical , and business value information ; and the director of the national science foundation should direct the cio to consistently document evaluations for all applications and report cost information for them in the roadmap or other documentation .
