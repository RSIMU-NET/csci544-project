the objectives of this report were to determine ( 1 ) to what extent does the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) have policies and procedures in place to govern the disaster assistance employee ( dae ) program ; ( 2 ) to what extent are fema's human capital controls over the dae workforce consistent with internal control standards ; and ( 3 ) to what extent does fema's dae training incorporate key attributes of effective training and development programs .
since fiscal year 2007 , there have been 376 federal major disaster declarations in which the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) has obligated $33 billion in major disaster assistance payments .
to meet its mission , fema relies heavily upon its cadre of disaster assistance employees ( dae ) , a reserve workforce that interacts with disaster survivors .
the annual number of federal major disaster declarations has grown 44 percent from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 .
fema is tasked with leading the nation in mitigating , responding to , and recovering from major disasters , both natural and manmade .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) did not provide comments on gao's recommendations ; however , in 2008 fema issued its strategic human capital plan , 2008-2012 , intended to address this recommendation .
daes support joint field office ( jfo ) leadership that administers fema's disaster assistance programs , such as individual assistance ( ia ) and public assistance ( pa ) .
moreover , insufficient detail is provided related to fema's plans for three of the recommendations ; thus it is not clear to what extent these plans will fully address the three recommendations .
fema has taken a number of steps to address recommendations made by us and the dhs oig , but key recommendations remain unaddressed as discussed later in this report .
moreover , the dhs office of inspector general ( oig ) reported that , in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in 2005 , fema new hires did not receive adequate training during fema's accelerated orientation process and fema did not have a central training records management system .
further , the dhs oig noted that the shortage of qualified staff for key positions responding to hurricane katrina negatively impacted the effectiveness of fema's response and recovery operations .
fema has taken actions to make policies and procedures readily available to reservists ; however , fema did not provide details about the mechanisms it has established for its regions to monitor dae policies and procedures or daes' implementation of fema's disaster policies .
however , fema has not identified specifics to these broad plans that allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of its planned actions .
develop a systematic process to track training costs .
the actions dhs reported are important first steps ; however , fema's implementation plans do not fully address one of the seven recommendations , as discussed below .
fema's decentralized structure allows for flexibility in responding to disasters ; however , fema does not monitor how the regions implement dae policies , and how daes implement disaster policies and procedures .
dhs concurred with the recommendations and indicated that fema has taken or is taking steps to address them .
