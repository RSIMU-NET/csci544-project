this report ( 1 ) describes the extent to which lpi is used , ( 2 ) discusses stakeholder views on the cost of lpi , and ( 3 ) describes state and federal oversight of lpi .
to help ensure that adequate data collection efforts by state insurance regulators produce sufficient , reliable data to oversee the lpi market , we recommend that naic: work with the state insurance regulators to develop and implement more robust policies and procedures for the collection of annual data from lpi insurers to ensure they are complete and reliable ; and work with the state insurance regulators to complete efforts to obtain more detailed national data from lpi insurers .
we were asked to review the lender - placed insurance ( lpi ) industry and the role of federal and state regulators in monitoring lpi practices .
without more comprehensive and reliable data , state and federal regulators are lacking an important tool to help them fully evaluate the lpi industry and ensure that consumers are adequately protected .
however , naic and state insurance regulators lack comprehensive and reliable data on lpi premium rates and industry practices to assess their effects on consumers .
servicers' use of this type of insurance , known as lender - placed insurance ( lpi ) , peaked during the 2007-2009 financial crisis as an increasing percentage of borrowers fell behind on their mortgage and insurance payments .
this report ( 1 ) describes the extent to which lpi is used , ( 2 ) discusses stakeholder views on the cost of lpi , and ( 3 ) describes state and federal oversight of lpi .
homeowners insurance and flood insurance help protect both borrowers and lenders from the financial losses that can arise when homes are damaged .
some state and federal regulators have taken action to improve oversight of lpi .
naic was created to coordinate insurance regulation across states , and the agency needs quality information to evaluate the lpi industry and the effects of its premium rates and practices on consumers .
as part of its efforts to collect financial data on the insurance industry , naic updated its credit insurance experience exhibit ( ciee ) in 2004 to require insurers to submit data on lpi to naic and state regulators .
although naic is working to obtain the missing data , it is unclear when such data might be available , or that its efforts will be effective without additional action .
without more comprehensive and reliable data and adequate policies and procedures to ensure the usefulness of the data , naic is limited in its ability to coordinate lpi regulation nationwide , and state and federal regulators lack reliable data about the industry .
if a borrower allows coverage to lapse or otherwise become inadequate or loses coverage and does not respond to the servicer's requests to provide proof of sufficient coverage , the mortgage loan documents allow the servicer to protect the mortgage holder's interest in the property by purchasing insurance to cover the collateral on the mortgage loan and charge the borrower for the premium .
further , the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) , among other things , amended the real estate settlement procedures act ( respa ) to establish requirements for mortgage servicers on borrower notification before charging for homeowners lpi , termination of homeowners lpi , and refunding premiums paid by the borrower for homeowners lpi while the borrower maintained borrower - purchased coverage , among other things .
