the health insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) of 1996 ( p.l .
as you know , the increased use of information technology in the health care system and the number of parties with routine access to personally identifiable medical data have raised concerns about the potential misuse of these data and the adequacy of the current system of protections .
one of the principal mechanisms for overseeing research is the institutional review board ( irb ) system .
the food and drug administration ( fda ) has regulations nearly identical for oversight of research conducted for drug or medical device approvals .
as the congress continues to consider legislation , one concern is to provide access to medical records for the purposes of research while also offering privacy protections .
if federal legislation is not enacted by august 1999 , the secretary must promulgate regulations setting privacy standards within 6 months .
at the same time , the availability of these data is important for research that can improve the understanding of diseases and treatments across broad populations .
under the current federal policy for the protection of human subjects — which was adopted in 1991 and is known as the common rule — research conducted by academic medical centers , pharmaceutical companies , and other organizations that are supported or regulated by any of 17 federal agencies is subject to review by local boards .
104-191 ) called for protections for the privacy of medical information .
in light of these considerations , we examined issues related to the use of medical records for research .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the privacy of medical records used for health research , which was released today .
pursuant to hipaa , the secretary of health and human services recommended standards with respect to the privacy of personally identifiable information in september 1997 .
as you know , a number of bills addressing privacy standards were introduced in the 105th and 106th congresses , although none has been enacted .
while some of this research is subject to irb review — either because it is federally supported or regulated research or because the organization voluntarily applies federal rules to all of its research — some of the organizations conduct records - based research that is not reviewed by an irb .
when appropriate , irbs are also supposed to consider whether the research projects under their review will protect the privacy of subjects and inform subjects of the extent to which their data will be kept confidential .
in any case , the process of irb review does not ensure the confidentiality of medical information used in research — primarily because the provisions of the common rule related to confidentiality are limited .
i will also discuss the safeguards health care organizations have in place to protect the confidentiality of health information used in research .
in my remarks today , i will describe to what extent medical information used for research depends on personally identifiable information , research that is and is not subject to current federal oversight requirements , and how irbs ensure the confidentiality of health information used in research .
we relied extensively on information we collected from 7 irbs and 12 organizations that conduct health research , including managed care , pharmacy benefit management , pharmaceutical , biotechnology , and health information organizations and integrated health systems .
