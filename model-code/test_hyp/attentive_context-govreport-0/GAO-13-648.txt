these elements include ( 1 ) proposals to enhance training range capabilities and address any shortfalls , ( 2 ) goals and milestones for tracking progress implementing dod's sustainment plan , and ( 3 ) projected funding requirements for implementing planned actions , among others .
to determine whether the department of defense's ( dod ) 2013 sustainable ranges report met the reporting requirements specified in section 366 ( a ) of the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 , as amended , we reviewed the report and compared it with those requirements .
in this review , we determined ( 1 ) whether dod's 2013 sustainable ranges report met the legislative requirements ; and ( 2 ) whether dod acted on gao recommendations to improve its report submissions , and what opportunities , if any , exist for dod to improve future reporting .
these elements included ( 1 ) proposals to enhance training range capabilities and address any shortfalls in resources , ( 2 ) goals and milestones for tracking planned actions and measuring progress , and ( 3 ) projected funding requirements for implementing planned actions , among others .
these goals are as follows: to mitigate encroachment pressures on training activities from competing operating space ; to mitigate frequency spectrum competition ; to meet military airspace challenges ; to manage increasing military demand for range space ; to address impacts from new energy infrastructure and renewable energy impacts ; to anticipate climate change impacts ; and to sustain excellence in environmental stewardship .
to respond to these challenges and increase the long - term sustainability of its military range resources , dod has launched a number of efforts aimed both at preserving its training ranges and addressing the effects of its training activities on the environment and on local communities through the issuance of policy , establishment of programs , and proactive partnering at the federal , state , and local levels .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on access to military land , airspace , sea space , and frequency spectrum to provide its forces a realistic training environment that will prepare them to face combat or complex missions around the globe .
dod has delineated four funding categories to be used by the services to project their range sustainment efforts: modernization and investment , operations and maintenance , environmental , and encroachment .
to determine whether dod acted on gao recommendations to improve its report submissions and what opportunities , if any , exist for dod to improve future reporting , we identified prior gao recommendations and reviewed the status of dod's actions to implement those recommendations in its reporting submissions on sustainable ranges .
competition for access to live training resources may worsen because of domain shortfalls and growing encroachment challenges .
these recommendations were to: ( 1 ) develop an integrated training range database that identifies available training resources , specific capacities and capabilities , and training constraints caused by limitations on the use of training ranges , which could be continuously updated and shared among the services at all command levels , regardless of service ownership ; and ( 2 ) develop a readiness reporting system to reflect the impact on readiness caused by training constraints due to limitations on the use of training ranges .
