this report discusses the impact that peace operations have on u.s. military forces , force structure limitations that may affect the military's ability to respond to other national security requirements while engaged in peace operations , and options for increasing force flexibility and response capability .
we examined ( 1 ) the impact that peace operations have on u.s. military forces , ( 2 ) force structure limitations that may affect the military's ability to respond to other national security requirements while engaged in peace operations , and ( 3 ) options for increasing force flexibility and response capability .
with the end of the cold war , the number , scope , and size of operations other than war have increased dramatically , and the united states has become an active participant in some of these operations .
u.s. military forces have been participating in peace operations for almost 50 years , with limited numbers of personnel .
the continuing force drawdown has compounded challenges for the u.s. military in responding to extended peace operations .
senior administration officials have testified that multilateral peace operations are an important part of this administration's national security strategy,albeit not the centerpiece of u.s. foreign policy .
these options have their own advantages and disadvantages and will require choices on the use of the nation's resources .
all four services have experienced reductions in personnel and equipment that have forced military planners to reevaluate how the services will respond to peace operations and major regional conflicts ( mrc ) .
armored combat divisions have had limited involvement .
however , as the number , size , and scope of peace operations have increased dramatically in the past several years , the nature and extent of u.s. participation have changed markedly .
while u.s. participation in peace operations has increased , the size of the armed forces has declined over the past 8 years .
this in turn demands that the united states encourage the successful conduct of multilateral peace operations and , when it is in the united states' interests , participate in these operations .
peace operations tend to be sustained rather than short - term operations and sometimes have required extended force commitments from the u.s. military services .
operational and environmental challenges further tax support forces .
these officials have stated that the united states must be willing to act to preserve peace and stability in order to advance and protect u.s. interests in the world .
although no one option addresses all the problems we have identified , a combination of these options could substantially ease the problems .
recently , the united states has used much larger numbers of combat and support forces to respond to events in a number of locations , including somalia , macedonia , bosnia , haiti , rwanda , and iraq .
combat forces also have played a significant role in peace operations .
dod is to review peace operations and report in detail on the force structure required to fight and win two mrcs nearly simultaneously while responding to other ongoing or potential operations .
we did not assess whether the united states should participate in peace operations .
consequently , we are not making recommendations regarding reassessing the impact of participation in peace operations in this report .
