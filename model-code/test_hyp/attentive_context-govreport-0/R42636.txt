the increased interest has been driven at least in part by the federal fiscal situation and in part by the state of the economy since the recession began in 2007 .
in recent years , there has been significant congressional interest in compensation of the federal workforce .
issues related to the compensation of federal employees often center on the pay differential between federal workers and their private sector counterparts .
for years , the annual president's pay agent ( ppa ) study , which is covered in greater detail later in this report , has shown a large wage penalty for federal workers compared to private sector workers in similar occupations .
there have been several attempts in recent years to address the issue of compensation between the federal workforce and the private - sector workforce .
these studies and accompanying reporting on the comparison of compensation of federal workers to private sector workers provide an indication of the disparate findings , which makes it difficult to determine how compensation of federal employees actually compares to that of workers in the private sector .
a spate of recent studies , which use a different analytical approach and data sources , has partially contradicted the findings of the ppa study by concluding that at least some federal workers enjoy a wage premium over comparable private sector workers .
in evaluating claims about federal pay , there appear to be two basic approaches to comparing compensation in the federal and private - sector workforces — the human capital approach and the jobs analysis approach .
" ) , while others are empirical ( e.g. , what is the most appropriate model specification for the underlying data structure ? ) .
any modeling of the relationship between the compensation of federal and private sector workers involves making assumptions , which in turn influence the results .
this report attempts to clarify why the recent studies have arrived at different conclusions and examines limitations of the approaches employed in the different studies .
based on the review of studies considered in this report , it appears there is no single study that addresses the question of compensation comparability using a widely agreed - upon methodology .
the studies reviewed were chosen because they are official government studies ( president's pay agent , congressional budget office ) or have received significant attention in policy debates .
these two approaches are not mutually exclusive but may be difficult to combine given data limitations .
finally , there are data limitations that prevent , or at least seriously curtail , researchers from specifying models as fully as possible .
that is not to say individual studies are not methodologically sound ( some are ) , but rather that the questions asked and the assumptions made are not necessarily the same across studies , which at times arrive at vastly different conclusions .
in addition , the two approaches could even produce opposite results .
for example , there is not a dataset available at this time that allows an analyst to combine detailed characteristics of individual workers and detailed characteristics of jobs performed in the federal and private sectors .
as noted previously , to isolate the effect of sector — federal or private — on compensation , many other factors that influence compensation need to be considered ( i.e. , controlled for ) .
