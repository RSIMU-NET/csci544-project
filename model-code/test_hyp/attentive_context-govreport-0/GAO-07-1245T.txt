in response , congress passed the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of 1976 and the staggers rail act of 1980 .
as you know , over 25 years ago , congress transformed federal regulation of the railroad industry .
my comments today are based on our most recent reports issued in august 2007 and october 2006 , and cover ( 1 ) the changes that have occurred in the railroad industry since the enactment of the staggers rail act , including changes in rail rates since 1985 , ( 2 ) the extent of captivity in the industry and stb's efforts to protect captive shippers , and ( 3 ) stb's actions to address our recent recommendations .
after almost 100 years of economic regulation , the railroad industry was in serious economic trouble in the 1970s , with rising costs , losses , and bankruptcies .
railroad officials express concern that any attempt to increase economic regulation will reduce carriers' ability to earn sufficient revenues and limit future infrastructure investment .
in particular , the 1980 act encouraged greater reliance on competition to set rates and gave railroads increased freedom to price their services according to market conditions , including the freedom to use differential pricing — that is , to recover a greater proportion of their costs from rates charged to shippers with a greater dependency on rail transportation .
policymakers continue to believe that the federal government should provide a viable process to protect shippers against unreasonably high rates , as well as address competition issues , while still balancing the interests of both railroads and shippers .
at the same time , the 1980 act anticipated that some shippers might not have competitive alternatives — commonly referred to as “captive shippers” — and gave the interstate commerce commission ( icc ) , and later the surface transportation board ( stb ) , the authority to establish a process so that shippers could obtain relief from unreasonably high rates .
over the past 10 years , significant consolidation has taken place in the freight railroad industry , while railroads — particularly class i railroads — have seen their productivity and financial health improve .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on the freight railroad industry .
since the passage of the staggers rail act in 1980 , we have issued several reports on the freight railroad industry .
together , these pieces of legislation substantially deregulated the railroad industry .
however , only a rate that produces revenue equal to at least 180 percent of the variable cost of transporting the shipment can be challenged .
it will be important that these analysts have the ability that stb has through its statutory authority to inquire into railroad practices as well as sufficient access to information to determine whether rail rates in selected markets reflect justified and reasonable pricing practices , or an abuse of market power by the railroads .
freight railroads have also cut costs by streamlining their workforces ; right - sizing their rail networks ; and reducing track miles , equipment , and facilities to more closely match demand .
in august 2007 , stb finalized rules that require railroads to report their fuel costs and revenue from fuel surcharges .
