authorized in 2003 , jpdo is housed within the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , whose air traffic organization ( ato ) is responsible for modernizing and operating the nation's current atc system .
 ( 1 ) what is the status of jpdo's efforts to plan for ngats ? .
 ( 2 ) what key challenges does jpdo face in moving forward with its planning efforts ? .
 ( 3 ) what key challenges does faa face in transitioning from the current atc system and in implementing ngats ? .
we appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss the status of efforts by the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) to plan for and coordinate the transformation of the nation's current air traffic control ( atc ) system to the “next generation air transportation system” ( ngats ) — a system intended to safely accommodate an expected tripling of air traffic by 2025 .
according to vision 100 , the legislation that authorized jpdo , the transformation to ngats will be completed by 2025 with the assistance of seven organizations that make up jpdo's senior policy committee: the departments of transportation , commerce , defense , and homeland security ; faa ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) ; and the white house office of science and technology policy .
as jpdo plans the transformation to ngats and coordinates the related efforts of its partner agencies , faa will be responsible for both implementing the transformation and safely operating the current atc system 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
my statement is based on our analysis of documents provided by jpdo and its partner agencies ; the perspectives of agency officials and stakeholders with whom we have spoken ; the results of a panel of experts that we convened ; and our review of relevant literature , including jpdo's december 2004 integrated plan and march 2006 progress report .
first , the successful implementation of ngats will depend on faa's incorporating the improved processes into its organizational structure and culture .
the statement also draws on our prior work on faa's program for modernizing the national airspace system , which we have listed as a high - risk program since 1995 .
second , faa may not have the expertise needed to manage the ngats implementation effort .
faa faces challenges in institutionalizing recent improvements in its management and acquisition processes , as well as in obtaining the expertise and resources needed to implement ngats .
third , faa will need resources to implement ngats , some of which may have to come from savings in operating and maintaining the current atc system .
jpdo also faces the challenge of convincing nonfederal stakeholders that the government is fully committed to ngats because , in the past , the government has discontinued work on new technologies for the national airspace system , including one technology in which a nonfederal stakeholder had already invested .
currently , two leadership positions critical to jpdo's success are vacant: jpdo has not had a permanent director for over 6 months , and since the secretary of transportation resigned , the senior policy committee has been without a permanent chairperson .
