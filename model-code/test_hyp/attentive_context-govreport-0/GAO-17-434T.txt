in addition , we have found numerous challenges facing interior's bureau of indian education ( bie ) and bia and the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) indian health services ( ihs ) in administering education and health care services , which put the health and safety of american indians served by these programs at risk .
in our prior work , we identified concerns associated with bia management of energy resources and categorized them into five broad areas: ( 1 ) oversight of bia activities ; ( 2 ) collaboration and communication ; ( 3 ) bia workforce planning ; ( 4 ) technology ; and ( 5 ) bia's data .
we are adding this high - risk area in response to serious and long - standing problems in federal management of indian energy resources and administration of indian education and health care programs , which are highlighted in several of our prior reports , along with reports and testimony from inspectors general , tribal nations , special commissions , and others .
in particular , we have found that the department of the interior's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) has inefficiently managed indian energy resources and the development process and thereby limited opportunities for tribes and their members to use those resources to create economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities .
this would be consistent with the expressed view of congress as to the federal government's trust responsibilities , and strengthen confidence in the performance and accountability of our federal government .
to conduct our prior work , we reviewed relevant laws , regulations , and policies ; reviewed and analyzed federal data ; and interviewed tribal , federal , and industry officials , among others .
in 2016 , congress found in the indian trust asset reform act that “through treaties , statutes , and historical relations with indian tribes , the united states has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support indian tribes and indians.” as further stated in that act , the fiduciary responsibilities of the united states to indians arise in part from commitments made in treaties and agreements , under which indians surrendered claims to vast tracts of land , and this history of federal - tribal relations and understandings has benefitted the people of the united states and established “enduring and enforceable ederal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.” through improvements to federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members , agencies can improve the efficiency of federal programs under which services are provided to tribes and their members .
bia's management of indian energy resources and oversight of development is to be conducted pursuant to federal law , in a manner that is consistent with the federal government's fiduciary trust responsibility to federally recognized indian tribes and their members .
some tribes and their members hold abundant energy resources and have decided to develop these resources to meet the needs of their community , in part because energy development provides opportunities to improve poor living conditions , decrease high levels of poverty , and fund public services for tribal members .
in addition , i will highlight several key actions that we recommended in those reports that federal agencies can take to help overcome challenges associated with the management of indian energy resources .
