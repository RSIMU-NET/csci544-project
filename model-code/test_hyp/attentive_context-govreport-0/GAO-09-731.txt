for example , cpsc could consider convening groups of consumers or neighborhood safety network members to advise on the design and implementation of campaigns targeted to specific communities , surveying nsn members , establishing metrics to measure nsn's success , and evaluating the effectiveness of information campaigns targeted to the racial and ethnic groups at highest risk of drowning as part of its implementation of the virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act .
the key practices include defining goals and objectives ; analyzing the situation ; identifying stakeholders ; identifying resources ; researching target audiences ; developing consistent , clear messages ; identifying credible messengers ; designing media mix ; and establishing metrics to measure success .
the objectives of this report were to examine ( 1 ) what is known about the relative incidence of preventable injuries and deaths related to drowning , poisoning , and suffocation associated with products intended for children's use among minority children compared with nonminority children , and ( 2 ) what actions the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) has taken through its public information and education initiatives to minimize child injuries and deaths , including those in minority populations , related to products intended for children's use .
the u.s. consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) , an independent federal agency charged with protecting the public from consumer products that pose an unreasonable risk of injury and death , estimated that 29,400 deaths in the united states related to consumer products occurred in 2004 .
to address this mandate , we examined ( 1 ) what is known about the relative incidence of preventable injuries and deaths related to drowning , poisoning , and suffocation associated with products intended for children's use among minority children compared with nonminority children , and ( 2 ) what actions cpsc has taken through its public information and education initiatives to minimize child injuries and deaths , including those in minority populations , related to products intended for children's use .
to improve the effectiveness of consumer information efforts , we recommend that the commission , develop and implement cost - effective ways to enhance and assess the likelihood that cpsc's safety messages are received and implemented by all the intended audiences .
cpsc works to fulfill its broad mission in part by conducting research into the causes and prevention of product - related deaths , illnesses , and injury and assisting consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products .
we interviewed federal officials at cpsc and five department of health and human services ( hhs ) organizations to learn about their related programs and initiatives .
the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) established consumer product safety standards and other safety requirements for children's products .
cpsc has identified certain populations as vulnerable or hard to reach with safety information , including older americans , urban and rural low - income families , new parents , and minority groups .
similarly , reports from the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) have documented racial disparities in injury - related death rates among children .
for example , steps cpsc could consider include improving the neiss racial and ethnic classification system ; working with neiss hospitals to improve collection of data on patient race and ethnicity ; and leveraging related data collection efforts , such as those sponsored by the maternal and child health bureau , the national center for health statistics , or the national institutes of health .
