our data sources included the federal procurement data system — next generation ( fpds - ng ) , federal awards and assistance data system ( faads ) , several systems at the centers for medicare & medicaid services , the department of the treasury's ( treasury ) estimates of the revenue loss of tax expenditures , and the office of management and budget's ( omb ) collection of information on federal credit programs .
increasingly , the federal government relies on networks and partnerships to achieve its goals , and many of these involve nonprofit organizations .
therefore , our objectives in this report are to provide information on ( 1 ) the mechanisms through which federal dollars flow to nonprofit organizations ( which we define as those entities that are federally tax - exempt ) , and how federal involvement varies across them , and ( 2 ) what is known about federal dollars flowing through these mechanisms to nonprofit organizations in fiscal year 2006 ( the most recent year for which we could obtain data from all sources ) .
these organizations are involved in a wide array of missions including healthcare , education , poverty alleviation , and economic development , and their missions can align with or complement the objectives of federal programs .
to identify the direct and indirect mechanisms through which nonprofit organizations receive federal funds , we reviewed academic and professional literature , met with experts on the nonprofit sector , reviewed previous gao reports on federal programs that involve nonprofit organizations , reviewed 19 different programs ( see table 3 ) , and met with agency officials .
these tools dictate how the relationships between federal agencies and nonprofit organizations operate , the roles that these entities and others ( including other levels of government ) play , and the degree of control , oversight , and influence that exists between the federal government and nonprofit organizations .
we judgmentally selected these programs using three criteria: they ( 1 ) utilized a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms , ( 2 ) provided services across a variety of policy areas and sectors , and ( 3 ) represented programs among the higher dollar values of all federal programs that involve nonprofit organizations .
to better understand how funds to nonprofit organizations are tracked and how mechanisms operate , we reviewed 19 federal programs selected to provide information on a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms and services across a variety of policy areas and sectors , and to include some of the more highly funded programs involving nonprofit organizations .
federal and nonprofit entities often partner with one another as they work toward the same or similar goals .
our steps included reviewing previous related gao reports and meeting with program officials .
to examine the extent and structure of the partnering between the federal government and the nonprofit sector , you asked us to focus on the funding relationships between the two sectors .
for each program , we analyzed the roles of nonprofit organizations and how federal involvement with and influence on these organizations varied across funding mechanisms .
the information obtained from this review is not generalizable to all programs involving nonprofit organizations .
we believe that this is the appropriate time — as omb is continuing to develop its approach to implementing ffata's subaward data requirements — to identify approaches that could be effective in improving the reliability of this information .
