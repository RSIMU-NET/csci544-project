the federal death penalty act and related provisions establish the procedure that must be followed before a defendant convicted of a federal capital offense may be executed .
murder , committed under any of more than 50 jurisdictional circumstances , is a federal capital offense .
so are treason , espionage , and certain drug kingpin offenses .
by the time of the revised statutes of 1878 , the list of federal capital offenses included treason ; and murder , arson , or rape in u.s. special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ; piracy ; insurance fraud involving the destruction of a vessel at sea ; and the rescue of an individual under sentence of death .
the death penalty has long been a sentencing option in this country .
the federal death penalty act reflects the constitutional boundaries identified in furman and subsequent related supreme court decisions .
after furman , where the supreme court found unconstitutional imposition of capital punishment pursuant to procedures then required under state and federal law , congress made procedural adjustments to revive the death penalty as a sentencing option first in air piracy cases , then in drug kingpin homicide cases , and finally as a general matter in the federal death penalty act .
when the first congress convened , it made federal capital offenses of murder within federal enclaves , treason , and piracy , as well as forgery and counterfeiting of federal certificates and public securities .
when the supreme court announced its decision in furman v. georgia , the number of federal capital murder offenses had increased , but the inventory of capital offenses that did not include death as an element had been reduced to rape , treason , and espionage .
capital punishment was a feature of english law that the early colonists brought with them .
now federal capital offenses are confined to espionage , treason , certain drug kingpin offenses ( that do not involve murder ) , and murder under various jurisdictional circumstances .
although law among the colonies was hardly uniform beyond its english foundations , murder , rape , grand larceny , and various other property crimes appear to have been among the crimes punishable by death in each of the colonies .
two others felt that the then existing sentencing procedures failed to equitably separate the wheat from the chaff: the system did not ensure imposition of the death penalty , the most severe punishment , uniformly in the most deserving cases and only in the most deserving cases .
and , they argued that the unfair , arbitrary , capricious standard advanced by three members of the majority was a due process standard which the court the year before had found posed no impediment to implementation of state capital sentencing statutes .
in fact , "[a]t the time the eighth amendment was ratified , capital punishment was a common sanction in every state. .
the remaining four justices dissented on three grounds .
some states sought to remedy arbitrary imposition of the death penalty by making capital punishment mandatory .
once here , they often supplemented english law with provisions of their own .
it simply states: "the court holds that the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in these cases constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments. .
