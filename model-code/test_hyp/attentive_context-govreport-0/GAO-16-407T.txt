to address these issues , dhs initiated hrit in 2003 to consolidate , integrate , and modernize the department's information technology ( it ) infrastructure that supports human resources .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement the human resources information technology ( hrit ) investment .
since dhs was created in 2002 and merged 22 agencies into one department with eight components , its human resources environment has included fragmented systems , duplicative and paper - based processes , and little uniformity of data management practices .
specifically , my remarks today summarize key findings from that study , which ( 1 ) evaluated the progress dhs has made in implementing the hrit investment and how effectively dhs managed the investment , ( 2 ) determined whether the performance and learning management system ( palms ) — hrit's only ongoing program — is being implemented enterprise - wide , and ( 3 ) evaluated the extent to which palms is implementing selected it acquisition best practices .
according to dhs , these limitations in its human resources environment are compromising the department's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission .
key causes for dhs's lack of progress in implementing hrit and its associated strategic improvement opportunities include unplanned resource changes and the lack of involvement of the hrit executive steering committee .
however , as of november 2015 , dhs had fully implemented only 1 of the strategic improvement opportunities , which included 2 associated projects .
however , dhs has also made limited progress in achieving these two performance targets .
the information in my testimony is based on our report being released at today's hearing on the results of our review of dhs's implementation of hrit .
without developing and maintaining a current schedule showing when dhs plans to implement the strategic improvement opportunities , dhs and congress will be limited in their ability to oversee and ensure dhs's progress in implementing hrit .
dhs has partially implemented five of the other strategic improvement opportunities , but it is unknown when they will be fully addressed .
additionally , dhs developed an hrit strategic plan for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 that outlined the investment's key goals and objectives , including reducing duplication and improving efficiencies in the department's human resources processes and systems .
according to the human capital segment architecture blueprint , dhs planned to implement 14 of the 15 strategic improvement opportunities and 68 of the 77 associated projects by june 2015 ; and the remaining improvement opportunity and 9 associated projects by december 2016 .
figure 1 provides a summary of hrit's progress towards achieving its service delivery performance targets .
the strategic plan identified , among other things , two performance metrics that were focused on reductions in the number of component - specific human resources it services provided and increases in the number of department - wide hrit services provided by the end of fiscal year 2016 .
implementing our recommendations is critical to the department addressing its fragmented and duplicative human resources environment that is hindering the department's ability to efficiently and effectively perform its mission .
