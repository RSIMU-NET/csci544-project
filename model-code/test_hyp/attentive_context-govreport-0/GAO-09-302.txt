since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the department of defense ( dod ) has been engaged in domestic and overseas military operations in support of the global war on terrorism ( gwot ) around the world .
congress has provided about $808 billion in supplemental and annual appropriations for gwot since 2001 , and dod has reported total gwot costs of about $654.7 billion as of september 2008 .
in order to improve the transparency and reliability of dod's reported obligations for gwot by contingency operation , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) to ( 1 ) ensure dod components establish an auditable and documented methodology for determining what portion of gwot costs is attributable to operation iraqi freedom versus operation enduring freedom when actual costs are not available , and ( 2 ) develop a plan and timetable for evaluating whether expenses not directly attributable to specific gwot contingency operations are incremental costs and should continue to be funded outside of dod's base budget .
for fiscal year 2009 , congress has provided dod with about $65.9 billion for gwot as of march 2009 , and dod plans on requesting an additional $75.5 billion for gwot for the remainder of the fiscal year .
obtaining an accurate picture of dod costs is of critical importance given the need to evaluate trade - offs and make more effective use of defense dollars in light of the nation's long - term fiscal challenge and the current financial crisis .
these operations include operation noble eagle aimed at defending the united states homeland against terrorist attacks ; operation enduring freedom that takes place principally in and around afghanistan , but also covers additional operations in the horn of africa , the philippines , and elsewhere ; and operation iraqi freedom that focuses principally on iraq .
to assist congress in its oversight role , we assessed ( 1 ) dod's progress in improving the accuracy and reliability of its gwot cost reporting , and ( 2 ) dod's methodology for reporting gwot costs by contingency operation , including the types of costs reported for those operations .
congress uses dod's historical cost data to monitor costs , evaluate funding needs , and to make gwot - related funding decisions .
in the past , we have reported on the need for dod to become more disciplined in its approach to developing plans and budgets , including building more gwot costs into the base defense budget .
this is in addition to about $512.7 billion already provided in dod's base budget for other functions .
in addition , dod has acknowledged that systemic weaknesses with its financial management systems and business operations continue to impair its financial information .
dod's efforts are ongoing and we have continued to monitor its progress as gwot cost reporting has evolved .
dod uses these cost data , along with other information , internally to evaluate cost trends and formulate gwot funding requests , and externally to inform congress on the costs of the war .
to assess dod's progress in improving the accuracy and reliability of its gwot cost reporting , we analyzed information reported in dod's monthly supplemental and cost of war execution report ( cost - of - war report ) and cost data in the military services' individual accounting systems .
