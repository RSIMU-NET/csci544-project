we provided a draft of this report for review and comment to gsa , the departments of defense ( dod ) , energy ( doe ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , justice ( doj ) , state , the treasury , and veterans affairs ( va ) ; the administrative office of united states courts ; the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) ; the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) ; the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) ; the social security administration , and agencies which determined that the information about the foreign - owned buildings that they occupy is for official use only and is not included in this report .
the general services administration ( gsa ) leases space for many agencies in the federal government , including some high - security space .
the federal government routinely leases space from private sector landlords , including high - security space occupied by law enforcement agencies and members of the intelligence community .
we recommend that the administrator of the general services administration determine whether the beneficial owner of high - security space that gsa leases is a foreign entity and , if so , share that information with the tenant agencies so they can adequately assess and mitigate any security risks .
we have previously reported that government facilities — some of which contain high - security space used for classified operations , data centers , and to store items such as weapons and sensitive evidence — are vulnerable to threats from foreign sources that may affect their information systems and the physical security of the occupants .
we reviewed: ( 1 ) what is known about foreign ownership of high - security space leased by gsa ; ( 2 ) what potential risks , if any , are posed by foreign ownership of high - security gsa - leased space associated with physical and cybersecurity and sources of funding ; and ( 3 ) what policies and procedures guide gsa's leasing of space from foreign - owned entities and how gsa follows them .
as the leasing agent , gsa is in the best position to identify the beneficial owners of the high - security space that it leases and communicate the relevant information to its federal tenants so that they may adequately assess and mitigate any potential security risks associated with them .
as a result , gsa cannot rely on cfius to identify and mitigate these risks .
because cfius's authority is limited to reviewing foreign acquisitions that could result in control of a u.s. business , which rarely involves gsa - leased space , cfius has a limited role in identifying and mitigating risks of gsa leasing from foreign companies .
however , the extent to which gsa is leasing high - security space from foreign owners — entities based in foreign countries — is unclear .
dhs , doj , the department of the treasury , and the social security administration provided technical comments which we incorporated as appropriate .
gsa provided us with information about the steps that it took to ensure the completeness and reliability of its leasing data .
gsa's incomplete information and lack of policies and procedures regarding foreign ownership of high - security leased space may undermine the security of the tenants' facilities .
