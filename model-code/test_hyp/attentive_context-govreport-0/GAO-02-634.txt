 ( 4 ) what efforts are being made at the national level to address the illegal diversion of prescription drugs ? .
 ( 3 ) what challenges do states face in implementing and using pdmps ? .
fifteen states currently operate prescription drug monitoring programs ( pdmps ) as a means to control the illegal diversion of prescription drugs .
the increasing diversion of prescription drugs for illegal use is a disturbing trend in the nation's battle against drug abuse .
 ( 2 ) what benefits have state pdmps produced ? .
the most frequently diverted prescription drugs are those that are prone to abuse , addiction , and dependence , such as hydrocodone ( the active ingredient in lortab and many other drugs ) , diazepam ( valium ) , methylphenidate ( ritalin ) , and oxycodone ( the active ingredient in oxycontin and many other drugs ) .
according to the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , increases in the extent of prescription drug abuse and in emergency room admissions related to prescription drug abuse , as well as an increase in the theft and illegal resale of prescription drugs , indicate that drug diversion is a growing problem nationwide .
prescription drug diversion is the channeling of licit pharmaceuticals for illegal purposes or abuse .
because of your interest in the issues of prescription drug diversion and control , you asked us to address the following questions: ( 1 ) how do the 15 pdmps compare across states in terms of objectives , design , and operation ? .
they provide data and analysis to state law enforcement and regulatory agencies to assist in identifying and investigating activities potentially related to the illegal prescribing , dispensing , and procuring of prescription drugs .
the abuse of illegally diverted prescription drugs is associated with serious consequences , including addiction , overdose , and death .
moreover , the $2 million in grants available from the bureau of justice assistance , and to be administered jointly with dea , provides states with a potential source of funding to start a pdmp .
prescription drug monitoring programs offer states a more efficient means of detecting and deterring illegal diversion .
cooperative efforts at the state and national levels are seeking to overcome these challenges and increase the number of states with programs .
in 2000 , the most recent year for which data are available , about 9 million americans aged 12 and older reported using prescription drugs , including pain relievers , tranquilizers , stimulants , or sedatives , for nonmedical purposes .
to address the questions concerning the state pdmps , we reviewed information from dea and the national alliance for model state drug laws on the features of the existing programs .
in addition , a number of other states have enacted or are considering legislation to establish a program .
the alliance also facilitates communication between states that are considering a pdmp and states that have programs in place , and provides technical assistance to states on implementing its recommendations .
pdmps collect , review , and analyze prescription data from pharmacies .
it can involve activities such as “doctor shopping” by individuals who visit numerous physicians to obtain multiple prescriptions , illegal sales of prescription drugs by physicians or pharmacists , and prescription forgery .
