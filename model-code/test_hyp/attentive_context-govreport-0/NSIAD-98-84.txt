specifically , we reviewed ( 1 ) the extent , nature , and cost of civil military projects ; ( 2 ) the consistency of dod's guidance on the irt program with statutory requirements ; ( 3 ) the conformity of selected projects to statutory requirements , especially those dealing with military training ; and ( 4 ) the effectiveness of the office of the secretary of defense's ( osd ) and service secretaries' oversight of such projects .

dod conducts these civil military projects under its innovative readiness training ( irt ) program , as authorized by 10 u.s.c .
this report responds to the requirement in section 595 in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 ( p.l .

in fiscal year 1997 , congress appropriated $16 million in such funding for the program .
to assess the nature , extent , and cost of the support and services dod has provided under 10 u.s.c .
these projects consist of three road - building projects ( operation alaskan road on annette island , alaska ; navajo nation building project between sawmill and fort defiance , arizona ; and operation good neighbor near gallup , new mexico ) ; one medical project ( mirt 97 - adams county , ohio ) ; one project to place excess combat vehicles off the shore of new jersey to build artificial reefs ( operation reefex 97 ) , and one project to reconstruct a basketball court ( operation crescent city 97 in louisiana ) .

legislation enacted in 1992 authorized a civil - military cooperative action program under which dod was permitted to use the armed forces' skills and resources to assist civilian efforts to meet domestic needs by participating in projects and activities that would benefit the community.one of the objectives of the program was to enhance individual and unit training and morale in the armed forces through meaningful community involvement .
the law also requires that assistance be incidental to military training , not adversely affect the quality of training , and not result in a significant increase in the cost of the training ; unit's assistance meet valid unit training requirements ; and individual members' assistance be directly related to their specific military specialties .
like the prior statute , the current legislation ( 10 u.s.c .
although the directive meets the legislation's requirements , dod could improve the directive by addressing how it will implement the statutory requirement that the provision of assistance not result in a significant increase in the cost of training .
dod also stated that it has fully accounted for resources specifically authorized and appropriated in fiscal year 1997 to fund irt projects and that the services are responsible for irt related costs funded from service resources .
dod has implemented the irt program through its directive , much of which restates in nearly identical language the statutory provisions governing the program .
