congress established the national wild and scenic rivers system ( nwsrs ) in 1968 through the wild and scenic rivers act ( wsra ) .
the wsra established a policy of preserving designated free - flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations .
it also complemented the then - current national policy of constructing dams and other structures that altered flow along many rivers .
designated rivers usually are referred to as wild and scenic rivers ( wsrs ) .
congress establishes new wsrs within the system , directs the administration to study potential wsrs , and determines the level of agency funding for wsr administration .
for individual wsrs , congress has made specific provisions concerning river management , land acquisition and use in river corridors , and other matters .
ongoing issues for congress include whether to designate additional wsrs , how to address local and federal roles on nonfederal river segments , and more .
the wsra established three classes of wsrs , reflecting the characteristics of a river at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of development that may be allowed afterward: w ild rivers are free from impoundments ( dams , diversions , and so forth ) and generally inaccessible except by trail .
congress plays an ongoing role in shaping the nwsrs through legislation and oversight .
at the passage of the wsra in 1968 , congress initially designated 789 miles in eight rivers as part of the nwsrs and began to expand the system in 1972 ; since then , every congress has added rivers .
altogether , the system now includes 226 river units comprising over 13,400 miles in 41 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico .
recreational rivers are readily accessible by road , with some shoreline development , and may have been subject to some impoundment or diversion in the past .
the act states that the studies are to discuss , among other things , the "outstandingly remarkable values" ( orvs ) that make the area worthy or unworthy of addition to the system ; current land ownership and use ; potential future uses of the land and water that could be affected by addition to the system ; the federal agency that would administer the area ; the cost of acquiring the land , if applicable ; and the extent to which management costs would be shared by state and local agencies .
the potential use of condemnation authority to acquire lands on partnership wsrs has been particularly contentious .
congress and nps have used varying methods to address concerns about local versus federal control of partnership wsrs and about adequate levels of protection for partnership wsrs , either in individual designating legislation or in agency action prior to or after designation .
the watersheds are primitive , and the shorelines are essentially undeveloped .
scenic rivers are free from impoundments and in generally undeveloped areas but are accessible in places by roads .
the secretary of the interior or agriculture , as appropriate , is responsible for conducting authorized studies and reporting to the president on the suitability of a proposed addition .
congress may designate rivers as part of the system without first requiring a study .
