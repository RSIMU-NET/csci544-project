although it is generally agreed that congress has the authority to regulate the federal mail system and interstate wire communications , the sparse text and potential breadth of the honest services statute have prompted concerns regarding its constitutionality .
perhaps in part to address the disagreement among the courts of appeals , the supreme court granted writs of certiorari in three cases , weyhrauch v. united states , black v. united states , and skilling v. united states .
the supreme court in skilling v. united states held that the honest services class of mail and wire fraud offenses proscribes only bribery and kickbacks .
in doing so , the court took the middle ground between those who had urged that the definition be found unconstitutionally vague and those who favored sweeping and severe condemnation of public and private corruption .
congress enacted the honest services statute , 18 u.s.c .
section 1346 , in 1988 to incorporate within the ambit of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes schemes infringing on a victim's right to an official's or employee's "honest services" ( i.e. , an employee's honest work on behalf of a company or an official's honest public service ) .
the federal mail and wire fraud statutes , 18 u.s.c .
over time , the scope of "scheme or artifice to defraud" has been a subject of contentious debate , particularly with regard to schemes to defraud victims of rights unrelated to pecuniary assets .
for the purpose of mail and wire fraud prosecutions , federal jurisdiction is triggered when a person utilizes the federal postal service or an interstate carrier or sends a wire or radio communication .
the cases provided the court's first opportunity to interpret the honest services fraud statute since it was enacted .
however , the federal courts of appeals disagreed regarding the appropriate approach .
in the private sector , a notable case involves the conviction of jeffrey skilling , a former enron executive .
high - profile examples include a guilty plea by the lobbyist jack abramoff to conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and the indictment of former illinois governor rod blagojevich on honest services fraud and related charges .
prompted by these and other considerations , federal courts have employed judicial interpretation techniques to avoid an overly broad reading of the statute .
likewise , in an opinion dissenting from the supreme court's decision to deny review in a 2008 honest services case , justice scalia suggested that the statute's vague language invites federal prosecution of seemingly commonplace actions , such as "a mayor's attempt to use the prestige of his office to obtain a restaurant table without a reservation. .
the court's granting of the three writs within a relatively short time frame , less than a year after justice scalia's strongly worded dissent from the denial of certiorari in a case from the court's 2008 term , prompted speculation that the supreme court might construe the statute narrowly .
particularly with the decision to review skilling , a highly publicized case connected with the collapse of enron , the grants of certiorari garnered significant media attention .
critics of the statute have argued that its mere "28 words" form a vague and unfair basis for federal criminal jurisdiction in many cases .
