to examine the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) spending and workload for mental health services , we examined , for fiscal year 2009 , ( 1 ) va's spending for mental health services and ( 2 ) va's workload for mental health services .
in this report , we examined , for fiscal year 2009 , ( 1 ) va's spending for mental health services and ( 2 ) va's workload for mental health services .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the nation .
va provides , or pays for , a range of mental health services throughout its 21 health care networks for veterans with conditions such as depression , post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , and substance use disorders .
complete and accurate mental health spending and workload information can help congress effectively oversee va's mental health services and identify va's intended use of resources and workload .
complete and accurate information on va's mental health spending and workload is also important for congressional oversight of va's mental health services .
va's reporting of mental health spending and workload does not give congress a complete overview of va's mental health services and limits information available for congressional oversight .
to enhance information available for congressional oversight and use by stakeholders on va's spending and workload for mental health services , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs take the following four actions: include workload information , including number of encounters and average daily census , by type of service , for mental health services provided in va settings primarily used for providing mental health services with its presentation of mental health spending in its annual congressional budget justification ; include spending and workload information , including number of encounters and average daily census , for mental health services that va pays non - va providers to deliver in community settings in its annual congressional budget justification , or in a separate , annual , publicly available report soon after the information becomes available ; include spending and workload information , including number of encounters and average daily census , for mental health services provided in va settings not primarily used for providing mental health services in its annual congressional budget justification , or in a separate , annual , publicly available report soon after the information becomes available ; and include workload information , including number of visits , for counseling services to address mental health issues provided by vet centers in its annual congressional budget justification , or in a separate , annual , publicly available report soon after the information becomes available .
this information is used to conduct congressional oversight functions , for example determining the adequacy of va funding and assessing va's current efforts to address the mental health care of veterans .
to effectively manage its resources and achieve its goal , va needs com plete and accurate information on the amount it spends each fiscal year to provide mental health services and on its mental health workload , which is the amount of mental health care va provides .
we also recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for health to identify ways of incorporating spending information for vet center counseling services that address mental health issues in va's annual congressional budget justification or in a separate , annual , publicly available report soon after the information becomes available .
