the section 8 housing choice voucher program has come under increasing criticism from the administration and congress for its cost and its complexity .
noting these concerns , the administration has argued in each of the past several years that the existing section 8 voucher program should be dismantled and replaced with a new , broader - purpose grant program .

pha groups opposed the proposal to transfer administration to states and also voiced concerns about erosion in funding levels .
specifically , the bill proposed to modify the current definition of income to exclude imputed income from assets ; eliminate or replace many of the deductions and allowances from income ; provide phas with several methods for calculating income ; change the targeting threshold to the greater of 30% of ami or the poverty level ; eliminate the gross income calculation for rent ; modify income reexamination requirements ; and modify the process and timing for conducting housing inspections .
