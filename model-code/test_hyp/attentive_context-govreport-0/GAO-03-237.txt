people are at the heart of an organization's ability to perform its mission , yet a key challenge for many federal agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , is to strategically manage their human capital .
along with congress and the administration , we have been focusing increased attention on the need for improved human capital management across the government .
the two critical success factors to strategic human capital planning that we identified in our model are ( 1 ) integration and alignment of human capital approaches and ( 2 ) human capital decisionmaking that is data - driven .
since 1997 , a number of dod studies have recommended that dod adopt a strategic approach to managing its human capital .
we also reviewed dod's plans for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans .
in march 2002 , we published a model to assist federal agencies in their human capital management .
for this report , our specific objectives were to review the extent that these two plans , in addressing active duty military benefits , promote ( 1 ) the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and ( 2 ) the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions â€” the two critical success factors identified in our model .
for instance , we testified in march 2001 that dod must step up its efforts to identify current and future workforce needs , assess where it is relative to those needs , and develop strategies for addressing any related gaps .
we too have encouraged dod to improve its human capital management by taking a more strategic approach .
more recently , in our work on benefits for active duty military personnel , we noted that dod lacked a human capital strategy that would align all elements of dod's human capital management , including pay and benefits , with its broader organizational objectives .
these human capital approaches may include policies and practices for recruitment , compensation ( which includes pay as well as benefits ) , promotion , career development , and retention .
under our model , one of the four cornerstones of strategic human capital management is strategic human capital planning .
the other plan addresses quality of life issues affecting service members and their families .
as a follow - on to our work on active duty military benefits , we reviewed two human capital strategic plans that dod published in april 2002 .
according to dod officials , the plans are intended to complement one another and , together with a third human capital plan addressing civilian personnel , constitute dod's overall human capital strategy .
one of these plans addresses military personnel priorities .
we have undertaken a separate review of dod's civilian human capital strategic management .
benefits are one of the important human capital tools an agency has at its disposal for shaping its workforce and meeting organizational goals .
as such , they may provide a useful lens for examining the current state of dod's strategic human capital planning as represented by the two human capital plans we reviewed .
first , the plans do not specifically address how dod will integrate and align benefits and other human capital approaches to meet its overall organizational goals .
