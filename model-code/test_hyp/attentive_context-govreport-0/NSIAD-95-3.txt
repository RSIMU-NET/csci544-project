originally , the department of defense ( dod ) estimated that it would realize $4.1 billion in property sales revenue from military bases closed under the 1988 and 1991 base realignment and closure rounds .
in 1994 , dod reduced this estimate to $1.2 billion .
revenue from property sales is to be used to help pay for the base closure costs .
as agreed with your office , we identified the revenue the government has received and is expecting to receive from these property sales , additional resources the federal government has given to communities to support their plans to reuse the bases , and several issues that delay communities' reuse plans .
about $19 million of the $92 million in sales and pending sales was merely a transfer of funds from one federal agency to another â€” not a revenue gain for the federal government .
the air force has about $16.9 million in pending sales .
communities are asking the federal government to provide ( 1 ) cash grants ; ( 2 ) marketable revenue - producing properties , such as golf courses and housing units , to help pay for reuse activities ; and ( 3 ) funds for upgrading buildings and infrastructure .
the army is credited for almost all of the $69.4 million in property sales revenue and for $5.3 million of the $22.2 million in pending sales .
current plans call for the sale of only about 5 percent of the land .
disagreements between various agencies and jurisdictions have stalled reuse decisions at some bases .
the remaining 7 percent remains in an undetermined status .
we compared the 6-year land revenue estimates from dod's base realignment and closure fiscal years 1991-95 budget justifications for brac - i ( the bases closed in 1988 ) and its fiscal years 1993-95 justifications for brac - ii ( the bases closed in 1991 ) .
federal government real estate that is no longer needed is not automatically sold .
rather , the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 ( the property act ) requires a screening process in which the appropriate government officials explore transferring the property with or without payment to another government or nonprofit agency .
dod responsibility for environmental cleanup further delays disposal of base property .
in a related assignment , we will report on the difficulties in cleaning up bases , the effect of environmental contamination on dod's ability to transfer property , the federal government's liabilities from environmental contamination , and dod's long - term plans for addressing environmental problems at closing bases .
for example , dod first screens excess property for possible use by other dod organizations and then by other federal agencies .
dod has the discretion to determine what the highest and best use for the property is and relies heavily on local reuse plans to make this determination .
the federal government's retention of the contaminated land could significantly reduce cleanup costs since the land will remain undeveloped .
planned sales of 9,400 acres of property will result in additional revenue once final property disposition decisions are made and cleanup or remediation is in place .
if no federal agency has a need for the excess property , it is declared surplus to the federal government and generally is made available to private nonprofit and state and local agencies .
