on december 17 , 2003 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued proposed rules toaddress the effects of interstate transport of air pollutants on non - attainment of the national ambientair quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulates ( pm 2.5 ) and ozone ( specifically , the 8-hourstandard ) .
 ( 1 ) the proposed interstate air quality ( iaq ) rule appeared in the federal register january30 , 2004 .
for pm 2.5 , the proposed rule finds that the interstate transport of sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) andnitrogen oxides ( nox ) from 28 states and the district of columbia contributes significantly todownwind non - attainment ; for ozone , the proposed rule finds that interstate transport of nox from25 states and the district of columbia contributes significantly to downwind non - attainment of the8-hour standard .
states are to implement controls by may 31 , 2004 .
epa estimates of regional nox and so2 caps and percentage reduction ( million tons ) source: proposed interstate air quality rule ( 69 federal register 4566-4650 ) based on the cost - effectiveness methodology , each of the affected states is assigned a statewide "emissions budget. .
with the iaq rule , epa proposes a region - wide emissions cap for nox and so 2 to be implemented in two phases - - 2010 and 2015 .
 ( 2 ) inthe nox sip call , epa found 21 states and the district of columbia significantly contributed to non - attainment of the 1-hour ozone naaqs .
however , epa strongly believes that the regional emissions cap can be most cost - effectivelyachieved through a regional cap - and - trade program focused on electric generators and intends onissuing a proposed cap - and - trade model program rule to encourage that option .
 ( 3 ) to remedy thesituation , epa set statewide emissionsbudgets for nox emissions , and recommended that states achieve those budgets through "highlycost - effective" controls on electric generators and large industrial facilities under a regional cap andtrade program .
to remedy the situation , the proposed rule generally follows the methodology epa employed in an earlier regulation that addressed interstate transport of ozone pollution , the nox sip call .
each covered state would be required to submit a revised state implementationplan ( sip ) identifying measures it intended to implement to achieve its emissions budget .
 ( 39 ) other potential categories of benefits are notassessed .
the difference between the costsand benefits of the proposed rule is an order of magnitude in favor of the benefits .
however , ifpromulgated , the proposed rule would have far - reaching effects in terms ofeconomics , environmental impact , and policy .
based on the methodology employed in the proposedrule , epa's estimates of emissions under the caps are provided in table 1 , along with percentreductions from the basecase .
this number is based primarily on one benefit - - reduced premature fatalities amongadults resulting from reduced pm 2.5 .
with much of the public focus on the accompanying proposed mercury rule , theinterstate air quality rule has not received much attention .
 ( 41 ) the twoproposed rules are integrated in such a way that the technologies reducing so 2 andnox emissions under the interstate air quality rule also reduce enough hg emissionsto meet the 2010 reduction requirements of the proposed mercury rule .
