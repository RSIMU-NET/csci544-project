the commerce , consumer , and monetary affairs subcommittee asked us on november 9 , 1993 , to determine ( 1 ) the adequacy of commerce's administration of its employees' acceptance and reporting of travel funds from nonfederal sources and ( 2 ) the implications , if any , of commerce's denying the office of government ethics ( oge ) access to its records of reimbursed travel in 1992 .
this report presents the results of our review of the programs administered by the department of commerce and federal trade commission ( ftc ) for controlling the acceptance and reporting of travel expenses incurred by their employees and paid by nonfederal organizations .
under regulations promulgated by the general services administration ( gsa ) , federal employees can accept payment of travel costs by nonfederal sources , such as private companies and universities , if the purpose of the travel is related to the employees' official duties and responsibilities and the acceptance of such travel does not present the appearance of a conflict of interest .
on june 6 , 1994 , the subcommittee also asked that we include ftc in our review .
federal agencies are required to establish procedures to ensure that these conditions are met before travel reimbursements are accepted .
collectively , the international trade administration ( ita ) , national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , and national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) accounted for about 79 percent of commerce's trips .
commerce and ftc have established regulations that require adherence to gsa's regulations .
the overall effect of commerce's temporary denial of access was minimal in that oge eventually received access to commerce records , and oge has not been denied access to such records at any other agency .
in the request for comments on the implementing regulations , gsa stated that it expected oge to review agency implementation of section 302 in connection with its ongoing reviews of agency ethics programs .
an official in commerce's office of general counsel said that many of the deficiencies were due to the december 9 , 1992 , change in gsa's regulations , which is discussed on pages 2 and 3 of this report .
ftc also had internal controls in place , including the use of letters of commitment to monitor expenses .
section 302 of the ethics reform act of 1989 ( 31 u.s.c .
these regulations , which have been in effect from march 8 , 1991 , through the present , include a definition of what constitutes conditions for accepting travel reimbursements , a description of payment methods , and a requirement that all instances of nonfederally reimbursed travel in excess of $250 be reported semiannually to oge .
specific responsibilities include developing and reviewing statutes and regulations pertaining to conflicts of interest and monitoring agency ethics programs .
we recommend that the secretary of commerce take actions to ensure that all commerce employees' travel requests containing all of the necessary information , such as the name of the payer and the amount and type of expenses to be paid , are reviewed and approved before a trip ; the office of general counsel , as part of its responsibilities for submitting semiannual reports to oge , ensure that these reports include the required information , including the dates and nature of events attended and expenses paid ; and commerce offices require ( 1 ) travel vouchers and ( 2 ) receipts for reimbursed expenses , except for meals since they are not required by federal travel regulations to be supported in this manner .
