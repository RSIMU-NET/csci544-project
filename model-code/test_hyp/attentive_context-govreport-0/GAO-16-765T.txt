the u.s. commercial space launch industry , which the federal aviation administration ( faa ) reports had estimated revenues of $617 million in 2015 , has experienced considerable change since the enactment of the commercial space launch amendments act of 2004 ( “the act” ) .
in addition , in recent years , faa has been licensing an increasing number of commercial space launches , including those for the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) commercial cargo program , which contracts with commercial launch companies to transport cargo to the international space station ( iss ) .
my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) developments in the commercial space launch industry and ( 2 ) challenges faa faces in overseeing and promoting the industry .
the act promoted the development of the emerging commercial human spaceflight industry and made the department of transportation ( dot ) responsible for overseeing the safety of the new industry — a responsibility that dot delegated to faa .
as part of its safety oversight responsibilities , faa licenses and permits launches as well as licenses launch sites .
the challenges for faa that they identified included: ( 1 ) determining whether and when to regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants and ( 2 ) handling an increased workload relating to licensing and permitting launches and launch sites .
in the 2017 budget submission , faa provided workload indices based on the number of authorizations which the agency uses to authorize companies to conduct one or more launches , the number of licenses and permits , the number of on - site inspections as part of licensing launch sites , and staffing levels since fiscal year 2006 .
for the 2015 report , we reviewed faa's guidance on its launch permit , licensing , and safety oversight activities ; interviewed faa officials , industry stakeholders , and experts who were selected on the basis of their knowledge of faa's oversight of the commercial space launch industry ; and visited spaceports where two 2014 launch mishaps occurred .
to allow the space tourism industry to develop , the act prohibited faa from regulating the safety of crew and “spaceflight participants” before 2012 , except in limited circumstances — a moratorium that was extended to october 1 , 2023 in the commercial space launch competitiveness act enacted in november 2015 .
these challenges included faa's ability to determine the specific circumstances under which it would regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants and estimating its future resource needs to license and permit launch activities .
we will continue to monitor faa's progress toward implementing this recommendation .
to provide congress with more information about the resources requested to address developments in the commercial space launch industry , we recommended that faa provide more detailed information in its budget submissions about its workload .
congress mandated that faa review the methodology and report back to the congress by may 2016 .
faa agreed with the recommendation , but dot also had some concerns about how issues were presented .
in 2006 , we reported that faa had provided a reasonable level of safety oversight regarding commercial launches , but that the agency faced several challenges in regulating the space tourism industry .
