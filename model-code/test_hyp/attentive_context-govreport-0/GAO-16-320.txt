as with our prior reports , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with the requirements for registrations and reports filed under the lda ; ( 2 ) identify any challenges and potential improvements to compliance by lobbyists , lobbying firms , and registrants ; and ( 3 ) describe the resources and authorities available to the u.s. attorney's office for the district of columbia ( usao ) in its role in enforcing lda compliance and the efforts it has made to improve that enforcement .
hlgoa also increased civil penalties and added criminal penalties for failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements .
in addition , hloga requires us to annually audit the extent of lobbyists' compliance with the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended ( lda ) by reviewing publicly available lobbying registrations and other matters .
the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 ( hloga ) amended the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 to require lobbyists to file quarterly lobbying disclosure reports and semiannual reports on certain political contributions .
our objectives were to determine the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended ( lda ) by providing documentation to support information contained on registrations and reports filed under the lda ; to identify challenges and potential improvements to compliance , if any ; and to describe the resources and authorities available to the u.s. attorney's office for the district of columbia ( usao ) , its role in enforcing lda compliance , and the efforts it has made to improve lda enforcement .
this methodology allows us to generalize some elements to the population of ld - 2 reports .
to determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance , we examined a stratified random sample of 80 quarterly lobbying disclosure ( ld - 2 ) reports with income and expenses of $5,000 or more filed during the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2014 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2015 .
usao reports that it is currently collecting payments on two cases which will be closed soon and has three cases which should result in further action in the next 6 months .
the last revision occurred on february 15 , 2013 , to ( among other issues ) update the reporting thresholds for inflation .
this methodology allows us to generalize to the population of ld - 203 reports both with and without contributions .
table 4 shows the status of ld - 203 ( r ) referrals received and the number of enforcement actions taken by usao in its effort to bring lobbying firms into compliance .
about 47 percent ( 783 of 1,672 ) of the referrals are pending further action .
in 2015 , 10 ld - 203 reports were amended in response to our review .
our sample of ld - 2 reports was not designed to detect differences over time .
this is our ninth report under this mandate .
for selected elements of lobbyists' ld - 2 reports that can be generalized to the population of lobbying reports our findings have been consistent from year to year .
