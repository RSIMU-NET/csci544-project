in accordance with united states law , the u.s. government places conditions on the use of defense articles and defense services transferred by it to foreign recipients .
violation of these conditions can lead to the suspension of deliveries or termination of the contracts for such defense items , among other things .
the arms export control act ( aeca ) , as amended , authorizes the transfer by sale or lease of united states origin defense articles and services through the government - to - government foreign military sales ( fms ) program or through the licensed commercial sales process .
on occasion , the president has indicated that such violations by foreign countries "may" have occurred , raising the prospect that termination of deliveries to or imposition of other penalties on such nations might take place .
however , since the major revision of u.s. arms export law in 1976 , neither the president nor the congress have actually determined that a "substantial violation" did occur thus necessitating the termination of deliveries or sales or other penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act .
this report reviews the pertinent sections of u.s. law governing permissible uses of u.s. - origin defense equipment and services by foreign nations , presidential and congressional options for dealing with such violations , and illustrative actions previously taken by the united states in response to possible violations .
section 3 ( c ) of the arms export control act further sets out the circumstances under which a nation may lose ( a ) its u.s. foreign military financing , ( b ) its loan guarantees for purchases of u.s. defense articles and services , ( c ) its rights to have previously purchased u.s. defense articles or services delivered , ( d ) its rights to have previously made agreements for the sale of u.s. defense articles or services carried out .
section 3 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the aeca specifically provides that to be eligible to purchase defense articles and services from the united states: ...[a] country or international organization shall have agreed not ... to use or permit the use of [a defense] article or related training or other defense service for purposes other than those for which furnished , unless the consent of the president has first been obtained... .
section 3 ( a ) of the arms export control act sets the general standards for countries or international organizations to be eligible to receive united states defense articles and defense services provided under this act .
section 3 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( a ) of the arms export control act stipulates , in part , that: no credits ( including participations in credits ) may be issued and no guarantees may be extended for any foreign country under this act as hereinafter provided , if such country uses defense articles or defense services furnished under this act , or any predecessor act , in substantial violation ( either in terms of the quantities or in terms of the gravity of the consequences regardless of the quantities involved ) of any agreement entered into pursuant to any such act ... by using such articles or services for a purpose not authorized under section 4 or , if such agreement provides that such articles and services may only be used for purposes more limited than those authorized under section 4 for a purpose not authorized under such agreement... .
