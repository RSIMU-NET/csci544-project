we are making 14 recommendations to energy to ( 1 ) improve controls over the review and approval process for contractor invoices ; ( 2 ) strengthen accountability for government - owned equipment purchased by contractors ; ( 3 ) improve reporting and control of overall contract costs , including subcontractor costs ; and ( 4 ) pursue opportunities for recovery of improper and questionable costs identified in this report .
the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act of 2000 ( eeoicpa ) was passed by congress , in part , to provide for timely compensation of former nuclear weapons workers who sustained illnesses that could be linked to exposure to toxic substances while employed at a department of energy ( energy ) facility .
concerned with the relatively small number of finalized cases and the overall effectiveness of the program , the senate energy and natural resources committee held three hearings from november 2003 through march 2004 that highlighted programmatic challenges to achieving the program's objectives and energy's limited progress in overcoming them .
specifically , we determined whether ( 1 ) internal controls over program payments were adequately designed to provide reasonable assurance that improper payments to contractors would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business and ( 2 ) program payments were properly supported as a valid use of government funds .
subtitle d of eeoicpa instructed energy to assist its contractors' employees by developing and submitting state workers' compensation claim applications to an independent physician panel for review of each claimant's potential eligibility for workers' compensation benefits .
we also reviewed controls designed to monitor overall contractor costs .
we reviewed the design of controls over program payments , including payments made to contractors .
subtitle d of eeoicpa did not instruct energy to pay the benefits due an eligible worker , but instead authorized energy to assist the claimant in filing a claim to receive compensation from a state workers' compensation program .
for example , we reported that a shortage of qualified physicians serving on the review panels continued to constrain energy's capacity to decide cases more quickly .
we primarily focused on payments to key contractors that received approximately 60 percent of the $92 million in program expenditures through september 2005 .
further , in may 2004 , we issued a report identifying issues with the claims review process .
prior to the amendment of eeoicpa , in a letter dated august 30 , 2004 , you asked us to review costs incurred by energy in its administration of subtitle d by considering the design of internal controls over expenditures and the propriety of program payments .
in october 2004 , eeoicpa was amended to repeal subtitle d and add a new subtitle e to be administered by the secretary of labor .
we used a variety of forensic auditing techniques , including data mining , to identify payments for detailed review .
to address these objectives , we considered payments made by the office of worker advocacy ( owa ) , the energy office tasked with administering subtitle d , from the inception of the program in october 2000 through september 30 , 2005 .
energy also said it would revise its current policies or procedures as appropriate and described corrective actions it had already undertaken to improve its controls , including those over interagency contracting .
