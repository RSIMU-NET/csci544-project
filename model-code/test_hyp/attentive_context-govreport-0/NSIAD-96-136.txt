uoes is intended to ( 1 ) allow military users to influence the thaad system design , ( 2 ) permit an early operational assessment of the system's capabilities , and ( 3 ) provide a system that could be deployed in a national emergency .
the ballistic missile defense organization and the army plan to acquire a theater high altitude area defense ( thaad ) user operational evaluation system ( uoes ) — an early prototype version of the final thaad system .
we are addressing this report to the committees of jurisdiction because it identifies problems and calls for corrective action that the department of defense ( dod ) has indicated an unwillingness to take .
the congress may also wish to restrict obligational authority for acquiring uoes until the secretary of defense certifies that the system has adequate operational effectiveness to merit its deployment in a national emergency .
uoes will consist primarily of refurbished components acquired for the system's demonstration and validation phase , although the army plans to purchase 40 uoes interceptors to provide the deployable system capability .
this report does not address the overall value of the thaad system .
pursuant to our basic legislative responsibilities , we reviewed the thaad uoes program to determine whether planned testing would reasonably demonstrate the capabilities of uoes as an interim system before funds are committed to interceptor production .
we are suggesting that the congress may wish to take the necessary action to ensure that dod addresses the problems we have identified .
because dod has clearly indicated its intention to commit over $200 million for uoes interceptors that may have inadequate operational effectiveness and because the current schedule will provide only 14 of the 40 interceptors by fiscal year 1998 , the congress may wish to consider delaying the timetable for acquiring thaad uoes set forth in the 1996 defense authorization act .
in commenting on a draft of this report , dod disagreed with our recommendations , stating that thaad uoes will serve three functions in priority order: ( 1 ) providing soldiers an opportunity to influence the system's design ; ( 2 ) conducting early operational assessments of the system ; and ( 3 ) if directed by the national command authority , providing a theater commander in chief with a limited missile defense capability .
accordingly , to avoid committing over $200 million for a system that may not have adequate operational effectiveness , we recommend that the secretary of defense ( 1 ) restrict obligational authority for uoes interceptors until the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff certifies that uoes has adequate effectiveness to merit deployment as an interim system and ( 2 ) seek legislative relief from the requirements of the 1996 national defense authorization act in regards to acquiring thaad uoes by fiscal year 1998 .
we performed our work at the office of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , office of the secretary of defense , headquarters of the ballistic missile defense organization ; the department of the army in washington , d.c. ; and the thaad project office in huntsville , alabama .
the 16-month delay in delivery results from ( 1 ) extended lead times — from 18 to 29 months — in delivery of some interceptor components and ( 2 ) reduced fiscal year 1997 funding that further extended final deliveries from 29 to 34 months .
