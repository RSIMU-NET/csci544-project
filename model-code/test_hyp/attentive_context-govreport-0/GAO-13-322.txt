over the longer term , such a strategy should include an analysis of medical services spending based on reliable and detailed agency - wide data , and should enable dod to identify opportunities to consolidate requirements and reduce costs .
this report ( 1 ) describes the contracting practices used by the military departments to provide health care professional services and what is known about the cost effectiveness of these practices , ( 2 ) assesses the extent to which the military departments have consolidated their health care staffing requirements , ( 3 ) identifies the percentage of contract health care professionals at on - base and off - base facilities and discusses the extent to which the costs associated with care provided by these professionals can be compared , ( 4 ) describes the training requirements and experience of medical services contracting personnel , and ( 5 ) identifies the extent to which the military departments have policies or procedures that address legislated quality standards for contract health care professionals and for the staffing companies that provide them .
the department of defense ( dod ) operates a large and complex health care system that employs more than 150,000 military , civilian , and contract personnel working in military hospitals and clinics , commonly referred to as military treatment facilities ( mtf ) .
in addition , dod must balance the challenges posed by maintaining a health care system that meets the military's readiness needs while also making changes in its business and health care practices to control costs and improve effectiveness .
the strategy should identify specific responsible organizations and timeframes , and should consist of both near - term and long - term components: in the near term , and to enable dod to assess the efficacy and impact of such a strategy , dod should identify a category of health care professionals or a multi - service market to pilot an approach to consolidating health care staffing requirements .
dod's fiscal year 2014 budget request for health care is almost $50 billion , and is projected to increase substantially in the next few years .
historical rates of cost growth in dod's military health system have been significantly higher than the corresponding rates in the national economy .
section 726 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 ( ndaa for fy 2012 ) directed us to review the contracting activities of the military departments with respect to providing health care professional services to members of the armed forces , dependents , and retirees .
to achieve additional cost savings and efficiencies through increased use of strategic sourcing , we are recommending that the secretary of defense develop and implement a dod - wide strategy to contract for health care professionals .
dod stated that a shared services contracting subworking group will include this report and its recommendations in their comprehensive review of contracting strategies , governance , and processes .
to address all objectives , we interviewed and obtained documentation , including contract data , from officials at 11 mtfs and the following organizations: army health care acquisition activity , navy medical logistics command , air force medical service , joint task force national capital region medical command ( jtf capmed ) , and dod's tricare management activity ( tma ) .
