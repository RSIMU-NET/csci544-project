direct the secretary of the navy to update its cost estimates and in doing so: include in its sensitivity analysis an assessment of the range of possible costs for extending the service life of other nonstructural components that are becoming obsolete and capability upgrades that may be required for some of the 150 aircraft , and obtain an independent review of the updated cost estimates .
considering that further slips in the f - 35 program may occur and could increase the scope and cost of the services' plans for upgrading and extending the service life of current aircraft , you asked us to ( 1 ) describe the air force and navy plans to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft , and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which cost estimates for these programs exhibit characteristics of a high - quality cost estimate .
to improve future updates of air force and navy cost estimates for upgrading and extending the service life of selected f - 16s and f / a - 18s and to improve the ability of decision - makers to assess the potential total costs , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following four actions: direct the secretary of the air force to update its cost estimates , and in doing so: include in its sensitivity analysis an assessment of the range of possible costs if the capability - upgrade and service - life extension programs are expanded to more than 300 aircraft including up to the maximum of 650 aircraft , and obtain an independent review of the updated cost estimates .
overall , the air force and navy have about 3,500 fighter aircraft in inventory as of fiscal year 2012 , including about 1,020 air force f - 16s many of the department of defense's and about 624 navy f / a - 18 a - ds .
 ( dod ) current fighter aircraft are more than 20 years old on average , and although dod plans to replace much of the existing inventory by procuring 2,443 new f - 35s , the department has experienced numerous delays and cost increases in the f - 35 program .
without fully credible cost estimates , service and congressional decision - makers will not have reasonable confidence of knowing the potential range of costs to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft as they make resource and trade - off decisions , develop and review budget requests , and assess the programs' affordability .
these programs are estimated to cost several billion dollars at a time when dod is simultaneously facing the competing demands of developing and procuring f - 35s at a cost approaching $400 billion , supporting ongoing operations , and implementing $487 billion of reductions over the next 10 years , which the department has estimated that it needs to cut in order to comply with the budget control act of 2011 .
these aircraft operate during the first days of a conflict to penetrate enemy air space and defeat air defenses , which allows follow - on forces freedom to operate .
