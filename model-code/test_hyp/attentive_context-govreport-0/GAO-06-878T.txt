we identified weaknesses in four key areas: ( 1 ) field inspections , ( 2 ) data mining processes that exclude many large farming operations when farmers do not report their interest in them , ( 3 ) quality assurance reviews conducted by insurance companies , and ( 4 ) imposition of sanctions .
my testimony today focuses on two primary issues discussed in the september 2005 report: ( 1 ) the effectiveness of usda's procedures and processes to prevent and detect fraud , waste , and abuse in selling and servicing crop insurance policies , and ( 2 ) the extent to which program design issues may make the program more vulnerable to fraud , waste , and abuse .
in part , to improve the integrity of the crop insurance program , congress enacted the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 ( known as arpa ) .
in 2005 , the crop insurance program provided $44 billion in insurance coverage for over 200 million acres of farmland at a cost of $2.7 billion to the federal government , including $117 million estimated by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) risk management agency ( rma ) to have resulted from fraud , waste , and abuse .
as you know , federal crop insurance is part of the overall safety net of programs for american farmers .
however , concerns have arisen that some farmers may have abused the crop insurance program by allowing crops to fail through neglect or deliberate actions in order to collect insurance and that some insurance companies have not exercised due diligence in investigating losses and paying claims .
this act provided rma and usda's farm service agency ( fsa ) with new tools for monitoring and controlling program abuses .
these cases , totaling $3.1 million in insurance claims , were investigated by usda's office of inspector general ( oig ) and resulted in criminal prosecutions between june 2003 and april 2005 .
arpa required the secretary of agriculture to develop and implement a coordinated plan for fsa to assist rma in the ongoing monitoring of the crop insurance program and to use information technologies , such as data mining — the analysis of data to establish relationships and identify patterns — to administer and enforce the program .
it provides protection against financial losses caused by droughts , floods , or other natural disasters .
in summary , since the enactment of arpa , rma has taken a number of steps to improve its procedures and processes to prevent and detect fraud , waste , and abuse in the crop insurance program .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss usda's efforts to address fraud , waste , and abuse in the federal crop insurance program .
most notably , rma reports that data mining analyses and subsequent communication to farmers resulted in a decline of at least $300 million in questionable claims payments from 2001 to 2004 .
rma , which supervises the federal crop insurance corporation's ( fcic ) operations , has overall responsibility for administering the crop insurance program , including protecting against fraud , waste , and abuse .
however , we found that rma is not effectively using all of the tools it has available and that farmers and others can continue to take advantage of the program .
