china , as any other developing country , has needed foreign technology for its economicdevelopment .
for the first two post - revolution decades , china remained suspicious of foreigncapital and hoped that by importing foreign capital goods and using reverse engineering it could meetits technological needs .
 ( 14 ) the surge in fdi into china coincided with a similar trends worldwide .
between 1972 and 1978 , china imported equipment and a number of newplants from the industrialized west but found only limited success in developing indigenoustechnology through the reverse engineering route .
such a policy had limited success even after the opening of china followingpresident nixon's visit to beijing in 1972 and the gradual of normalization relations with the unitedstates and other nations .
 ( 12 ) in its designated priorityareas , the government also gives preferential treatment to foreign investors .
during the first stage ( 1979-83 ) , foreign investment was restricted to four special economic zones ( shenzhen , zhuhai , and shantou inguangdong province and xiamen in fujian province ) .
in 2001 , fdi inflows to china accounted for 6% of the world totaland 22% of inflows into developing economies .
in spite of the incentives provided , the inflowof fdi remained low - an average of only $360 million annually over the five - year period .
under deng xiaoping's economic reforms,attitudes toward foreign capital began to change .
the second half of 1990s saw an unprecedented increase in the world outflow of foreign capital - a more than six - foldincrease from an annual average of $225 billion during 1990-95 to $1,492 billion in 2000 .
these fdi flows have beenincreasing in recent years despite global recessionary conditions that caused total world fdi flowsto drop nearly by half in 2001 .
china's entry into the world trade organization in december 2001 also stimulated fdi flows intothe country .
these included five commitment areas related to the rule of lawreforms and implementation: ( 1 ) the consistent application of laws , regulations , and practices ; ( 2 ) protection of intellectual property rights ; ( 3 ) enforcement of contracts and judgement settlement ofdisputes ; ( 4 ) independence of judicial bodies ; and ( 5 ) equal treatment between chinese and foreignentities .
first , many governments liberalized capital flows into their national economies .
second,increasing costs of production and various technological developments induced enterprises to spreadtheir operations and risks internationally .
the process was further accelerated by theprivatization of government - owned enterprises in both developed and developing countries .
as shown in figure 2 , after averaging around $2 billion per year during1984-88 , fdi flows intochina rose dramatically in the 1990s to $46.9 billion in 2001 and further to $52.7 billion in 2002 ( according to chinese statistics ) .
they arealso expected to commit more first - time investments to china than to any other country .
according to the world investment report ( wir ) , there were three forces at work - all related toglobalization .
it eased export performance and domestic content requirements,attempted to make the legal framework more transparent , and ensured thatforeign - investment - related enterprises would not be nationalized except under special circumstances .
