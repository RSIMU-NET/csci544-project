pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has established regulations regarding the transport , treatment , storage , and disposal of hazardous wastes .
rcra establishes certain minimum standards that states must meet .
however , states have the option to implement requirements that are more stringent than those specified under rcra .
with increased legislative activity in the states , it is anticipated that stakeholders will increase their call for federal legislation regarding e - waste management .
as more states propose such legislation , potentially regulated stakeholders ( particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers ) have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with a patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states .
to date , 14 states have enacted some form of legislation or regulations that will affect e - waste recycling and disposal practices .
to illustrate the issues associated with individual state action , this report discusses the key issues that have led to state action , describes common elements in state waste laws and proposals , and provides an overview of each enacted state law .
many states have opted to do so â€” particularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households .
one goal common to both the hearings and the establishment of the working group was to explore potential national solutions to the e - waste management issue .
a challenge to many states is how to finance an e - waste collection and recycling program .
for example , leaded glass in a cathode ray tube ( crt ) may be recovered and reprocessed to produce new crts .
fourteen states have enacted some form of e - waste management law .
in 2005 , two congressional hearings were held to explore issues associated with e - waste , and the congressional e - waste working group was formed .
recycling may include any of a number of services or processes , such as: sorting to find reusable devices ( which may in turn be sold or donated to an entity such as a school or charitable organization ) ; demanufacturing into component parts that can be resold ; or further processing components to extract materials such as metals , glass , or plastic .
households and certain small businesses are essentially exempt from rcra .
however , most state laws and proposals have certain broad elements in common , such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law , how a collection and recycling program will be financed , collection and recycling criteria that must be implemented to minimize impacts on human health and the environment , and restrictions or requirements that products must meet to be lawfully sold in the state .
this means that under federal law , hazardous wastes generated by those entities may be disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills or incinerators .
aside from that similarity , each state's means of achieving its goals is significantly different .
if more than 10% of the total products collected are orphan products , the department must provide recommendations for reducing the amount of orphan products or alternative methods for financing the collection , transportation , and recycling of orphan products .
