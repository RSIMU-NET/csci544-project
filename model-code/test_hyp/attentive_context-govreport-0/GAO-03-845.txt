volatile prices , energy shortages , financial difficulties such as the bankruptcy of the enron corporation ( the nation's largest energy trading company before its financial problems ) , and accusations of price manipulation have raised questions about the transition to competitive markets and the federal government's ability to regulate and oversee these new markets to protect market participants and consumers .
the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) — the federal agency primarily responsible for regulating and overseeing these industries — will play an important role in developing competitive wholesale markets and in protecting consumers against market abuses .
the u.s. electricity and natural gas industries' transition to competitive markets has not been smooth .
to strengthen ferc's human capital plan , we recommend that the chairman of ferc revise the agency's plan to ( 1 ) identify specific activities , resources , and time frames to implement the human capital initiatives and ( 2 ) provide results - oriented measures to track the agency's progress in implementing the initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness .
in june 2002 , we reported that ferc had not yet adequately revised its regulatory and oversight approach to respond to the transition to competitive energy markets .
to determine ferc's progress in establishing an oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets , we focused our review on the formation and operation of omoi .
we also pointed out that ferc faced significant human capital and organizational structure challenges as it transformed its workforce to effectively regulate and oversee these evolving markets .
moreover , without results oriented measures , ferc will be unable to determine whether its initiatives are leading to better outcomes and achieving the desired effects , such as whether its workforce is better able to meet the challenges posed by competitive energy markets .
although ferc developed new performance measures for its market oversight goals and objectives for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 , the new measures are generally not outcome - oriented and do not lend themselves to assessing omoi's effectiveness .
it also does not contain results oriented performance measures that can help ferc measure progress toward achieving these objectives .
the plan also does not provide results - oriented performance measures to help ferc gauge its progress in achieving the plan's goals and objectives .
to help ensure that ferc's oversight of competitive energy markets is comprehensive and resources are effectively directed , we recommend that the chairman of ferc more clearly define omoi's role in overseeing the nation's energy markets by taking the following actions: explicitly describe omoi's activities relative to carrying out the agency's statutory requirements to ensure just and reasonable prices and to preventing market manipulation .
in light of ferc's stated commitment to and your interest in market oversight , you asked us to assess ferc's progress in ( 1 ) establishing an oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets and ( 2 ) improving agencywide human capital management .
for example , we noted that the agency did not have enough staff with knowledge of competitive energy markets , and that its market oversight function was too dispersed across the agency .
however , work remains to be done to ensure ferc's plan is successful .
