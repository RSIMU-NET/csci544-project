the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) — a semiautonomous agency within the department of energy ( doe ) — is responsible for managing the nation's nuclear security missions .
these missions include maintaining the safety , security , and effectiveness of the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile and reducing the threat posed by nuclear proliferation .
this report examines: ( 1 ) the extent to which doe and nnsa cost estimating requirements and guidance for its projects and programs reflect best practices for developing and reviewing cost estimates , and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa project and program reviews identified weaknesses in cost estimates , and the extent to which any weaknesses can be attributed to not following cost estimating best practices .
further , doe stated that the revised order will ( 1 ) define which doe and nnsa program budget requests require cost estimates and ( 2 ) clarify that cost estimates for program budget submissions shall be conducted in accordance with the doe cost estimating guide ( or its successor policy ) .
revise doe requirements and guidance that apply to programs to ensure that program reviews are conducted periodically , including reviews of the life - cycle cost estimates for programs .
to achieve its missions , nnsa manages numerous programs such as the stockpile life extension program and the plutonium disposition program .
these and other programs frequently rely on the acquisition of capital assets to meet program needs .
revise doe directives that apply to programs to require that doe and nnsa and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 cost estimating best practices , including developing life - cycle cost estimates for programs .
also , because doe order 413.3b has not been updated since 2010 , it omits reference to the supplemental cost estimating guide ; users of the order may not be aware of the guide's availability and may not benefit from its usefulness .
to enhance nnsa's ability to develop reliable cost estimates for its projects and for its programs that have project - like characteristics , we recommend the secretary of energy take the following five actions: revise doe's project management order to require that doe , nnsa , and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 cost estimating best practices .
as a result , reviews of cost estimates for programs are limited , and the extent to which program cost estimates have weaknesses is largely unknown .
because doe does not require the use of most of the 12 cost estimating best practices for its projects and programs , it is unlikely that nnsa and its contractors will consistently develop reliable cost estimates .
finally , without a requirement for conducting reviews of programs with project - like characteristics , including the life - cycle cost estimates of these programs , neither doe nor nnsa have appropriate internal controls to assess the quality of program performance over time .
nonetheless , nnsa continues to struggle with significant cost overruns on its major projects .
for example , to meet the needs of the plutonium disposition program , nnsa is currently managing the construction of two capital asset projects — the mixed oxide ( mox ) fuel fabrication facility and the waste solidification nnsa has a building — at doe's savannah river site in south carolina.history of struggling to complete these and other projects within their initial cost and schedule estimates .
