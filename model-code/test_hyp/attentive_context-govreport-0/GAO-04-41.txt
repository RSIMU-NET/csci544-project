as a result , we focused on four federal departments that support programs and other efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth: the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and its component agencies â€” cdc , substance abuse and mental health and services administration ( samhsa ) , national institutes of health ( nih ) , and health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) ; the department of defense ( dod ) ; the department of justice ( doj ) ; and the department of education ( education ) .
we focused our review on describing ( 1 ) programs , research , and activities that aim to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth , ( 2 ) the efforts of federal departments and agencies to monitor their programs , and ( 3 ) the coordination among federal departments and agencies in their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth .
in its most recent estimates of selected health consequences of cigarette smoking , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) reported that , on average , over 440,000 deaths and $76 billion in medical expenditures were attributable to cigarette smoking each year from 1995 through 1999 .
to do our work , we obtained and reviewed program documents , strategic and performance plans , pertinent program reports and special studies , surveillance and other data , and federal web sites from the department of health and human services ( hhs ) including the office of the secretary , the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation , office of public health and science , agency for healthcare research and quality , centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , centers for medicare & medicaid services , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , indian health service , national institutes of health ( nih ) , and substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) ; the departments of defense ( dod ) , justice ( doj ) , and education ; the environmental protection agency ; the federal trade commission ; and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) .
reducing the number of tobacco - related deaths , along with the associated costs , represents a significant public health challenge for the federal government .
tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the united states .
the first surgeon general's report to the congress that specifically focused on tobacco use among youth concluded that preventing youth from starting to use tobacco is key to reducing the deaths and incidence of disease attributable to tobacco use .
to identify federal programs , research , and activities that aim to address tobacco use among youth , we reviewed the catalog of federal domestic assistance , which is a database of federal grant programs , and other pertinent documents .
however , this effort has been delayed largely due to hrsa's competing funding priorities and limited resources .
given the harmful effects of tobacco use and the rates of smoking among youth , you asked us to provide information on federal efforts to prevent and reduce youth smoking .
to determine how federal departments and agencies coordinate their efforts , we reviewed their strategic plans and annual performance plans and reports and also descriptions of coordination efforts .
