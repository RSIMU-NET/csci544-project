in march 2003 , citing the failure of iraq to live up to agreements to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) , and other concerns , the united states and its coalition allies invaded iraq .
during late 2002 and early 2003 , the u.s. department of defense ( dod ) had made plans to find and eliminate the suspected wmd .
this report ( 1 ) assesses department of defense ( dod ) readiness to collect and secure radiological sources in iraq from the start of the 2003 war , ( 2 ) presents information on the number of radiological sources the defense threat reduction agency ( dtra ) secured by the time of the june 2004 transition to the interim iraqi government , ( 3 ) describes the assistance the united states has provided , and plans to provide in the future , to the iraqi government to help regulate radiological sources in iraq , and ( 4 ) examines dod and department of energy ( doe ) actions to assess their experiences in iraq and apply any lessons learned to possible future radiological source collection missions .
this report ( 1 ) assesses dod readiness to collect and secure radiological sources in iraq from the start of the 2003 war ; ( 2 ) presents information on the number of radiological sources dtra had secured by the time of the june 2004 transition to the interim iraqi government ; ( 3 ) describes the assistance the united states has provided , and plans to provide in the future , to the iraqi government to help regulate radiological sources in iraq ; and ( 4 ) examines dod and doe actions to assess their experiences in iraq and apply any lessons learned to possible future radiological source collection missions .
although dod has assessed its overall wmd mission in iraq , the agency has not assessed its narrower mission to collect and secure radiological sources .
dod's defense threat reduction agency ( dtra ) was to be responsible for hiring a contractor to dispose of wmd and their component materials , such as biological agents , chemicals , and radioactive materials .
because dod has not comprehensively reviewed its experiences in collecting and securing radiological sources in iraq , its current efforts to improve its preparations to secure or destroy wmd in future missions will not benefit from important lessons learned from its radiological source mission .
in addition , to ensure that planning and preparing for potential future missions is carried out in advance , we recommend that the secretary of defense provide specific guidance for collecting and securing radiological sources , including integrating the objective of collecting and securing radiological sources with military combat objectives , including specifying how security protection , if needed , would be provided to the organization with responsibility for managing radiological sources and whether combat troops would be required to secure sources and provide protection for operations to collect and secure radiological sources ; determining criteria to define which radiological sources ( 1 ) are of greatest risk and should be collected , ( 2 ) are being properly used and secured and thus can be left in place , and ( 3 ) pose minimal threat and thus do not need to be collected ; specifying the health and safety standards , after considering how u.s. standards for handling , securing , transporting , and disposing of radiological sources were modified for use in iraq ; officially designating the organization responsible within dod for collecting , securing , and disposing of sources and establishing agreements between that organization and other dod organizations that may be involved with these efforts ; establishing agreements and points of contact with doe and other federal agencies , as needed , to specify the coordination , technical expertise , equipment , and facilities that may be needed to collect and secure sources in , or remove them from , a foreign country ; identifying under which circumstances and for what purposes dod will contract with private firms to conduct activities to collect and secure radiological sources , and address legal and contracting issues to ensure the timely use of contractors ; and establishing guidelines concerning the role of radiological experts from the country where sources need to be collected and secured .
