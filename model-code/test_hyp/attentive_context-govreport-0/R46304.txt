the outbreak of coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) , first in the people's republic of china ( prc or china ) , and now globally , including in the united states , is drawing attention to the ways in which the united states and other ec onomies depend on critical manufacturing and global value chains that rely on production based in china .
congress is particularly concerned about these dependencies and has passed legislation to better understand and address them .
an area of particular concern to congress in the current environment is u.s. shortages of medical suppliesâincluding personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient u.s. industrial capacity .
suppressed global demand will likely further complicate efforts to orchestrate a rebound in china's ( or global ) economic activity .
because of china's role as a global supplier of ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( api ) , reduced exports from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states .
companies have sought to meet new government requirements for virus containment and faced worker and supply shortages as interregional logistics have remained constrained .
a key factor in the sharp economic slowdown in china was the dramatic downturn of both demand and supply after chinese officials imposed restrictions in the third week of january on movement of people and goods in and out of localities across china .
since the covid - 19 outbreak in china has eased , the chinese government's efforts to restart business activities has been slow and uneven across sectors and locations .
congress faces current choices that will influence the longer - range u.s. trade trajectory vis - a - vis china .
starting in early february 2020 , u.s. health care experts began warning of a likely global spread of covid - 19 , and early reports of u.s. medical supply shortages began to emerge .
current demand pressures during the covid - 19 pandemic could increase u.s. reliance on medical supplies from china , at least in the short term ( provided that the chinese government is willing to export these supplies to the united states ) .
as china's manufacturing sector recovers while the united states and other countries are grappling with covid - 19 , the chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery .
since the imposition of section 301 tariffs on u.s. imports from china and china's retaliatory tariffs beginning in 2018 , some members have raised questions about the dependence of u.s. supply chains on china for critical products .
in sectors where china has extensive capacity ( such as steel ) , some fear china could overwhelm overseas markets , as it ramps up export - led growth to compensate for the sharp economic downturn in the first quarter of 2020 .
in response , china shut down a large part of its economy in an effort to contain the outbreak .
resumption of bilateral trade will likely be uneven due to bottlenecks in inputs , locations of containers , and logjams in current shipments .
at the same time , the chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in china , directing all production for domestic use .
