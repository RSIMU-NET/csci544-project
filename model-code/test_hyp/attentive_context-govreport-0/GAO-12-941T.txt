however , it did not ( 1 ) identify funding necessary to achieve plan objectives or ( 2 ) establish monitoring mechanisms to determine progress and identify needed improvements .
while federal efforts to combat nuclear smuggling have largely focused on established ports of entry , such as seaports and land border crossings , dndo has also been examining nuclear detection strategies along other potential pathways in the architecture , including ( 1 ) land border areas between ports of entry into the united states , ( 2 ) international general aviation , and ( 3 ) small maritime craft , such as recreational boats and commercial fishing vessels .
this testimony discusses: ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to complete the deployment of radiation detection equipment to scan all cargo and conveyances entering the united states at ports of entry , ( 2 ) observations from our past work that may help dhs as it considers options for deploying new technologies to refurbish or replace existing portal monitors when they reach the end of their expected service lives , and ( 3 ) our assessment of the extent to which dhs has addressed our prior recommendations .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the efforts of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) to develop and deploy a global nuclear detection architecture ( gnda ) — an integrated system of radiation detection equipment and interdiction activities to combat nuclear smuggling in foreign countries , at the u.s. border , and inside the united states — and to provide an update on the deployment of radiation detection equipment at u.s. borders .
it is also responsible for developing , acquiring , and deploying radiation detection equipment to support the efforts of dhs and other federal agencies .
we stated that this plan should focus as we will discuss today , dhs has made meaningful progress in deploying radiation detection equipment at u.s. border crossings and seaports ; however , as deployed portal monitors begin to reach the end of their expected service lives , dhs will soon need to make decisions about whether to refurbish or replace them .
gao , customs service: acquisition and deployment of radiation detection equipment , gao - 03-235t ( washington , d.c.: oct. 17 , 2002 ) .
we reported , in july 2011 , that the gnda strategic plan addressed several of the aspects of our prior recommendations but did not ( 1 ) identify funding necessary to achieve plan objectives or ( 2 ) employ monitoring mechanisms to determine progress and identify needed improvements .
among other things , in july 2008 , we recommended that dhs develop an overarching strategic plan for the gnda that ( 1 ) clearly defines the objectives to be accomplished , ( 2 ) identifies the roles and responsibilities for meeting each objective , ( 3 ) identifies the funding necessary to achieve those objectives , and ( 4 ) employs monitoring mechanisms to determine programmatic progress and identify needed improvements .
to do so , we met with dhs , dndo , and customs and border protection ( cbp ) officials and reviewed dhs documents including the gnda strategic plan , the 2011 gnda joint annual interagency review , and the gnda implementation plan issued in april 2012 .
