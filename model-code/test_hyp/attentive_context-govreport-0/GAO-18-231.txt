the department of defense's ( dod ) 2005 round of base realignment and closure ( brac ) was the largest , costliest , and most complex of the five brac rounds since 1988 .
 ( recommendation 2 ) .
in contrast to prior rounds , which focused on the goal of reducing excess infrastructure , dod's goals for brac 2005 also included transforming the military and fostering joint activities across the military departments .
since 2005 , we have issued more than 40 reports and testimonies on brac 2005 planning , implementation , costs , and savings ; this work highlights information dod can use to improve its process for developing and implementing brac recommendations .
by implementing the 198 recommendations approved by the 2005 brac commission , dod closed 23 major bases , realigned 24 major bases , combined 26 installations into 12 joint bases , and eliminated about 12,000 civilian positions .
congress has not authorized additional brac rounds to date .
after implementing these brac 2005 recommendations , in 2017 dod estimated that it continued to have significant excess capacity remaining .
 ( matter for consideration 1 ) .
in the department's brac 2005 report , the secretary of defense stated that brac 2005 provided dod a unique opportunity to address new challenges posed by international terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , ungoverned areas , rogue states , and nonstate actors .
if congress would like to increase its oversight for any future brac round , requiring dod to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness and track achievement of its goals would provide it with improved visibility over the expected outcomes .
congress should consider , in any future brac authorization , a requirement for dod to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness and to track the achievement of its goals .
for example , in our march 2013 report on lessons learned from the brac 2005 round , we found that dod's process for providing the brac commission with cost and savings estimates was hindered by underestimating requirements .
selected economic indicators for the 20 communities surrounding the 23 department of defense ( dod ) installations closed in the 2005 base realignment and closure ( brac ) round vary compared to national averages .
specifically , for the brac analysis phase , dod implemented 1 of 12 recommendations , and it has agreed to implement another 7 recommendations should congress authorize any future brac round .
dod generally agreed with 32 and did not concur with 7 recommendations .
to address remaining excess capacity , between 2013 and 2017 dod requested additional brac rounds and , in february 2018 , stated that it would work with congress to find common areas where reforms and changes could be made .
dod has implemented 33 of the 65 prior recommendations that we identified in our work since 2004 , and it has the opportunity to address additional challenges regarding communications and monitoring to improve any future brac round .
in this report , we assess the extent that dod ( 1 ) measured the achievement of its goals for reducing excess infrastructure , transforming the military , and promoting jointness for brac 2005 and ( 2 ) implemented prior gao recommendations and addressed any additional challenges faced in brac 2005 to improve performance for any future brac round .
