although the 11 th recession of the postwar period officially ended in june 2009 , one economic indicator that is very visible in people's daily lives — the unemployment rate — has continued to rise .
with the unemployment rate at 9.8% in november 2010 , those still employed or able to find jobs are quite likely to know personally others who have been less fortunate .
this report addresses the question of when one might reasonably expect to see sustained improvement in the unemployment rate and a steady resumption of job growth following a recession's end .
the unemployment rate kept rising for nine months after the end of the december 1969-november 1970 recession , 15 months after the end of the july 1990-march 1991 recession , and 18 months after the end of the march - november 2001 recession .
to begin with , the official definition of the unemployment rate prescribed by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) is the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed .
while employment at firms in the private sector of the economy started to steadily rise in january 2010 , it appears that the fiscal problems of local governments in particular have dampened the pace of overall job growth .
before employers are fairly certain that the increase in demand for their goods and services will continue , they are likely to boost production by restoring the hours of those currently in their employ and by having employees work overtime rather than by hiring new workers or recalling laid off workers .
in sharp contrast , steady job growth did not commence until march 1992 — 12 months after the july 1990-march 1991 recession ended ; and not until september 2003 — 22 months after the march - november 2001 recession ended .
firms usually are reluctant to add workers to their payrolls until convinced that the economy will continue growing ( i.e. , gross domestic product , gdp , will keep increasing ) .
sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries .
mathematically , the unemployment rate is expressed as: the unemployment rate consequently may move up or down depending not just on a change in the number of workers who lack jobs ( the numerator ) but also on a change in the number of individuals participating in the labor force ( the denominator ) .
with employment at public and private sector employers similarly having failed to show consistent improvement for well over a year since the recession's end , many observers think the nation has been experiencing another jobless recovery .
in addition , the business cycle dating committee appears to rely chiefly on changes in both national output ( gdp ) and employment trends from the establishment survey to determine the official beginning and end of recessions .
