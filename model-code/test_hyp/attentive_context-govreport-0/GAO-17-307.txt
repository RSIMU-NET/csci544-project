specifically , this report examines the extent to which blm ( 1 ) approved requests for exceptions from lease and permit requirements intended to mitigate environmental impacts , and how these decisions were made and documented ; ( 2 ) involved the public in the development of lease and permit requirements and in the approval of exception requests ; and ( 3 ) implemented its best management practices policy and assessed its effectiveness in mitigating environmental impacts .

this appendix details the methods we used to assess the department of the interior's bureau of land management's ( blm ) efforts to mitigate environmental impacts from oil and gas activities .
establish a policy requiring staff responsible for conducting environmental and monitoring inspections to take standardized training .
development of the nation's domestic sources of oil and gas on federal , state , and private land continues to make a critical contribution to our nation's energy supply .
at the same time , the effect of this development on the environment — including wildlife — and surrounding communities has generated concern among some federal and state government officials and conservationists .
the bureau of land management ( blm ) , within the department of the interior ( interior ) , is responsible for managing oil and gas resources that lie under federal and private land for which the federal government retains mineral rights .
this included examining ( 1 ) how the request was made ; ( 2 ) who at blm reviewed the request ; ( 3 ) what the applicable blm criteria were , if any ; ( 4 ) whether blm provided an explanation of its decision ; and ( 5 ) how blm communicated the decision to the operator .
improving blm's monitoring inspection program could allow the agency to better assess environmental impacts of oil and gas development and the effectiveness of efforts to mitigate such impacts .
blm has generally implemented its best management practices policy by including key practices as permit requirements .
you asked us to review blm's efforts to mitigate the environmental impacts of oil and gas development .
blm has generally implemented its best management practices policy by including key practices as permit requirements .
the extent to which blm approves requests for exceptions to environmentally related lease and permit requirements is unknown because blm does not have comprehensive or consistent data on these requests .
further , blm field offices have not effectively used monitoring inspection data to assess the effectiveness of best management practices to mitigate environmental impacts of oil and gas development .
provide additional guidance to field offices on how to collect and use data collected during monitoring inspections and , in doing so , determine and implement an approach for using the data to assess the effectiveness of the agency's mitigation efforts , including its best management practices .
