the various systems that collect , process , and disseminate intelligence are encompassed inthe budget category known as intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ( 1 ) ) .
the bulk of funding is forresearch and development ( r&d ) and procurement ; personnel costs are comparatively low .
 ( 2 ) isr acquisition has in recent years come under strong criticism .
the isrprograms considered in this report are managed by the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and by thelarge intelligence agencies and components of the department of defense ( dod ) .
somesystems are used only by military units ; others are national systems operated by washington - leveldefense agencies .
isr covers a multitude ofprograms ranging from billion - dollar satellites to hand - held cameras .
reportedly , there aretechnical problems with the new generation of reconnaissance satellites , along with billion dollarcost - overruns ; only a small number of the planned high - altitude uavs are actually deployed ; andthere have been difficulties in ensuring that the troops who need intelligence acquire it in a timelymanner .
appendix a provides a case studyof the trade - offs between satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) .
it is difficult to ensure efficient acquisition in theseparate programs which are often based on innovative technologies .
it is even more challengingto envision a seamless and comprehensive system of systems and to ensure the acquisition of anoptimal mix of specific systems .
most are surrounded in secrecy , but total spending on isr , while difficult toestimate with unclassified information , undoubtedly runs into the tens of billions of dollars .
some observers point to the possibility that satellites and uavs potentiallyundertake the same or similar missions , but that the current system gives little opportunity for costcomparisons or trade - offs to be made in the acquisition process .
understanding the procedures for acquiring isr systems is , however , complicated by the factthat different isr systems are acquired in entirely different ways , by different intelligence agenciesor military services , and are designed for different users .
there is a widespread awareness that isr spending , much greater than in past years , couldeasily absorb even larger portions of defense and intelligence budgets , making the need for tradeoffseven more important .
 ( 3 ) some believed that giving the dci greater management responsibilities would improve themanagement of isr programs , including those in the department of defense ( dod ) .
in addition , the acquisition processes areoverseen by different congressional committees .
 ( 6 ) in may 2000 , the senate intelligence committee reported that , "the budget practices of the[central intelligence agency ( cia ) ] and the intelligence community as a whole are simplyinadequate to address current requirements .
 ( 7 ) the next year the committee again argued that the intelligence community "is handicappedby the lack of comprehensive strategic and performance plans that can be used to articulate programgoals , measure program performance , improve program efficiency and aid in resource planning. .
in 1995 , the senate selectcommittee on intelligence ( ssci ) expressed its misgivings about existing cooperation amongagencies and recommended a joint review by the director of central intelligence ( dci ) and thedeputy secretary of defense to ensure that "both intelligence community and defense departmentequities are served in the planning , programming , and management of all intelligence activities andprograms. .
