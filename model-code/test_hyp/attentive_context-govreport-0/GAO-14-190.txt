in this third report , we ( 1 ) evaluate program progress toward cost , schedule , and performance goals ; ( 2 ) identify program development challenges , if any , and steps to address these challenges ; and ( 3 ) assess progress in manufacturing aircraft .
these activities include ( 1 ) identifying key system characteristics and critical manufacturing processes ; ( 2 ) establishing a reliability growth plan and goals ; ( 3 ) conducting failure modes and effects analysis ; ( 4 ) conducting reliability growth testing ; and ( 5 ) determining whether processes are in control and capable .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) progress toward cost , schedule , and performance goals ; ( 2 ) development challenges , if any , and steps to address them ; and ( 3 ) progress in manufacturing the aircraft .
due to existing schedule risks and the fact that the program is entering a challenging phase of testing , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the air force to study the likelihood and potential effect of delays on total development costs , and develop mitigation plans , as needed , related to potential delays .
the kc - 46 tanker modernization program , valued at $51 billion , is the air force's highest acquisition priority .
to conduct work for our current review , we analyzed financial management documents ; program budgets ; risk assessments ; technical performance indicators ; flight test and manufacturing plans ; and software development plan and metrics .
this report examines the air force's continued development of the kc - 46 tanker program .
the program recently completed its third year in development to convert an aircraft designed for commercial use into an aerial refueling tanker .
dod has since reviewed the use of management reserves and is conducting schedule risk assessments .
in our first report , we recommended that the department of defense ( dod ) track lessons learned , since the kc - 46 is one of the few major programs to award a fixed price incentive ( firm target ) development contract in recent years .
the kc - 46 program office conducts an annual analysis of cost and schedule risks to quantify the potential effect of delays on program costs and officials told us they will consider the risks we identified in that analysis .
in our second report , we recommended that dod analyze the root causes for the rapid allocation of management reserves ( funds set aside to address development risks ) and improve the kc - 46 master schedule to comply with best practices .
we have not yet assessed testing results and plans to correct identified deficiencies because flight testing has not officially begun .
this force is now over 50 years old on average and costs increasingly more to maintain and support , with additional concerns that age - related problems could potentially ground the fleet .
aerial refueling — the transfer of fuel from airborne tankers to combat and airlift forces — is critical to the u.s. military's ability to project power overseas and to effectively operate within a combat theater .
we also interviewed program officials to determine the status of department of defense ( dod ) efforts to implement our prior recommendations aimed at improving the program's integrated master schedule .
