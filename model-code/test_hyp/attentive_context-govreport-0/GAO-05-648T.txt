i appreciate the opportunity to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on the implementation of the freedom of information act ( foia ) .
specific requests by the public for information through the act have led to disclosure of waste , fraud , abuse , and wrongdoing in the government , as well as the identification of unsafe consumer products , harmful drugs , and serious health hazards .
generally speaking , foia establishes that federal agencies must provide the public with access to government information , thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions .
to help ensure appropriate implementation , the act requires that agencies report annually to the attorney general , providing specific information about their foia operations .
at that time we recommended that justice ( 1 ) encourage agencies to make material electronically available and ( 2 ) review agency annual reports to address specific data quality issues .
to assess implementation of foia , we examined , consolidated , and analyzed annual report data for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 from 25 major agencies ( herein we refer to this scope as governmentwide ) .
agencies other than va that reported receiving large numbers of requests in fiscal year 2004 included the social security administration ( ssa ) , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , as shown in figure 3 .
the department of justice and the office of management and budget ( omb ) both have roles in the implementation of foia .
to develop a description of the foia process at federal agencies , we compiled and analyzed information from department of justice documentation and from our previous reports .
as requested , in my remarks today , i will describe the foia process at federal agencies and discuss the implementation of foia .
given this steadily increasing workload , it will remain critically important that strong oversight of foia implementation continue in order to ensure that agencies remain responsive to the needs of citizens .
the department of justice oversees agencies' compliance with foia and is the primary source of policy guidance for agencies .
since our report was issued , justice has taken steps to implement both of these recommendations .
they include the 24 major agencies covered by the chief financial officers act , as well as the central intelligence agency and , beginning in 2003 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) in place of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) .
only relatively small numbers were partially granted ( 3 percent ) , denied ( 1 percent ) , or not disclosed for other reasons ( 5 percent ) .
in addition , agencies are required to meet certain time frames for making key determinations: whether to comply with requests ( 20 business days from receipt of the request ) , responses to appeals of adverse determinations ( 20 business days from filing of the appeal ) , and whether to provide expedited processing of requests ( 10 business days from receipt of the request ) .
within the department of justice , the office of information and privacy ( oip ) has lead responsibility for providing guidance and support to federal agencies on foia issues .
