congress's decisions on these issues could affect future u.s. military capabilities and funding requirements .
in fy2021 , the department of defense ( dod ) requested approximately $4.1 billion for more than 41,337 weapons in 15 munitions programs .
potential issues for congress include planned procurement quantities and stockpile assessments , defense industrial base production capacity , development timelines , supply chain security , affordability and cost - effectiveness , and emerging factors that may affect pgm programs .
congress , through the defense authorization and appropriations bills , has historically exercised its role in the decision to approve , reject , or modify dod's proposals for pgms .
over the years , the u.s. military has relied on pgms to execute ground , air , and naval military operations .
pgms have become ubiquitous in u.s. military operations ; funding for these weapons has increased dramatically from fy1998 to the present as depicted in .
this report focuses on selected precision - guided munitions ( pgms ) fielded by the air force , army , navy , and marine corps .
in addition , these programs pose a number of potential oversight issues for congress .
dod projects requesting approximately $3.3 billion for 20,456 weapons in fy2022 , $3.9 billion for 23,306 weapons in fy2023 , $3.9 billion for 18,376 weapons in fy2024 , and $3.6 billion for 16,325 weapons in fy2025 .
the main disadvantage of these weapons is cost ; particularly long range missiles .
a related issue is whether dod has adequately assessed the sufficiency of existing and planned pgm stockpiles , particularly in light of recent use rates for such weapons .
affordability and cost - effectiveness .
one potential issue for congress is whether dod's desired quantities of standoff munitions are appropriate .
in addition to these virtues , pgms also offer other advantages over unguided weapons , namely range and the reduction in numbers of combat sorties required to deliver the desired effects on the battle field .
china and russia have developed sophisticated systems over the past 10 years , while dod has developed relatively few systems .
some analysts argue that u.s. forces would substantially increase their operational risk at ranges in excess of 500 nautical miles ( nm ) .
another potential issue for congress is how dod's programs for developing and procuring pgms might be affected by emerging factors such as the u.s. withdrawal from the intermediate nuclear force ( inf ) treaty ; new u.s. military operational concepts for countering chinese a2 / ad forces in the indo - pacific region , such as the army's new multi - domain operations ( mdo ) operational concept and the marine corps' new expeditionary advanced base operations ( eabo ) concept , both of which possibly feature the potential use of such weapons from island locations in the pacific as a way of countering china's a2 / ad forces ; and emerging technologies such as hypersonics and artificial intelligence ( ai ) .
counter - islamic state ( is ) operations in iraq and syria have used numerous weapons: in 2015 , coalition air forces used more than 28,000 weapons ; in 2016 , the campaign used an additional 30,700 weapons ; and in 2017 ( the height of operations ) , the campaign used 39,500 weapons ( see figure 2 for a graphical representation of operational usage compared to dod procurement ) .
