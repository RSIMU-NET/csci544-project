this report examines ( 1 ) what is known about primary and secondary online ticket sales , ( 2 ) the consumer protection concerns that exist related to online ticket sales , and ( 3 ) potential advantages and disadvantages of selected approaches to address these concerns .
the better online ticket sales act of 2016 ( bots act ) restricted the use of bots and gave the federal trade commission ( ftc ) and state attorneys general the authority to pursue violators with civil actions .
the objectives of this report were to examine ( 1 ) what is known about primary and secondary online ticket sales , ( 2 ) the consumer protection concerns that exist related to online ticket sales , and ( 3 ) potential advantages and disadvantages of selected approaches to address these concerns .
as such , no activity , outside of expanding the supply , is likely to effectively address one key source of consumer dissatisfaction: that tickets are not available to popular sold - out events .
for example , some consumers have complained about difficulty obtaining face - value tickets for popular events at the primary , or initial , sale to the general public — only to find the tickets immediately available at high markups on the secondary , or resale , market .
although the council can play a role in monitoring deceptive advertising related to ticketing , it also faces constraints — for example , it addresses practices case - by - case and its recommendations depend on voluntary compliance by the advertiser .
other issues that have been raised include the amount of ticket fees and restrictions on transferring some tickets .
in recent years , consumers and others have raised issues about the online ticket marketplace for concerts , commercial theater , and sporting events .
you asked us to review the marketplace and consumer protection issues related to online ticket sales .
some industry players are implementing technological and market - based approaches that seek to address concerns about secondary market activity .
no matter what efforts are made to address concerns about the ticket marketplace , some of the consumer dissatisfaction with event ticketing stems from an intractable issue: demand for tickets to highly popular events exceeds supply .
to address the second objective , we reviewed the websites of 6 primary market ticket sellers , 11 secondary ticket exchanges , and 8 ticket sellers using “white - label” websites .
we also reviewed trade industry data on ticket prices and sales .
we also reviewed foreign government reports to obtain information on relevant ticketing restrictions in two foreign countries ( canada and the united kingdom ) with similar consumer protection issues reviewed in this report .
in addition , the advertising industry's self - regulatory organization has taken steps to address potentially misleading pricing practices in the ticket industry .
federal agencies face constraints in addressing ticketing issues .
in response , event organizers and legislators have targeted ticket bots — automated software that ticket brokers can use to buy large volumes of tickets .
as noted earlier , the organization recently referred a major ticket company to ftc for not following its recommendations to conspicuously disclose its fees .
similar legislation has been introduced in several other states in recent years .
