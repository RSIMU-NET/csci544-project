in the over 18 months since the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) was enacted in february 2009 , the department of the treasury has paid out approximately $154.8 billion in recovery act funds for use in states and localities .
these funds have been used to support and preserve services in a wide range of areas including health , education , transportation , and housing .
in this report , the seventh in a series in response to the act's mandate , we update and add new information on the following: ( 1 ) selected states' and localities' uses of recovery act funds , ( 2 ) the approaches taken by the selected states and localities to ensure accountability for recovery act funds , and ( 3 ) states' plans to evaluate the impact of the recovery act funds they receive .
specifically , the stated purposes of the recovery act are to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery ; assist those most impacted by the recession ; provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health ; invest in transportation , environmental protection , and other infrastructure that will provide long - term economic benefits ; and stabilize state and local government budgets in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases .
in this report , we also discuss state and local budget use of recovery act funds ; federal requirements and guidance ; and oversight , transparency , and accountability issues related to the recovery act and its implementation .
the recovery act's recurring mandate specifies several roles for gao , including conducting bimonthly reviews of how recovery act funds are being used in selected states and whether they are achieving the stated purposes of the act .
this report focuses on the following programs: federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) ; state fiscal stabilization fund ( sfsf ) ; title i , part a of the elementary and secondary act of 1965 as amended ( esea ) ; parts b and c of the individuals with disabilities education act , as amended ( idea ) ; federal - aid highway surface transportation and transit capital state energy program ( sep ) ; energy efficiency and conservation block grant ( eecbg ) program ; weatherization assistance program ; public housing capital fund ; tax credit assistance program ( tcap ) ; and grants to states for low - income housing projects in lieu of low - income housing credits program under section 1602 of division b of the recovery act ( section 1602 program ) .
as in our previous reports , we collected and reported data on programs receiving substantial recovery act funds in 16 selected states , certain localities , and the district of columbia , and made recommendations when changes could result in improvements .
our oversight of programs funded by the recovery act has resulted in more than 62 recovery act related products .
departments of health and human services ( centers for medicare and medicaid services ) , education , transportation , energy , and housing and urban development .
given that , as of september 3 , 2010 , more than half — about $154.8 billion of the approximately $282 billion — of total recovery act funds for programs administered by states and localities had been paid out by the federal government , evolving to this approach is appropriate and will allow us to provide congress and other decision makers with more in - depth analyses of programs funded by the recovery act and to be responsive to congressional interest in the impact and outcomes of programs as recovery act implementation moves forward .
