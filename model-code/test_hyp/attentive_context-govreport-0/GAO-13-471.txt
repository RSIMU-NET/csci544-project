over the past three decades , federal agencies and state and local governments have established a number of entities ( e.g. , units , centers , and task forces ) nationwide that may — in all or in part — collect , process , analyze , or disseminate information in support of law enforcement and counterterrorism - related efforts .
the federal government — specifically , the department of justice ( doj ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) — operates or , through grant funding or personnel , supports five types of these field - based information - sharing entities .
sustaining a national information - sharing capability to efficiently and effectively gather , analyze , and disseminate law enforcement , public safety , and terrorism - related information is critical to our nation's efforts to combat criminal and terrorist threats .
specifically , these include the following: joint terrorism task forces ( jttf ) , which are funded and managed by doj's federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , aim to prevent , preempt , deter , and investigate terrorism and related activities affecting the united states as well as to apprehend terrorists .
this report addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which these field - based entities are distinct , fragmented , overlapping , or potentially duplicative ; ( 2 ) the extent to which doj , dhs , and ondcp hold these entities accountable for coordination and have assessed opportunities for coordination to reduce overlap and duplication and what practices , if any , select entities have reported using to coordinate and achieve efficiencies ; and ( 3 ) how , if at all , doj , dhs , and ondcp incorporate information they collect on the results that these field - based entities achieve when making funding decisions for them .
we have previously reported that defining and articulating a common outcome ; developing mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results ; and reinforcing agency accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports can help enhance and sustain coordinated efforts among agencies .
state and major urban area fusion centers ( fusion centers ) , which are funded through a variety of federal and state sources , including in part through dhs and doj grants , are state and locally - owned and operated to serve as intermediaries for sharing terrorism and other threat - related information between the federal government and state , local , tribal , territorial , and private sector homeland security partners .
regional information sharing systems ( riss ) centers , which are funded through grants administered by doj's bureau of justice assistance ( bja ) , support regional law enforcement , public safety , and homeland security efforts to , among other things , combat major crimes and terrorist activity , and promote officer safety by linking federal , state , local , and tribal criminal justice agencies through secure communications and providing information - sharing resources and analytical and investigative support .
the results of this assessment could be used by the agencies to provide recommendations or guidance to the entities to create coordinated governance boards or colocate entities , which can result in increased efficiencies through shared facilities and resources and reduced overlap through coordinated or collaborative products , activities , and services .
