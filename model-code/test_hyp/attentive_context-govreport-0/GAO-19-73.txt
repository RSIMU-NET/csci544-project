 ( recommendation 6 ) .
at a minimum , this strategy should establish time frames and performance metrics for addressing risks related to ( 1 ) unfilled real property positions , ( 2 ) a lack of a department - wide approach to improving its data , and ( 3 ) implementation of osd's expanded data platform .
the department of defense ( dod ) manages a portfolio of real property assets that reportedly included about 568,000 facilities with a combined plant replacement value of about $1 trillion and nearly 27.2 million acres of land in fiscal year 2016 .
for this report , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) rpad accurately and completely reflects dod's real property assets ; ( 2 ) dod has processes to help ensure the accuracy and completeness in recording and reporting real property data ; and ( 3 ) dod has addressed the risks that may affect use of real property information for managing its assets .
 ( recommendation 5 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment , in collaboration with the military services , develops a strategy that identifies and addresses risks to data quality and information accessibility .
each of the military services and dod's washington headquarters services ( whs ) maintains its own data systems that include information about each of the real property assets .
in january 2018 , the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) testified that reform efforts within dod , such as those occurring in real property management , were dependent upon accurate data and that not having accurate data complicates those efforts .
dod has begun to implement actions in response to our recommendations but has not fully completed the corrective actions .
dod's efforts to reform its real property management is complicated by not having quality data on its large inventory of assets — over 568,000 facilities with an estimated combined plant replacement value of about $1 trillion .
dod also has not developed a strategy that establishes time frames and performance metrics to address risks to data quality and information accessibility .
in written comments , dod concurred with four recommendations and partially concurred with three recommendations .
specifically , dod faces risks related to unfilled real property positions , a lack of a department - wide approach to improving data , and a limited plan for implementation of osd's expanded data platform .
an accurate and complete inventory of its assets is essential for dod to make informed management decisions about its real property .
without a strategy to address these risks , dod is missing an opportunity to ensure that the information needed for effective decision making , such as budget decisions and oversight by congress , is available to meet real property accountability and reporting objectives and to avoid inefficient and potentially costly workarounds , such as additional data calls to installations .
for example , in 1997 , we added dod's defense support infrastructure to our list of high - risk areas in the federal government — due in part to long standing challenges it faces in managing its infrastructure — to include the need to improve the quality of its information in its inventory data systems .
