representation , gao - 01-839 ( washington , d.c.: july 27 , 2001 ) .
in 2001 , we reported and had not developed action plans or strategies for representation the equitable representation of americans at un organizations .
we recommended that the secretary of state ( 1 ) develop a comprehensive strategy that specifies performance goals and time frames for achieving equitable representation of americans in the un system and include efforts to foster interagency coordination , ( 2 ) work with human resources directors of un organizations to develop plans and strategies for achieving equitable geographic representation within specified time frames , and ( 3 ) provide copies of state's annual report to congress on un progress to the heads of un organizations for appropriate attention and action .
we reviewed five un organizations: the un secretariat ; international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) ; un educational , scientific , and cultural organization ( unesco ) ; office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) ; and un development program ( undp ) .
state also has increased its efforts to improve overall u.s. representation , including adding staff to its un employment office and increasing coordination with other u.s. agencies ; however , despite these efforts , u.s. representation in entry - level positions has declined or did not reflect a trend in four of the five un agencies we reviewed .
because equitable representation of americans employed at un organizations has been a high priority for u.s. interests , we recommend that the secretary of state take the following three actions: provide more consistent and comprehensive information about un employment on the state and u.s. mission web sites and work with u.s. agencies to expand the un employment information on their web sites .
state has subsequently implemented these recommendations , including adding a performance indicator on the un's employment of americans to its performance and accountability documents .
we also discussed u.s. strategies and efforts for increasing u.s. representation with un personnel officials and american employees of un organizations .
while state increased its resources and activities in recent years to support increased u.s. representation overall , additional actions to facilitate the employment of americans in entry - and mid - level professional positions are needed to overcome declining u.s. employment in these positions and meet employment targets .
