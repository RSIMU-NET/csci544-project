key issues for congress include the authorization and appropriation of u.s. aid to africa , the authorization and appropriation of funds for u.s. military activities on the continent , and oversight of u.s. programs and policies .
the 115 th congress and the trump administration are reviewing existing u.s. policies and programs in sub - saharan africa ( henceforth , "africa" ) as they establish their budgetary and policy priorities toward the region while also responding to emerging crises .
growth in many countries has slowed since 2015 , however , and most african countries still face significant development challenges .
long - running civil conflicts continue to affect parts of the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) , somalia , and sudan , while newer conflicts have unfolded in recent years in the lake chad basin , the central african republic ( car ) , mali , and south sudan .
among the factors that hinder investment and economic growth are poor governance and infrastructure , poverty and low domestic demand , a lack of skilled labor , limited access to inputs and capital , political instability , and insecurity .
much of africa experienced rapid economic growth starting in the early 2000s , which spurred middle class expansion .
in support of congressional deliberations , this report provides background on select issues related to africa and u.s. policy in the format of frequently asked questions .
three african countries — south sudan , nigeria , and somalia — face famine or a credible risk of famine in 2017 ; in each case , security - related restrictions have hindered humanitarian access to the affected populations .
in 2012 , the obama administration released a policy document entitled u.s. strategy toward sub - saharan africa , which prioritized as u.s. goals the strengthening of democratic institutions ; the expansion of economic growth , trade , and investment ; the advancement of peace and security ; and the promotion of opportunity and development .
these include unmet needs for health , education , and other social services — particularly for large youth populations — as well as climate and environmental shocks .
congressional responses to emerging crises , such as famine concerns in three african countries , increasingly intractable conflicts in south sudan and mali ( among others ) , transnational security threats , and the appropriate balance between u.s. diplomacy , development , and defense priorities in africa , may also influence or direct u.s. policy .
enhancing democracy , the rule of law , and respect for human rights in the region have long been u.s. policy priorities , often as mandated by congress .
in a number of african countries , porous borders , weak state institutions , and corruption have created permissive environments for transnational threats , including terrorism , illicit trafficking , and maritime piracy .
armed conflict and instability continue to threaten regional security , impede development , and contribute to widespread human suffering and humanitarian crises .
the obama administration pursued several global development initiatives that sought to benefit africa , as well as a number of africa - specific initiatives and major programs .
u.s. efforts to promote democracy , human rights , and economic development on the continent have been pursued through the use of diplomacy , foreign aid or restrictions on assistance , preferential tariff treatment , or the sanctioning or prosecution of human rights violators , often under close congressional oversight .
