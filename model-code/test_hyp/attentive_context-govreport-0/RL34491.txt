the senate's emphasis on individual and minority rights , reflected in both its standing rules and chamber custom , can make it challenging for the chamber to achieve its various goals in a timely manner .
for this reason , the senate routinely chooses to set aside its standing rules by unanimous consent .
many of the pairs ( or groups ) are competing options for the same policy issue .
these amendments or measures are sometimes of a controversial nature with potential to be subjected to extended consideration or even a filibuster .
this is done formally through uc agreements , which in many cases outline the terms under which specific legislation will be considered .
lastly , in many of these 60-vote threshold uc agreements , it is a pair ( or group ) of amendments or measures that are jointly held to the 60-vote requirement .
under recent practice , these uc agreements sometimes include a provision imposing a 60-vote requirement for approval of amendments or legislation , instead of the simple majority vote ordinarily required in the senate .
the 60-vote threshold in a uc agreement has the effect of bypassing the procedural vote to grant senators a direct vote on the policy issue at hand .
for a cloture vote to be successful , in most cases three - fifths of all senators must vote in the affirmative ( i.e. , 60 votes if there are no vacancies ) .
second , for cases in which a large majority either in favor of or against the question cannot be assumed , the 60-vote threshold accomplishes the same purpose as a filibuster by preventing or delaying passage , but without requiring the senate to engage in extended debate .
in the senate , most points of order under the budget act may be waived by a vote of at least three - fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn ( 60 votes if there are no vacancies ) .
thus , surrendering the right to filibuster may be more palatable if senators are confident a measure will not pass without super - majority support .
as with all uc agreements , once agreed to , they can be altered only by the adoption of a further uc agreement .
votes on cloture often fail and consequently a vote on the actual measure or amendment may never occur .
it is notable that unlike senate rules requiring super majorities , which typically are framed in terms of a fraction either of the membership or those voting ( e.g. , two - thirds , three - fifths ) , these uc agreements explicitly state the number of votes required .
several possible effects could result from the senate choosing to impose a 60-vote threshold for the passage of legislation .
first , for cases in which a large majority of senators is in favor of or opposed to the question , the time that would ordinarily be required to invoke cloture can be avoided .
this allows the senate to debate and choose between contending alternatives in a timely and controlled manner .
such uc agreements ensure that a measure will not be successful without the same level of super - majority support that would be required for cloture by stipulating that if the 60-vote threshold is not reached , the matter will be disposed of .
