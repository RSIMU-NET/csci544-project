i am pleased to be here today to discuss the challenges that face the national archives and records administration ( nara ) and federal agencies in their efforts to manage the rapidly increasing volume of electronic records .
consistent , sustained oversight from congress â€“ through avenues such as today's hearing - - is needed to ensure that records management policies and practices keep pace with today's environment .
records generated electronically , such as electronic mail ( e - mail ) messages , word processing documents , cd roms , and world wide web site pages , present special archival challenges for nara and the agencies because these technologies are new and constantly changing .
also , because of the wide variance in electronic records management ( erm ) policies and practices at four agencies we visited , we recommended that nara conduct a baseline survey of all agencies as a part of its planned business process reengineering ( bpr ) effort .
in that report , we noted that nara and the agencies must address several hardware and software issues to ensure that electronic records are properly created , permanently maintained , secured , and retrievable in the future .
nara had earlier planned to do such a survey but has decided to postpone it because the archivist gave higher priority to such activities as bpr .
such oversight is essential to help nara ensure that the official records of our country are properly maintained and preserved .
we continue to believe nara's bpr effort would benefit from a complete baseline assessment survey of all agencies' records management capabilities .
some of nara's actions have been taken as a result of a court decision , which held that nara's guidance for the deletion of electronic records exceeded statutory authority .
nara has taken actions to address the agencies' immediate needs for erm guidance and direction - - revising its bulletins and other guidance as well as forming a new group to help answer agencies' questions on erm issues .
the survey would have identified best practices at agencies and collected data on ( 1 ) program management and records management infrastructure , ( 2 ) guidance and training , ( 3 ) scheduling and implementation , and ( 4 ) electronic recordkeeping .
however , there has been no recent governmentwide survey to determine the extent of agencies' erm programs and capabilities or their compliance with the federal records act .
my testimony today centers on our report to the senate governmental affairs committee in july 1999 .
scheduled to take 18 to 24 months - - is completed .
nara would also be in a better position in later years to assess the impacts of its bpr effort .
instead , nara plans to collect information from a small , judgmentally selected sample of agencies .
nara must provide guidance and assistance to federal agencies on the creation , maintenance , use , and disposition of government records .
agencies must incorporate nara's guidance into their own recordkeeping systems .
for example , australia has strong central authority and decentralized custody of records , and it maintains a governmentwide locator system .
nara's bpr will address its internal processes as well as guidance and interactions with agencies .
