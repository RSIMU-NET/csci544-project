since its creation in 1958 , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has owned and operated a small fleet of aircraft to provide passenger transportation .
to assess reasonableness of costs , use , and agency oversight and management of the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) passenger aircraft services , we met with officials of nasa's office of infrastructure and administration aircraft management office and appropriate officials at the johnson space center , houston , texas ; marshall space flight center , huntsville , alabama ; kennedy space center , cape canaveral , florida ; wallops flight facility , wallops island , virginia ; and dryden flight research center , edwards , california .
subtitle f. we also reviewed nasa's implementing publications , nasa policy directive ( npd ) 7900.4b , nasa aircraft operations management ( april 2004 ) ; nasa policy regulation ( npr ) 7900.3a , aircraft operations management ( april 1999 ) ; and center - specific implementing instructions .
in this regard , you requested that our audit address ( 1 ) the relative cost of nasa passenger aircraft services compared with commercial coach costs , ( 2 ) whether nasa's retention and operation of aircraft for passenger transportation was in accordance with applicable governmentwide guidance , and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of nasa's oversight and management of its passenger aircraft services .
a - 11 , preparation , submission and execution of the budget part 7: planning , budgeting , acquisition and management of capital assets ( revised june 2005 ) ; general services administration's ( gsa ) federal property management regulations , 41 c.f.r .
we also identified and assessed ( 1 ) nasa's implementing policies and procedures with respect to omb and gsa policy guidance , ( 2 ) the process used to approve and document passenger aircraft utilization , ( 3 ) associated aircraft management reports , ( 4 ) other recent assessments and studies done with respect to nasa passenger aircraft services , and ( 5 ) the extent to which accurate , current agencywide data were available to agency managers for day - to - day decision making on passenger aircraft usage and costs .
congress should consider whether legislation is necessary to ensure that ( 1 ) nasa disposes of all of its passenger aircraft not used in accordance with omb's explicit policy prohibition against owning aircraft to support travel to routine site visits , meetings , speeches , and conferences ; and ( 2 ) funding for future nasa passenger aircraft purchases and operations is restricted to those necessary to meet mission requirements consistent with omb guidance .
immediate actions to dispose of all aircraft not needed to address mission requirements and adoption of more flexible , less costly alternatives to satisfy future mission requirements would best position nasa to meet its stewardship responsibilities for taxpayer funds it receives , and better enable it to meet its current fiscal challenges .
these aircraft are in addition to approximately 80 aircraft that nasa reported using in its research and development and program support operations .
nasa also contracted with charter carriers or had interagency agreements with other federal agencies to obtain additional passenger air transportation services .
