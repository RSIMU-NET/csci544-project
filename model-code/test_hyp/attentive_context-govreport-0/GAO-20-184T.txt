federal obligations under sba's 8 ( a ) business development program totaled about $10.9 billion in fiscal year 2019 .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our prior work on weaknesses in the small business administration's ( sba ) oversight and monitoring of alaska native corporations ( anc ) subsidiary firms ( “anc - owned firms” ) that participate in the agency's 8 ( a ) program and the actions sba has taken to address these weaknesses .
my testimony today will discuss ( 1 ) highlights of the aforementioned reports related to tribal firms , including anc - owned firms , participating in the 8 ( a ) program , and ( 2 ) the extent to which sba has addressed the recommendations we made in those reports .
from 2006 through 2016 , gao issued three reports detailing the limitations of sba's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 ( a ) program .
the 8 ( a ) program is one of the federal government's primary vehicles for developing socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses , including those firms owned by ancs .
our subsequent reports in 2012 and 2016 also found various limitations in sba's oversight , including limitations in sba's ability to share key data across its district offices and long - standing staffing challenges specific to its alaska district office , which oversaw the majority of anc - owned firms in the 8 ( a ) program .
more recent reports issued by the sba office of inspector general demonstrate that sba continues to face challenges in its oversight of the 8 ( a ) program , in general .
from 2006 through 2016 , we issued three reports detailing the limitations of sba's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 ( a ) program .
implementing our remaining recommendations could help sba address its monitoring and oversight control weaknesses in a comprehensive manner .
all six recommendations are important to enhancing sba's oversight of anc - owned firms in the 8 ( a ) program .
one of the key benefits of this program is the ability for anc - owned firms to receive federal contract awards noncompetitively for any dollar amount .
we have not evaluated the operational effectiveness of sba's actions to implement the 15 recommendations , but if effectively implemented , those actions should help sba improve its oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms in the 8 ( a ) program .
however , to date sba has not provided us with evidence that it has implemented the three following recommendations , which if implemented as intended , could significantly improve its oversight of the 8 ( a ) program .
specifically , we found that sba had ( 1 ) incomplete information and documentation on anc - owned firms' compliance with regulatory requirements ; ( 2 ) limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce revenue rules of tribal firms , including anc - owned firms ; ( 3 ) insufficient staffing in its alaska district office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks of anc - owned firms ; and ( 4 ) inadequate program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations .
