as agreed , the report ( 1 ) identified how many minority - owned or controlled and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes have applied for and received allocations and how much they have applied for and received from 2005 through 2008 ; ( 2 ) explained the nmtc application process and summarized nmtc application scores for minority and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes by cde type from 2005 through 2008 ; ( 3 ) described the challenges minority - owned or controlled and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes have faced in applying for and receiving nmtc allocations ; and ( 4 ) identified efforts the cdfi fund and others are taking to assist minority - owned or controlled cdes in applying for nmtc allocations .
congress created the nmtc through the community renewal tax relief act of 2000 to encourage investors to make investments in low - income communities that traditionally lack access to capital .
potential changes that could be considered include , but would not be limited to the following: ( 1 ) similar to provisions for certain federal grant programs , requiring that a certain portion of the overall amount of allocation authority be designated for minority cdes ; ( 2 ) in accordance with information we obtained in discussions with several experts in economic development , exploring the potential for creating a pool of nmtc allocation authority to be dedicated specifically for community banks ( minority banks that are certified cdes , in most cases , would likely compete with non - minority community banks with similar characteristics for nmtc allocations ) ; or ( 3 ) similar to other federal programs where preferences are given to targeted populations , offering priority points to minority cdes that apply for nmtc allocations .
in addition , implementing these changes would require addressing a number of issues , including legal and administrative concerns , associated with such changes in the nmtc application process .
conventional access to credit and investment capital for developing small businesses , retaining jobs , and revitalizing neighborhoods is often limited in economically distressed communities or in communities with large low - income populations .
our prior mandated work on the nmtc has focused on the implementation of the program , the effect of the credit on the behavior of individual and corporate investors , and efforts by the cdfi fund and internal revenue service ( irs ) to ensure that cdes and investors are in compliance with nmtc program requirements .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss minority community development entities' ( cde ) participation in the new markets tax credit ( nmtc ) program .
the community development financial institutions ( cdfi ) fund in the department of the treasury administers the nmtc program and allocates tax credit authority — the amount of investment for which investors can claim a tax credit — to cdes that apply for and obtain allocations .
cdes are domestic partnerships or corporations with a primary purpose of serving or providing investment capital to low - income communities or low - income persons .
although these options could increase the amount of nmtc authority awarded to minority cdes , in part because we could not definitively identify the reasons why minority cdes have scored lower on the nmtc application than non - minority cdes , the options may not address the underlying reasons for lower minority cde success .
