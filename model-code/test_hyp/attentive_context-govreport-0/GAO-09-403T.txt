mda has been charged with developing and fielding the ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) , a system expected to be capable of defending the united states , deployed troops , friends , and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight .
in march 2009 , we plan to issue our report covering mda's progress toward achieving its goals during fiscal year 2008 as well as its efforts to improve transparency , accountability , and oversight .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the future of the missile defense agency's ( mda's ) testing program .
the national defense authorization acts for fiscal years 2002 , 2007 and 2008 mandated that we prepare annual assessments of mda's ongoing cost , schedule , testing , and performance progress .
our recommendations include actions to improve cost reporting as well as testing and evaluation .
in fulfilling this charge , mda placed an initial set of missile defense components in the field in december 2005 .
additionally , in september 2008 , we issued a report on mda's target program .
dod is in the process of preparing a formal response to the report and its recommendations .
mda has indicated that this new approach to testing will take time to implement , with partial implementation in fiscal year 2010 and full implementation not occurring until fiscal year 2011 .
problems with the reliability and availability of targets ( which are themselves ballistic missiles ) have increasingly affected bmds development and testing since 2006 .
in particular , the ambitious fiscal year 2009 flight test plan may need to be reassessed with the goal of establishing a robust series of tests that can withstand some delays without causing wholesale changes to the test plan during the transition .
our work included examining documents such as program execution reviews , test plans and reports , and production plans .
in addition to linking the critical modeling and simulation variables with test events , the review will have to address the factors that have limited the productivity of the current test approach , such as the availability and performance of targets .
mda continues to experience difficulties achieving its goals for testing .
mda has indicated that its revision will result in a more robust test plan , providing more margin to conduct the tests through , for example , having spare interceptors and targets available .
in the mean time , mda will have to be prudent in making decisions to produce and field additional assets .
the overall performance of the bmds cannot yet be assessed because mda lacks a fully accredited end - to - end model and simulation capability and , according to the bmds operational test agency , it will not have that capability until 2011 at the earliest .
mda intends to complete all three phases of the review by may 2009 .
during fiscal year 2008 , while several tests showed progress in individual elements and some system level capabilities , all bmds elements experienced test delays or shortfalls .
in that report , we are recommending additional steps to further improve the transparency , accountability , and oversight of the missile defense program .
