specifically , i will ( 1 ) identify workforce challenges that va medical facilities experience related to va crnas , and ( 2 ) identify a key mechanism that va medical facilities have to help make va crna salaries competitive for recruitment and retention purposes and the extent to which va facilities use this mechanism .
given the increased demand for crnas and the important role they play in providing anesthesia services in va medical facilities , concerns have been raised about the challenges va may face in making va crna salaries competitive in order to maintain its va crna workforce , particularly in some local markets where the labor market for crnas can be highly competitive .
one such issue va faces is an increased demand for the services provided by certified registered nurse anesthetists ( crna ) , who provide the majority of anesthesia care veterans receive in medical facilities operated by va. crnas are registered nurses who have completed a 2- to 3-year master's degree program in nurse anesthesia and who typically provide anesthesia care in health care settings with anesthesiologists and surgeons .
there are approximately 500 va - employed crnas ( va crna ) who provide anesthesia care to veterans in va medical facilities .
in december 2007 we issued a report that examined the challenges va faces recruiting and retaining va crnas .
to do the work for our december 2007 report , we analyzed web - based surveys we sent to all va chief anesthesiologists , va human resources ( hr ) officers , and va crnas , with survey response rates of 92 , 85 , and 76 percent , respectively .
while the demand for crnas has continued to increase , many va crnas are nearing retirement eligibility age .
according to va officials , more than half of va crnas are over the age of 51 , and the average va crna is 7 years closer to retirement eligibility than the average crna nationally .
to improve va's ability to recruit and retain va crnas , we recommended that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the assistant secretary for human resources and administration to expedite development and implementation of a training course on va's lps policy for va medical facility officials responsible for compliance with the policy .
we also interviewed a representative from kaiser permanente , a large health care plan that primarily uses crnas to deliver anesthesia services , to identify what steps this plan takes to ensure it has a sufficient number of crnas and to determine the indicators this plan uses to identify a crna shortage or potential future crna shortage .
the demand for these practitioners in va medical facilities has continued to increase because crnas are no longer used only in the operating room , but are used in other areas of a medical facility , such as administering anesthesia to patients who are undergoing cardiac catheterization and providing airway management to patients during cardiac emergencies .
in december 2007 we also reported that va's locality pay system ( lps ) is a key mechanism that va medical facilities can use to determine whether to adjust va crna salaries to help the facilities remain competitive with crna salaries in local market areas .
