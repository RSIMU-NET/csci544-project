the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , accelerated the deployment of advanced imaging technology ( ait ) systems , commonly referred to as full - body scanners , in response to the december 25 , 2009 , attempted terrorist attack on northwest airlines flight 253 .
to help ensure that tsa invests in screening technology that meets mission needs , the administrator of the transportation security administration should ensure that the following two actions are taken before procuring ait - 2 systems: measure system effectiveness based on the performance of the ait - 2 technology and screening officers who operate the technology , while taking into account current processes and deployment strategies , and use scientific evidence and information from dhs's science and technology directorate , and the national laboratories , as well as information and data provided by vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements , estimated time , and resources needed to achieve tsa's tier iv end state .
tsa would have more assurance that its $3.5 billion investment in ait provides effective security benefits by ( 1 ) measuring system effectiveness based on the performance of the ait - 2 technology and sos who operate the technology , while taking into account current processes and deployment strategies and ( 2 ) using scientific evidence and information from dhs's science and technology directorate , and the national laboratories , as well as information and data provided by vendors , to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements , estimated time , and resources needed to achieve tsa's tier iv end state .
to mitigate those concerns , tsa began installing automated target recognition ( atr ) software on deployed ait systems in july 2011 .
according to tsa officials , ait systems provide enhanced security benefits compared with those of walk - through metal detectors by identifying nonmetallic threat objects and liquids .

as an update to our prior work , you asked us to evaluate tsa's efforts to enhance effectiveness of ait systems .
to help ensure that tsa improves so performance on ait - atr systems and uses resources effectively , the administrator of the transportation security administration should take the following two actions: clarify which office is responsible for overseeing tsa's ied screening checkpoint drills operational directive , direct the office to ensure enforcement of the directive in conducting these drills , and analyze the data to identify any potential weaknesses in the screening process , and establish protocols that facilitate the capturing of operational data on secondary screening of passengers at the checkpoint to determine the extent to which ait - atr system false alarm rates affect operational costs once ait - atr systems are networked together .
in january 2012 , we concluded that tsa had acquired advanced imaging technology ( ait ) systems that were not being used on a regular basis and thus were not providing a security benefit .
