 ( recommendation 1 ) .
in these written comments , fcc stated that it agreed with our recommendation and noted steps it plans to take to assess the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of making off - premises broadband access eligible for e - rate program support .
according to the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) , part of the department of commerce , the internet has taken on an increasingly prominent role in schools , and students who lack access are at risk of missing opportunities to advance their education .
our objectives for this report were to examine: ( 1 ) challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework that involves internet access and ( 2 ) what selected school districts are doing to expand wireless internet access for their students , and the federal role in such efforts .
we are making the following recommendation to fcc: the chairman of the federal communications commission should determine and execute a methodology for collecting and analyzing data — such as conducting a new pilot program regarding off - premises wireless access or analyzing other data — to assess the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of making off - premises wireless access eligible for e - rate program support , and publish the results of this analysis .
determining the best way to collect and analyze data on the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of making off - premises wireless access eligible for e - rate program support ; conducting such analysis ; and publishing the results could provide relevant information and transparency to external stakeholders .
while school districts have made efforts to address the homework gap , such efforts may be inhibited by existing restrictions in fcc's e - rate program .
to examine challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework that involves internet access , we analyzed data on internet access and use from the census bureau's november 2017 current population survey ( cps ) : computer and internet use supplement , sponsored by ntia .
we also interviewed officials with fcc and education to determine and review federal efforts related to school initiatives to expand wireless access for students .
the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 included a provision for us to review wireless internet for low - income school - age children .
doing so could also enable fcc to make a determination on whether it would be appropriate to ease restrictions on off - premises access , a step that may give school districts more flexibility in addressing the homework gap .
internet access is crucial for communication , economic activity , and education , including for students at the elementary and secondary school levels .
we reviewed documentation from fcc and education regarding relevant federal efforts , including rulemaking documents and documents about fcc's schools and libraries universal service support mechanism ( also known as the e - rate program ) , which provides schools with discounts on telecommunications and internet services .
this report examines: challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework that involves internet access , and what selected school districts are doing to expand wireless internet access for their students , and the federal role in such efforts .
