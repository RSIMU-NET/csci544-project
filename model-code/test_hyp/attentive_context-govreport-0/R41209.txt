on march 31 , 2010 , the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) in the office of management and budget ( omb ) issued a proposed policy letter on inherently governmental functions and other "work reserved for performance by federal government employees. .
while not final , the policy letter represents the obama administration's proposed guidance for agencies determining ( 1 ) whether particular functions are inherently governmental and ( 2 ) when functions closely associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions and critical functions should be performed by government personnel .
the proposed policy letter was , in part , issued under the authority of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fy2009 ( ndaa'09 ) and president obama's memorandum of march 4 , 2009 , on government contracting .
section 321 of ndaa'09 tasked omb with ( 1 ) reviewing existing definitions of "inherently governmental function" to determine whether such definitions are "sufficiently focused" to ensure that only government personnel perform inherently governmental functions or "other critical functions necessary for the mission of a federal department or agency ; " ( 2 ) developing a "single consistent definition" of "inherently governmental function" that would address any deficiencies in the existing definitions , reasonably apply to all agencies , and ensure that agency personnel can identify positions that perform inherently governmental functions ; ( 3 ) developing criteria for identifying "critical functions" that should be performed by government personnel ; and ( 4 ) developing criteria for identifying positions that government personnel should perform in order to ensure that agencies develop and maintain "sufficient organic expertise and technical capacity" to perform their missions and oversee contractors' work .
depending upon their views regarding the desirability and potential efficacy of the provisions of the final policy letter , members of the 112 th congress could hold hearings or introduce legislation like that enacted or introduced in the 111 th congress ( e.g. , p.l .
the office of federal procurement policy has reportedly indicated that a final policy letter will be released "in early 2011. .
president obama's march 4 , 2009 , memorandum similarly charged omb with clarifying when outsourcing is "appropriate. .
key among these issues are ( 1 ) the relationship between the proposed policy letter and other executive branch authorities on inherently governmental and related functions ; ( 2 ) whether the proposed policy letter would necessarily result in changes in agencies' use of contractors to perform certain functions that some members of congress and commentators claim are inherently governmental ( e.g. , security services during contingency operations ) ; and ( 3 ) the potential demands of any new requirements upon the acquisition workforce .
four definitions of "inherently governmental function" currently exist in law , with one additional definition in a government - wide policy document that lacks the force of law .
however , agencies generally have considerable discretion in determining whether particular functions are inherently governmental , and some members of congress and commentators have alleged that certain functions that have been contracted out should have been classified as inherently governmental ( e.g. , provision of personal security ) .
