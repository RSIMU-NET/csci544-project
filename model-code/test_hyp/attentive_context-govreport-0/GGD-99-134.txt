this report responds to your requests for a review of the procurement practices of the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance authority ( authority ) .
as you are aware , the authority was established by congress in 1995 to repair the district's failing financial conditions and to improve the effectiveness of its various entities .
to accomplish this , the authority was given a wide range of statutory authority and responsibility , including awarding contracts itself and the review and approval of contracts awarded by the district , to ensure the most efficient and effective service delivery .
the other two contracts were awarded by the district's chief procurement officer ( cpo ) and totaled over $1 million .
based on concerns regarding allegations of procurement improprieties at the authority , you requested that we determine whether applicable procurement regulations and procedures were followed in awarding and administering selected contracts on behalf of the authority's former chief management officer ( cmo ) and to thompson , cobb , bazilio and associates , a private accounting firm that is responsible for auditing the authority's financial statements .
ten of the contracts were awarded by the authority and totaled $13 million .
although we reviewed a total of 10 contracts that were awarded by the authority , we only assessed whether 9 of them were awarded and administered in accordance with the authority's procurement regulations because 1 of the contracts in our review , thompson , cobb , bazilio and associates ( contract number fy96 / fra#2 ) was awarded before the authority's regulations were adopted in march 1996 .
they do not fully address findings that the authority did not fully define the roles and responsibilities of its procurement staff or provide guidance to its staff on how to ( 1 ) determine best value ; ( 2 ) develop performance standards for work statements ; ( 3 ) monitor contractors' performance and certify satisfactory performance ; ( 4 ) document its basis for contractor selection and justification for sole source awards ; and ( 5 ) provide its contracting staff with guidance for awarding and administering those procurement actions not specifically covered by its regulations , such as contracts between $100,000 and $500,000 , and for executing contract modifications , or contract options .
we reviewed a total of 12 contracts and their associated contract actions , which we selected based on your specific concerns .
the authority did not provide us with any information on what procedures were followed in awarding this contract. .
as requested , we also determined whether the authority and the district received the goods and services that they contracted and paid for in the contracts that we reviewed .
second , the authority had not provided its contracting staff with guidance on how to implement its procurement regulations to ensure compliance .
for example , dsic reviewed over 100 authority contracts that totaled $47.2 million and were awarded between august 1995 and september 1998 .
dsic attributes the authority's contracting problems , in part , to the authority's emphasis on achieving its programmatic mission in a short time period and its lack of procurement expertise .
while the authority's regulations do not require independent cost estimates for all of its contracts , the regulations do authorize the authority to develop its own cost / price estimate to help assess the reasonableness of contractor proposals .
