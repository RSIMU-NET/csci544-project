an antitrust suit ( originally a class action ) was filed by a group of ipo purchasers against the underwriters of those issues ( 10 major investment banks ) alleging conspiracy , price fixing - related , and tying violations of § 1 of the sherman act .
the particular , allegedly harmful practices included ( 1 ) required investor promises to place bids in the aftermarket at prices above the initial public offering price , referred to as "laddering" ; ( 2 ) required investor commitments to purchase other , less attractive securities , a kind of tying arrangement ; and ( 3 ) investor payment of excessive commissions .
given ( 1 ) congress's expressed concern that securities markets become and remain stable , ( 2 ) the continued oversight and actions of a single expert regulatory agency versus the probability of diverse and possibly conflicting decisions by nonexpert judges in the event of securities / antitrust lawsuits , and ( 3 ) the likelihood of conflict between the mandates of antitrust law and allowable activities under the securities laws , the court found that "the securities laws are 'clearly incompatible' with the application of the antitrust laws. .
the securities and exchange commission has traditionally recognized certain types of manipulative activities , considered "stabilizing" activities , as permissible under § 9 ( a ) ( 6 ) of the securities exchange act and sec rule 10b - 1 .
further , the sec has , and has exercised , its specific authority to supervise those activities .
credit suisse gave the court the opportunity — not exercised since 1981 — to reiterate and apply its previously stated standards for granting implied antitrust immunity .
at first glance , this system of agreement by the issuer and all of the major underwriters of size and pricing of the offering does appear , in fact , to be antitrust - violative price manipulation .
in fact , the court itself indicated that the complaint was an attack not on the existence of the sec - approved joint ipo activity , but rather , the abuse of that activity .
a "little price manipulation" has been permitted in order to further appropriate market goals .
the court , in an opinion authored by justice breyer , began its analysis of the availability of implied antitrust immunity in this instance by noting that all of the challenged activities meet the basic prerequisite for implied antitrust immunity in the regulated securities industry: they are "central to the proper functioning of well - regulated capital markets. .
in my view , agreements among underwriters on how best to market ipos , including agreements on price and other terms of sale to initial investors , should be treated as procompetitive joint ventures for purposes of antitrust analysis .
these requirements , according to the investors , artificially inflated the share prices of the securities and constituted per se price fixing .
however , not all underwriter manipulations have been prohibited .
he noted that both the securities act of 1933 and the securities and exchange act of 1934 state , in "savings clauses," that their remedies "shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity": therefore , both statutes explicitly save the very remedies the court holds to be impliedly precluded .
