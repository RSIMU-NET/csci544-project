congress included a provision in the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 requiring us to report on the recent employment of former department of defense ( dod ) officials by major defense contractors .
each year , civilian and military personnel leave the department of defense ( dod ) and go to work for contractors that do business with dod â€” sometimes the same contractors they were working with before leaving dod .
in response , this report ( 1 ) provides information on how many former dod military and civilian personnel worked for major defense contractors in 2006 and an estimate of how many of these were former dod senior or acquisition officials who worked on defense contracts for these employers that were the responsibility of their former agency or their direct responsibility at dod and ( 2 ) identifies the practices used to monitor compliance with post - government employment restrictions and the information challenges that contractors and dod face in monitoring the movement of former dod employees to defense contractors .
several of our reports on these past strategies to make post - dod employment with defense contractors more transparent to dod , the most recent in 1990 , found problems with the implementation and enforcement of those reporting requirements , and questioned the extent to which former dod officials or defense contractors complied with them and the effectiveness of dod's monitoring .
for example , dod could consider requiring defense contractors who are awarded a contract , within a set number of days after contract award , to ( 1 ) disclose to the contracting officer the names of employees who are certain former dod officials ( e.g. , civilian senior executives , high - level military officers , or acquisition officials ) who worked on the response to the solicitation and ( 2 ) certify that these employees are in compliance with the applicable post - government employment restrictions .
congress included a provision in the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 requiring us to report on recent employment of former dod officials by major defense contractors .
officials who serve in senior or acquisition positions and then leave dod for jobs with defense contractors are subject to laws restricting their new employment activities .
beginning as early as 1969 , efforts to maintain public trust and monitor compliance with post - government employment restrictions have included laws requiring certain former dod officials to self - report their employment with defense contractors for up to 2 years after leaving dod and requiring contractors to report annually on the employment of these former officials to various dod ethics offices .
more recently , our work and the work of others have raised concerns that the monitoring of former dod officials' compliance with post - government employment restrictions may be inadequate .
in response , our report objectives were to ( 1 ) develop information on how many former dod military and civilian personnel recently worked for major defense contractors and develop an estimate of how many of these were former dod senior or acquisition officials who worked on defense contracts for these employers that were related to their former positions at dod and ( 2 ) identify the practices used to monitor compliance with post - government employment restrictions and the information challenges that contractors and dod face in monitoring the movement of former dod employees to defense contractors .
