in this report , we ( 1 ) determine whether the continued development of the cmp has been consistent with leading industry practices , ( 2 ) examine what factors contributed to the changes in the cost estimate from 2002 to 2005 and determine whether the cost estimate was updated using industry practices , ( 3 ) review the status of financing of the planned renovation , ( 4 ) identify decisions needed for the renovation to continue as planned , and ( 5 ) review the un's efforts to oversee and the u.s. department of state's ( state ) efforts to monitor the planned renovation .
the united nations ( un ) headquarters complex in new york city neither conforms to current safety , fire , and building codes nor meets un technology or security requirements .
to address these concerns , the un has developed the capital master plan ( cmp ) â€” a comprehensive renovation of the entire complex .
permanent representative to the united nations work with other member states to ensure that the secretariat identifies a procurement strategy for the cmp to mitigate the impact of weaknesses in un procurement processes and ensure that oios receives sufficient funding for its oversight of the cmp .
in june 2006 , we testified that effective implementation of the cmp is vulnerable due to weaknesses in existing un oversight and procurement practices .
in addition , oios will need sufficient funds to oversee compliance with un financial rules and regulations , as applied to the cmp project .
as the un's host country and largest contributor , the united states continues to have a significant interest in the success of the renovation .
in november 2006 , the cmp office updated the cost estimate to $1.88 billion .
oios has been conducting oversight of the cmp office since 2003 and has not found any material weaknesses in its work .
we also recommended that the secretary of state encourage the un to provide its internal and external oversight offices with the resources needed to conduct effective oversight .
for example , we found that the un has yet to incorporate guidance for construction procurement into its procurement manual .
to determine whether the continued development of the un's renovation project was consistent with leading industry practices , we reviewed un records , including reports and designs developed by the architect - engineering firms .
in june 2001 and may 2003 , we reported that un renovation planning efforts had been reasonable and conformed to leading industry practices .
oios relies on funds from the cmp budget to conduct effective oversight of the cmp , which may impair its ability to secure sufficient funds .
we previously reported that oios's reliance on extrabudgetary funds and limitations on how oios may spend its funds constrains its ability to conduct effective oversight .
however , the extent to which oios must negotiate with the un office of program planning , budget , and accounts ( oppba ) for future funding could affect oios's ability to conduct effective oversight of the cmp .
we have previously reviewed un efforts to develop the cmp and prepare a cost estimate .
oios also agreed with our conclusions and recommendations and noted that oios's current resources do not allow it to provide adequate audit coverage .
