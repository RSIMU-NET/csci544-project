specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the number , status , and reasons for park service visitor center projects ; whether these projects involved new construction or renovation of existing facilities ; and whether these projects were identified as priorities by the park service or by the congress ; ( 2 ) the costs of the visitor center projects and the functions included in those projects ; and ( 3 ) the sources of funding for the projects .
most of the park service's 384 parks have a visitor center , but as existing visitor center buildings age and new parks are added to the system , new or renovated visitor centers are needed .
the variation in the costs , size , and functions of projects that include visitor centers supports the park service's efforts .
the national park service manages and maintains thousands of facilities to provide nearly 300 million visitors a year a safe and enjoyable visit to the nation's parks and monuments .
one of the most important of these facilities is the visitor center , which serves as a focal point for visitors to learn about a park and offers a variety of services , including such basic services as orientation and information , exhibits and interpretation , publication sales , and restrooms .
road construction funds from the federal highway administration's federal lands highway program provide an estimated $35 million , or 6 percent , of the total project funding .
concerned that some of the new visitor center projects included new services , such as transportation facilities , and also appeared more costly than the projects that were built in the past , you asked us to provide detailed information , such as costs and functions , on park service visitor center projects that have been built or that are being planned to be built .
conserving the nation's natural and cultural resources and ensuring visitor enjoyment of these resources has been the primary mission of the national park service since its inception in 1916 .
of the 80 visitor center projects , 16 have been completed and 15 are still under construction .
this expansion , combined with budget tightening of the 1980s and early 1990s , resulted in few visitor centers being built over the last 20 years .
the park service has long provided facilities for visitor use , but over time , the way that the park service has provided services has changed .
the park service has completed or started over one - third of the 80 visitor center projects , and the remaining two - thirds are being planned and construction is expected to be completed in the next 4 years .
the remaining 49 visitor center projects , which were being planned as of april 2001 , are expected to be completed by fiscal year 2005 .
our study included all national park service visitor center projects that had either been completed , were under construction , or were planned to be completed between fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 2005 ( as identified by january 2001 ) .
some of the existing visitor centers occupy buildings that were constructed in the early part of the century and were adapted to provide visitor services .
