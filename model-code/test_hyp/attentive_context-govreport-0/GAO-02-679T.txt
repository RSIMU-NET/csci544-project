since 1988 , the medicaid program has offered transitional medicaid assistance , which provides certain families who are losing medicaid as a result of employment or increased income up to 1 year of additional medicaid health insurance coverage .
transitional medicaid assistance was originally enacted for a 10-year period , and has twice been extended to help provide continued health insurance coverage to families moving into employment .
the enactment of federal welfare reform in august 1996 significantly changed federal welfare policy for low - income families with children in several ways , including establishing a 5-year lifetime limit on cash assistance .
states have implemented a variety of initiatives intended to help families move from cash assistance to the workforce , including some enhancements to transitional medicaid .
the welfare reform law also extended transitional medicaid assistance through 2001 , thus continuing an important link to health insurance coverage for individuals as their economic circumstances changed .
because the transitional medicaid provision is due to expire in september 2002 and you are considering its extension , you asked us to provide information on the role this program plays in supporting transitions from welfare to work .
accordingly , my remarks today will focus on how transitional medicaid assistance provides low - income working families an option to maintain health insurance coverage and states have used transitional medicaid to provide health insurance coverage to families .
employment in low - wage or part - time positions — which is common for these newly working individuals — frequently does not provide adequate access to affordable health insurance , whether through employer - sponsored or individually purchased health insurance , thus making transitional medicaid coverage an important option .
these initiatives have likely contributed to a drop in cash assistance caseloads of more than 50 percent from 1996 through mid - 2001 .
for example , some states reported increasing training for state eligibility determination workers to better inform beneficiaries of this entitlement and how to access it .
our earlier work showed that , for the 21 states we reviewed , the implementation of transitional medicaid assistance varied across the states and that certain state practices had enhanced beneficiaries' ability to retain medicaid coverage .
amending the medicaid statute to provide states with additional flexibility to ease income - reporting requirements for the coverage period of transitional medicaid assistance , as has been done for other aspects of the medicaid program , could further facilitate uninterrupted health insurance coverage for families moving from cash assistance to the workforce .
i am pleased to be here today as you consider the role of medicaid in helping families' transition from welfare to the workforce .
in summary , transitional medicaid assistance is a key protection offered to families at a critical juncture in their efforts to move from welfare to work .
my comments are based largely on our previously issued reports and testimony on medicaid and welfare reform .
we also found , however , that many families did not receive their full transitional medicaid assistance benefits because they failed to report their income three times , as required , throughout the 12-month period of coverage .
while such approaches helped make transitional medicaid more available , beneficiaries' failure to report income as required often resulted in their losing eligibility after the first 6 months .
