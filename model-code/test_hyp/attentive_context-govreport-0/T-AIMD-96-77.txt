the single audit is an important means by which the congress , federal oversight officials , and program managers obtain information on whether the recipients of federal assistance properly account for the federal funds they receive , maintain adequate internal controls over those funds , and comply with program requirements .
the single audit , which has gained widespread acceptance throughout the country , has helped foster fundamental financial management improvements and strengthened accountability at state and local governments and nonprofit organizations receiving federal assistance .
the 12 years of experience with the single audit act have shown that refinements can be made to strengthen the usefulness of single audits while at the same time reducing the burden on state and local governments and nonprofit organizations .
today , i would like to provide some perspective on the importance of the single audit act , highlight the results of our most recent assessment of the act's implementation which recommended ways to improve the single audit process , and address the specific amendments that are now being considered .
the proposed amendments , which we strongly support , address these refinements .
this has resulted in the state and local governments institutionalizing fundamental reforms , such as ( 1 ) preparing annual financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles , ( 2 ) obtaining annual independent comprehensive audits , ( 3 ) strengthening internal controls over federal funds and compliance with laws and regulations , ( 4 ) installing new accounting systems or enhancing old ones , ( 5 ) implementing subrecipient monitoring systems that have greatly improved oversight of entities to whom they have distributed federal funds , ( 6 ) improving systems for tracking federal funds , and ( 7 ) resolving audit findings .
during the 1970s , the poor accounting practices of state and local governments put into question the security of federal funds provided to those governments .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss proposed amendments to the single audit act of 1984 .
the audits usually did not address financial controls and were , therefore , unlikely to find systemic problems with an entity's management of its funds .
moreover , particularly in the case of block grants — where the federal financial role diminishes and management and outcomes of federal assistance programs depend heavily on the overall state or local government controls — the single audit process provides accountability by focusing the auditor on the controls affecting the integrated federal and state funding streams .
second , entities now have 13 months from the end of the fiscal year to submit their single audit reports to the federal government .
the 1975 new york city financial crisis focused increased attention on this problem .
these audits focused on whether the transactions of specific grants complied with their program requirements .
the assistance grew from 132 programs costing $7 billion in 1960 to over 500 programs costing nearly $95 billion by 1981 .
before passage of the act , the federal government relied on audits of individual grants to help gain assurance that state and local governments and nonprofit organizations were properly spending federal assistance .
it was found that new york city consistently overestimated its revenues , underestimated its expenses , never knew how much cash it had on hand , and borrowed repeatedly to finance its deficit spending .
