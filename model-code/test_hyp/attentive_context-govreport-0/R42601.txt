the people's republic of china ( prc ) has the world's largest number of internet users , estimated at 500 million people , including an estimated 300 million people with accounts on twitter - like microblogging sites .
the development of the internet and its use in china have raised u.s. congressional concerns , including those related to human rights , trade and investment , and cybersecurity .
along with its extensive internal security apparatus , china also has an aggressive and multi - faceted internet censorship system .
despite government efforts to limit the flow of information , chinese internet users are able to access unprecedented amounts of information , and the web has served as a lifeline for political dissidents , social activists , and civil society actors .
these include the use of the internet as a u.s. policy tool for promoting freedom of expression and other rights in china ; the use of the internet by political dissidents in the prc and the political repression that such use often provokes ; and the role of u.s. internet companies in both spreading freedom in china and cooperating with prc censorship and social control efforts .
congressional interest in the internet in china is linked to human rights in a number of ways .
"netizens" have helped to curb some abuses of government authority and compelled some officials to conduct affairs more openly .
the web also has enabled the public to engage in civil discourse on a national level .
since the early 2000s , policy makers have focused on supporting censorship circumvention techniques and their use in china , protecting the privacy of chinese internet users , and discouraging or preventing u.s. information and communications technology companies from aiding beijing's censorship efforts and public surveillance system .
however , the internet has proven to be less of a catalyst for democratic change in china than many foreign observers had initially expected or hoped .
they have advocated a broader approach or the development of a more comprehensive and robust mix of tools and education for "cyber dissidents" and online activists in china and elsewhere , including the following: software and training to help dissidents and civil society actors communicate securely through evading surveillance , detecting spyware , and guarding against cyberattacks ; archiving and disseminating information that censors have removed from the internet ; developing means of maintaining internet access when the government has shut it down entirely ; and providing training in online communication , organization , and advocacy .
u.s. efforts to promote internet freedom have broadened .
some government departments have begun to solicit online public input on policy issues .
according to some analysts , counter - censorship technology has proven to have a vital , but limited , impact on the promotion of freedom and democracy in the prc .
in 2011 , freedom house ranked china as one of the five countries with the lowest levels of internet and "new media" freedom .
in addition to the effectiveness of censorship , some studies show that the vast majority of internet users in china do not engage the medium for political purposes .
furthermore , some experts argue that the internet in china has created an illusion of democracy by allowing people to vent their opinions online and by providing venues for debate on some political and policy issues .
