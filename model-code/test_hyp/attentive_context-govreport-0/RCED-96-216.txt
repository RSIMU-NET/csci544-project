the department of energy ( doe ) is responsible for managing the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile , including surveillance of weapons currently in the stockpile to identify reliability and safety problems .
doe conducts three types of stockpile surveillance tests — flight tests , nonnuclear systems laboratory tests , and nuclear and nonnuclear component tests — on nine types of nuclear weapons .
our objectives in this review were to ( 1 ) provide information on the status of doe's stockpile surveillance program ; ( 2 ) if the program is not on schedule , determine why it is not ; and ( 3 ) provide information on the steps being taken to return the program to the schedule .
furthermore , without contingency plans , doe's ability to respond to possible future major disruptions in its testing operations is uncertain .
your offices asked us to provide information on the status of the stockpile surveillance program .
we recommend that the secretary of energy direct that the assistant secretary for defense programs develop detailed , written plans to restore stockpile surveillance tests to the contingency plans for testing facilities to provide for continued testing operations in the event that a testing facility is shut down for an extended period of time .
if the program is not on schedule , you asked us to determine why it is not and provide you with information on the steps being taken to get the program back on schedule .
about 1 in 3 actionable findings ( 118 findings ) have resulted in retrofits and major design changes .
as a result , the stockpile surveillance program's role in assessing weapons' reliability and ensuring confidence in the reliability takes on increased importance .
however , without formal written plans detailing how doe will increase the number of surveillance tests in order to return the program to its schedule , it is difficult to determine if doe's estimates on getting the surveillance testing back on schedule are reasonable and cost - effective .
the purpose of doe's stockpile surveillance program is to ensure , primarily through three types of tests , that the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons are maintained .
in addition , doe officials stressed that reliability of the nuclear weapons in the stockpile have not been adversely affected by a lack of testing .
when a weapon's reliability is lowered because of a finding , the result is reported to the department of defense ( dod ) .
doe's confidence in the reliability levels assigned to some nuclear weapons has been diminished because some needed tests have not been carried out .
furthermore , we believe that issues and factors such as the availability of test missile launches , expiration of approved safety studies , or cessation of operations at test facilities could have an adverse effect on doe's future ability to remain on schedule .
to ensure nuclear weapons' reliability , it is important that doe's stockpile surveillance be maintained on schedule .
air force officials confirmed that providing for future intercontinental ballistic missile flight tests may be difficult because of limitations imposed by the start treaties .
however , without formal documents detailing testing plans , costs , and schedules , it is difficult — if not impossible — to review the plans and assess their adequacy , determine the cost - effectiveness of the plans , or measure progress the test facilities are making .
