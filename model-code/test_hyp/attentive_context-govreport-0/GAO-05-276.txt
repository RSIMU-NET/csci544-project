the president's budget for fiscal year 2005 identified approximately $60 billion for information technology ( it ) projects .
this report responds to your request that we describe and assess omb's processes for ( 1 ) placing projects on its management watch list and ( 2 ) following up on corrective actions established for projects on the list .
the officials added that the fiscal year 2005 budget process required agencies to successfully correct project weaknesses and business case deficiencies ; otherwise , omb would limit agencies' spending on new starts and other developmental activities .
in that budget , the office of management and budget ( omb ) stated that , of approximately 1,200 major it projects , about half — 621 projects , representing about $22 billion — were on a ‘‘management watch list.'' this information was reiterated in testimony in march 2004 , during which omb officials stated that the list consisted of mission - critical projects that needed to improve performance measures , project management , and it security .
omb identified weaknesses in these three areas , among others , in its analysis of the business cases that agencies submitted to justify project funding .
to accomplish these objectives , we reviewed and analyzed omb's policy and budget guidance for fiscal year 2005 and interviewed omb officials ( further details on our objectives , scope , and methodology are provided following the background section ) .
in helping to formulate the president's spending plans , omb is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of agency programs , policies , and procedures ; assessing competing funding demands among agencies ; and setting funding priorities .
our objectives were to describe and assess omb's processes for ( 1 ) placing projects on its management watch list and ( 2 ) following up on corrective actions established for projects on the list .
report to the congress on progress made in addressing risks of major it investments and management areas needing attention .
we agree that our review described and assessed omb's processes for ( 1 ) placing the 621 projects representing about $22 billion on its management watch list and ( 2 ) following up on corrective actions established for projects on the list .
the president's budget for fiscal year 2006 includes 1,087 it projects , totaling about $65 billion .
this undermined its ability to assess governmentwide trends and issues .
in addition , major projects with significant management deficiencies may have continued to absorb critical agency resources .
among other things , the exhibit 300 requires agencies to provide information summarizing spending and funding plans ; performance goals and measures ; project management plans , goals , and progress ; and security plans and progress .
omb also is to ensure that agency reports , rules , testimony , and proposed legislation are consistent with the president's budget and with administration policies .
according to omb , its predominant mission is to assist the president in overseeing the preparation of the federal budget and to supervise budget administration in executive branch agencies .
analyze the prioritized list to develop governmentwide and agency assessments of the progress and risks of it investments , identifying opportunities for continued improvement .
