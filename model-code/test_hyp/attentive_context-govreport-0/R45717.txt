to do this , the report first examines historical trends in federal spending and revenue policy to illustrate both the challenges and trade - offs inherent to making choices between ( 1 ) limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods , ( 2 ) reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income , ( 3 ) reducing support for state and local governments , and ( 4 ) raising taxes .
the growth of the national debt , which is considered unsustainable under current policies , continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking .
this report examines alternative approaches to reducing annual budget deficits and decisions about how to bring the national debt under control over the long term .
using projections of the debt and deficit , the report then addresses how limiting reliance on one source of deficit reduction creates pressure on other sources .
therefore , to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run , it is likely that ( 1 ) transfer payments , such as social security , medicare , and medicaid , to or on behalf of individuals ( which already account for half of federal spending and are growing ) must be reduced ; ( 2 ) transfers to state and local governments must be reduced ( which would shift the budget decisions to a different level of government ) ; ( 3 ) taxes must be raised ; or some combination of the three .
the federal government incurs a budget deficit when total spending exceeds revenues over the course of a fiscal year .
over the past 50 years , the federal government has , on average , run budget deficits of 2.9% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , though as seen in figure 1 , the amount has fluctuated from a surplus of 2.3% of gdp in 2000 to a deficit of 9.8% of gdp in 2009 .
for example , if the debt is 80% of gdp and the economy is growing at 1.6% , a deficit of 1.28% of gdp ( 1.6% of 80% ) will maintain the debt - to - gdp ratio .
policy choices , such as the decline in defense spending after the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 , may change the budget situation due to changes in national priorities .
of concern is that the federal budget deficit has resulted in the growth of the federal debt that has regularly exceeded the growth rate of the economy .
for example , deficits tend to rise during recessions ( through a combination of decreased revenues and increased spending on programs like unemployment ) , whereas the opposite is generally true during economic expansions .
the accumulation of net deficits over time results in the federal debt .
outside of the 9% provision for domestic goods , defense spending for goods and services constitutes about 15% of federal spending .
reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level ; thus , limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending , including entitlement programs such as social security , medicare , and medicaid .
