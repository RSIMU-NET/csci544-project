the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , under the authority of congress as enunciated in periodic farm legislation , provides support to the u.s. farm economy through a variety of federal farm programs .
direct support can often involve the transfer of billions of dollars each year .
for example , usda's commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) outlays on farm support programs have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017 .
this variation has generated considerable interest — by both the general public and congress — in who is eligible to participate in farm programs and , thus , may receive payments .
program eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how many u.s. farm programs operate and how support dollars are distributed across the nation .
program payments vary across commodities and regions as well as by size of farm operations .
the concern over program eligibility also derives , in part , from instances where farm payments have accrued to individuals who have never engaged in farming .
a key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be "actively engaged in farming" ( aef ) — that is , that a person contribute either labor or management time ( or both ) to the farm's operation .
a number of statutory and regulatory requirements govern federal farm program eligibility for benefits under various programs .
in particular , eligibility requirements and payment limits determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive .
gao has undertaken several studies of program eligibility and of usda efforts to monitor and enforce program payment limits .
as a consequence of such criticism , the definition of aef has evolved over the years as congress and usda — via its regulatory powers — have attempted to tighten payment eligibility criteria .
the 2014 farm bill ( §1604 ( b ) ( 3 ) ) instructed usda to consider the extent to which new regulations would "adversely impact" the long - term viability of the farming operation .
the initial attempt to restrict payments to actual farmers was in 1987 , when congress enacted what is commonly known as the farm program payments integrity act ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 , p.l .
not all farm programs are subject to the same aef criteria , and the criteria often apply differently based on the type of legal entity owning the farm operation .
the current regulatory definition of a significant contribution of active personal management has been in effect for over 20 years ; congress has not mandated a more restrictive definition during that time , including in the 2008 farm bill .
such consideration should take into account: the size , nature , and management requirements of a farming operation ; the changing nature of active personal management due to advancements of farming operations ; and the degree to which these new regulations will adversely impact the long - term viability of the farming operation .
aef criteria are a required component of eligibility for payments under the principal revenue support programs of the 2018 farm bill , including the agriculture risk coverage ( arc ) and price loss coverage ( plc ) programs and benefits under the marketing assistance loan ( mal ) program .
