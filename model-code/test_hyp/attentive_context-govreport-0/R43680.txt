as a result , the federal debt held by the public increased from 39% of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2008 to 72% of gdp in 2013 , which was its highest share of gdp since after world war ii .
the congressional research service ( crs ) does not take a position on the best way to reduce the deficit .
the federal budget has been in deficit ( i.e. , spending has exceeded revenues ) since 2002 , and deficits were significantly larger from 2009 to 2012 than in any other year since world war ii .
congress has expressed interest in examining policy options to reduce the deficit .
at some point , spending cuts or revenue increases will be needed to restore fiscal sustainability , although the recent decline in the deficit has provided policymakers more flexibility on the timing of these changes .
the fiscal outlook has improved significantly since then , although the budget is projected to remain in deficit under current policy .
this report first discusses the size of projected budget deficits , then discusses how much the deficit would need to be reduced to return to long - term sustainability , then analyzes alternative time frames for reducing the deficit , and finally discusses broad policy choices for reducing the deficit .
in the past , persistent deficits have proven sustainable because periods of moderate growth in the debt relative to gdp have been followed by periods when debt fell relative to gdp ( typically , because the debt grew more slowly than gdp ) .
from 1946 to 2008 , budget deficits averaged 1.7% of gdp and exceeded 5% of gdp only three times ( equaling 7.2% in 1946 , 6.0% in 1983 , and 5.1% of gdp in 1985 ) .
in 2014 , the baseline deficit is projected to be $492 billion or 2.8% of gdp .
this increase is projected to be gradual â€” the debt does not increase relative to gdp until 2019 , is five percentage points higher by 2024 , and reaches 100% of gdp by 2036 or sooner .
current policy is unsustainable because projected deficits are large enough to cause the federal debt to continuously grow faster than national income .
despite the improvement , the deficit still remains above its historical average .
the budget deficit was 10.1% of gdp in 2009 , falling to 7% of gdp in 2012 .
not since the end of world war ii has the deficit fallen so much , so quickly .

this report organizes and presents information to help policymakers frame the debate .
medicare's sustainable growth rate ( sgr ) system is intended to constrain medicare payments to physicians .
all legislative changes that increase ( decrease ) the deficit also increase ( decrease ) net interest payments on the debt in future years .
the budget deficit increased by almost $1 trillion between 2008 and 2009 .
