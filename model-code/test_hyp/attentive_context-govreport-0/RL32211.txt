the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , as approved and implemented bycongress , entered into force on january 1 , 1994 .
 ( 78 ) since mexico is not currently a party to the wto agp , its procurement obligations with the unitedstates are governed solely by nafta .
in addition to the wto and nafta , many of the other free trade agreements ( ftas ) thatthe united states has in effect contain provisions with respect to government procurement .
procurement obligations between the united states andcanada had been , prior to nafta , contained in the u.s. - canada free trade agreement , whose$25,000 threshold for federal goods contracts has been carried forward into the naftaagreement .
 ( 77 ) chapter 10 of nafta contains extensive procurementobligations , which generally follow and build upon provisions contained in the 1979 gattprocurement code .
 ( 79 ) in addition to exceptions in individual schedules , nafta procurement obligations , likethose of the agp , are subject to national security and general exceptions .
 ( 83 ) moreover , our most recent ftas such as the u.s. - - chile fta,u.s. - - singapore fta , u.s. - - morocco fta and the u.s. - - australia fta ( 84 ) each contain procurementprovisions that closely track those provided for by the agp .
 ( 101 ) as amended by the uruguay round agreements act , the taaalso authorizes the president to waive the prohibition on procurement of products from a non - partycountry or instrumentality where the country has: ( 1 ) agreed to apply transparent and competitiveprocedures to its government procurement equivalent to those in the agreement and ( 2 ) maintainsand enforces effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with itsgovernment procurement .
 ( 103 ) at this time , however , no statutory changes have been madeto implement the procurement chapters of the u.s. ftas with jordan , chile or singapore .
for example , the u.s. - - israel fta contains provisions for the waiver of any buy national provisionsfor contracts with a value greater than $50,000 .
 ( 102 ) specific amendments to the taa have been made through the years to implementprocurement obligations contained in u.s. ftas .
furthermore , the dominicanrepublic - central american free trade agreement ( dr - cafta ) also contains provisions relatingto government procurement that are similar to those contained in the u.s. - morocco andu.s. - australia ftas ( i.e. , without a national security exception ) , however , while implementinglegislation has been enacted for dr - cafta , the agreement has not yet taken effect .
 ( 97 ) specifically , the statute permits the president to: the president may designate a foreign country for purposes of the taa only if he determinesthat the country or instrumentality: is a party to one of the wto agreement on government procurement or thenafta and will provide appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunitiesto u.s. products and suppliers of such products ; is a country or instrumentality , other than a major industrial country , which willotherwise assume wto procurement obligations and will provide such opportunities to suchproducts and suppliers ; is a country or instrumentality , other than a major industrial country , which willprovide such opportunities to such products and suppliers ; or is a least developed country .
