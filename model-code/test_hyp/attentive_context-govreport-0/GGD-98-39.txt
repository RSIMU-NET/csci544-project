as part of its mission , the internal revenue service ( irs ) strives to maintain the highest possible level of tax compliance .
this report responds to your request for information on the ( 1 ) number of igps nationwide and in irs' georgia district during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , ( 2 ) descriptions and results of igps in the state of georgia during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , and ( 3 ) controls and procedures irs has in place for igps .
irs annually audits a number of tax returns to determine whether taxpayers have voluntarily complied with the tax laws and paid the proper amounts of tax .
information gathering projects ( igp ) are one technique that irs uses to collect information on noncompliance and to identify returns with audit potential .
in selecting returns for audit , irs' computer assigns a score to each filed return to help find those having audit potential â€” that is , those for which an audit would be likely to change the reported tax because of noncompliance .
due to your concerns about igps being misused in auditing tax returns , you asked us to study irs' use of igps in identifying returns for audit .
because such computer - aided selection techniques rely solely on information on filed returns , irs' examination division collects information from other sources to identify areas of potential taxpayer noncompliance .
our past work has discussed some of the problems with attempts to research noncompliance and related solutions through igps.for example , we raised concerns about whether igps ( 1 ) focused on taxpayer populations with significant compliance shortfalls and ( 2 ) collected statistically valid data that could be generalized to a larger population .
we focused on fiscal years 1994-1996 because accurate and verifiable data for prior years were unavailable .
over half of these igps ( 44 ) focused on four types of taxpayers: ( 1 ) businesses that potentially underreported income or overreported expense deductions ; ( 2 ) businesses that potentially did not properly report or pay taxes , such as excise taxes on fuel , chemicals , or heavy vehicle use ; ( 3 ) individual taxpayers who potentially claimed an improper exemption for dependents , a filing status ( e.g. , head of household ) , or earned income credit ; and ( 4 ) businesses and individual taxpayers who potentially did not file required tax returns .
the length of time that these 41 igps had remained open varied from 5 months to several years ; more specifically , 23 of the 41 igps lasted 2 or more years .
the revised framework also includes irs' recent efforts to develop a more comprehensive and statistically valid approach to compliance research .
these controls and procedures are designed to guard against any improprieties and misuse of igps , as well as to better ensure productive use of audit resources .
the additional recommended tax plus penalty amounts per igp ranged from $0 ( in the 9 igps closed without any audits ) to $269 million ; of the 32 igps with audits , 11 recommended total additional tax amounts that exceeded $500,000 , and 7 recommended total amounts exceeding $1 million .
