in this regard , the department requested about $38 billion for its information technology ( it ) investments for fiscal year 2012 , including about $25 billion in combined investments at the departments of the air force , army , and navy ( don ) .
the department of defense ( dod ) spends billions of dollars each year to maintain operational systems and processes intended to support its mission .
for decades , dod has been challenged in modernizing its systems environment to reduce duplication and increase integration between its systems .
further , dod's enterprise architecture approach relies on each level of its organization ( e.g. , dod - wide , military departments , and programs ) to develop a meaningful architecture .
because dod is provided with over $30 billion each year for its it systems environment , the potential for identifying and avoiding the costs associated with duplicative functionality across its it investments is significant .
effective use of a well - defined enterprise architecture is a basic tenet of successful systems modernization and associated organizational transformation efforts , such as the one dod has long been seeking to accomplish .
while dod has been provided with considerable resources for its it systems environment , the department is not managing its systems in a consistent , repeatable , and effective manner that , among other things , maximizes mission performance while minimizing or eliminating system overlap and duplication .
accordingly , the development and use of a military department enterprise architecture is critical for organizational transformation and systems modernization across dod and within each military department .
in the event that a military department does not intend to fully satisfy all elements of our framework , the plan should include a rationale for why the department deems any such element ( s ) to be not applicable .
as we have previously reported , without a well - defined enterprise architecture , it is unlikely that dod , including its component organizations , will be able to transform business processes and modernize supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability .
dod has been provided with over $30 billion annually for its it systems environment , but it is not managing its systems in a consistent , repeatable , and effective manner that , among other things , maximizes mission performance while minimizing or eliminating system overlap and duplication .
according to dod's systems inventory , the department's it environment is composed of 2,324 systems and includes 338 financial management , 719 human resource management , 664 logistics , 250 real property and installation , and 300 weapon acquisition management systems .
dod also provided technical comments on this report , which have been incorporated as appropriate .
further , because the military departments do not have the robust enterprise architectures that dod's federated architecture approach depends on , the department at large is also without a complete road map to effectively guide its transformation .
establishing such a road map is critical to dod transformation .
further , the military departments have been limited in their ability to overcome long - standing enterprise architecture management challenges , thus indicating a lack of organizational commitment to effective enterprise architecture development and use .
