in addition to this funding , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) administration for children and families ( acf ) monitors states' compliance with key federal goals , specified in part by the adoption and safe families act ( asfa ) of 1997 , to keep children safe and ensure their placement in stable and permanent homes .
since 1994 , designated federal matching funds have been available to states to develop and implement comprehensive case management systems — statewide automated child welfare information systems ( sacwis ) — to manage their child welfare cases as well as to report child abuse and neglect , foster care , and adoption information to the federal government .
my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) states' use of title iv - b funds in providing a wide array of services to prevent the occurrence of abuse , neglect , and foster care placements , as well as other child welfare services ; ( 2 ) factors that hinder states' ability to protect children from abuse and neglect ; and ( 3 ) hhs's role in helping states to overcome the challenges they face in protecting children from abuse and neglect .
title iv - b of the social security act , comprised of two subparts , is the primary source of federal funding for services to help families address problems that lead to child abuse and neglect and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families .
funding under title iv - e of the social security act is used primarily to pay for the room and board of children in foster care .
as you are aware , state child welfare agencies determined that over 900,000 children had been the victims of abuse or neglect by their parents or other caretakers in 2001 .
through its formal review process , known as the child and family services review ( cfsr ) , hhs uses specific assessment measures , such as agencies' ability to conduct timely abuse and neglect investigations and regularly visit children in their homes , to assess the performance of states' child welfare systems .
additionally , more than 800,000 children are estimated to spend some time in foster care each year , with the federal government allocating approximately $7 billion each year to investigate abuse and neglect , provide placements to children outside their homes , and deliver services to help keep families together .
washington , d.c.: july 31 , 2003 ; and child welfare: enhanced federal oversight of title iv - b could provide states additional information to improve services .
those findings were based on multiple methodologies , including a survey of child welfare directors on states' use of title iv - b funds ; an analysis of 600 exit interview documents completed by staff who severed their employment from 17 state , 40 county , and 19 private child welfare agencies ; and a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia regarding their experiences in developing and using information systems and their ability to report data to hhs .
although hhs plays a role in monitoring child welfare programs , additional oversight or technical assistance could assist states in meeting the needs of children served by child welfare agencies .
