carbon capture and sequestration ( or storage ) — known as ccs — is a physical process that involves capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) at its source and storing it before its release to the atmosphere .
an integrated ccs system would include three main steps: ( 1 ) capturing co 2 at its source and separating it from other gases ; ( 2 ) purifying , compressing , and transporting the captured co 2 to the sequestration site ; and ( 3 ) injecting the co 2 into subsurface geological reservoirs .
congress has appropriated nearly $7 billion in total since fy2008 for ccs research , development , and demonstration ( rd&d ) at doe's office of fossil energy: nearly $3.5 billion in total annual appropriations ( including fy2015 ) and $3.4 billion from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l .
the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) has pursued research and development of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated ccs system since 1997 .
u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) proposed rules and guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new and existing coal - fired power plants have been a focal point of discussion in congress about ccs .
 ( in part , the roadmap was intended to lay out a path for rapid technological development of ccs so that the united states could continue to use fossil fuels despite potential carbon restrictions. ) .
legislation regarding ccs in the last congress mainly focused on two issues: stopping or slowing implementation of the epa ghg rules and guidelines and providing federal incentives to accelerate the demonstration and development of ccs at commercial scales .
the recovery act funding also was likely intended to help doe achieve its rd&d goals as outlined in the department's 2010 rd&d ccs roadmap .
the large and rapid influx of funding for industrial - scale ccs projects from the recovery act was intended to accelerate development and demonstration of ccs in the united states .
futuregen had experienced delays and multiple changes of scope and design since its inception in 2003 , and on february 3 , 2015 , doe announced that it was suspending the project .
ccs could reduce the amount of co 2 emitted to the atmosphere from the continued use of fossil fuels at power plants and other large , industrial facilities .
although doe has pursued aspects of ccs rd&d since 1997 , the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .
111-5 ; enacted february 17 , 2009 , hereinafter referred to as the recovery act ) .
the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa , p.l .
110-140 ) amended the energy policy act of 2005 to include , among other provisions , authorization for seven large - scale ccs demonstration projects ( in addition to futuregen ) that would integrate the carbon capture , transportation , and sequestration steps .
however , the future deployment of ccs may take a different course if the major components of the doe program follow a path similar to doe's futuregen project .
this report aims to provide a snapshot of the doe ccs program , including its current funding levels , together with some discussion of the program's achievements and prospects for success in meeting its stated goals .
