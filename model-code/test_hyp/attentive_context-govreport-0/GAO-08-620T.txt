based on your request , our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess how the president's budget request for irs for fy 2009 allocates resources for enforcement , service , research , and systems modernization primarily compared to fy 2008 enacted levels ; ( 2 ) assess the rationales for differences between the 2 years , including the rationales for initiatives and the extent to which those rationales have been justified ; ( 3 ) determine the status of irs's efforts to develop and implement its bsm program ; and ( 4 ) determine the total cost of administering the economic stimulus program .
the president has requested $11.4 billion in program dollars to fund irs's fy 2009 operations , including $11.1 billion for service to taxpayers and tax law enforcement , plus $223 million for the business systems modernization ( bsm ) program , irs's ongoing effort to improve the agency's business and tax processing systems .
financing of the federal government depends largely on irs's ability to effectively administer the tax laws .
we appreciate this opportunity to comment on the president's fiscal year ( fy ) 2009 budget request for the internal revenue service ( irs ) .
for the first report , we compared enacted and requested budgets for irs ; reviewed documents , including estimates of revenues and costs from initiatives ; and interviewed irs officials .
passage of this act required irs to act quickly to deal with taxpayers' questions and begin issuing payments .
one complicating factor for carrying out irs's ambitious plans in the immediate future is the recent passage of the economic stimulus act of 2008 , which creates additional , unanticipated workload for irs this year .
the budget request and strategies aim to build on recent irs accomplishments such as annually bringing in more revenue through enforcement and making progress on modernizing irs's business and tax processing systems .
the fy 2009 budget request is a road map for how irs intends to allocate resources in order to carry out ambitious plans of improving enforcement , improving taxpayer service , increasing research , and continuing to invest in modernized information systems .
future releases of the customer account data engine ( cade ) and account management services ( ams ) continue to face risks and challenges , which irs is working to mitigate .
to meet these objectives , we drew upon and updated a recently issued report on the budget request and irs's 2008 tax filing season , and for our bsm work , we relied primarily on our review of the fy 2008 bsm expenditure plan .
together with the budget request , irs's recently published strategies spell out its intentions for improving taxpayer service and reducing the net tax gap â€” the difference between the taxes owed and eventually paid , most recently estimated at $290 billion for tax year 2001 .
irs has also taken steps to address our prior recommendations ; however , work remains to fully implement them , including developing long - term plans for completing the bsm program .
of particular note , irs included return on investment ( roi ) information for all nonlegislative initiatives .
in assessing the cost of the economic stimulus package , we obtained performance and production data , looking for factors that significantly affected performance , and we interviewed irs officials .
