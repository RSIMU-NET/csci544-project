this draft testimony is being provided to obtain advance review and comment from those with responsibility for the subjects it discusses .
collectively , the reports show that long - standing performance and management challenges hinder the federal government's efforts to achieve results .
making these improvements will require the sustained efforts of the leadership and staff within agencies .
at the same time , the report series also underscored the pivotal role that the federal government's central management agencies — in particular , omb — must play in guiding and overseeing agencies' efforts to address the shortcomings that we identified and to implement the changes necessary to improve performance .
as you know , last month we issued a major new series of reports , entitled performance and accountability series: major management challenges and program risks , and an update of our high risk series .
the report series also highlighted numerous improvements that agencies need to make in their performance , management , and accountability .
mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee: we are pleased to be here today to discuss our observations on the office of management and budget's ( omb ) efforts to carry out its responsibilities to set policy and oversee the management of the executive branch .
many management policies require budgetary resources for their effective implementation , whether it is financial management reform or information systems investment .
first , we will provide an outline of omb's wide - ranging management responsibilities and note that the question of whether to integrate or separate management and budget functions has been long debated .
like most organizations , federal agencies increasingly depend on information technology ( it ) to improve their performance and meet mission goals .
framework contains as its core elements financial management improvement legislation , including the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 , the government management reform act of 1994 , and the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 ; information technology reforms , including the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) of 1995 and the clinger - cohen act of 1996 ; and the government performance and results act of 1993 ( the results act ) .
second , we will discuss the effectiveness of omb's management leadership , which , in our view , has been uneven .
in our 1995 review of omb 2000 , we recommended that omb review the impact of its reorganization as part of its planned broader assessment of its role in formulating and implementing management policies for the government .
considerable effort is now being exerted several agencies have made good progress towards achieving financial management reform goals .
congress has , in effect , served as the institutional champion for many of these initiatives , providing a consistent focus for oversight and reinforcement of important policies .
for example , congress' — and in particular this subcommittee's — attention to the year 2000 problem , information management , and financial management , has served to elevate these problems on the administration's management agenda .
this year's plan follows a structure similar to that developed last year , including ( 1 ) a discussion of the administration's high impact agencies initiative , which focuses on defining service delivery commitments , developing customer and employee satisfaction measures , using interagency partnerships , and enhancing electronic access ; and ( 2 ) 24 specific priority management objectives ( pmo ) , many of which are also on gao's high risk list .
