the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) constellation program is approaching a crossroads in development as it nears entry into the implementation phase .
the program has delayed its entry into implementation , however , and is still modifying its overall architecture and specific requirements .
the constellation program is developing the ares i crew launch vehicle and the orion crew exploration vehicle , the agency's first major efforts to support implementation of the vision for space exploration .
over $10 billion has already been obligated and nasa budget estimates indicate that over $97 billion is to be spent on the constellation program through 2020 .
nasa initiated the constellation program in november 2005 and expected the program to enter implementation in 2009 .
to assess nasa's progress toward establishing a sound business case for the ares i and orion projects and identify key technical challenges nasa faces in developing the ares i crew launch and the orion crew exploration vehicles , we obtained and analyzed constellation plans and schedules , risk mitigation information , and contract performance data relative to the standards in our knowledge - based acquisition practices including program and project plans , contracts , schedules , risk assessments , funding profile , budget documentation , earned value reports , and the results of nasa's assessments of the program .
meanwhile , the new administration is conducting an independent review of nasa's human spaceflight activities , with the potential for recommendations of broad changes to the agency's approach toward future efforts .
the constellation program tracks technical challenges in its integrated risk management application ( irma ) .
as nasa addresses the findings and recommendations of the review of u.s. human space flight plans committee , we recommend that the new nasa administrator direct the constellation program , or its successor , to develop a sound business case — supported by firm requirements , mature technologies , a preliminary design , a realistic cost estimate , and sufficient funding and time — before proceeding into implementation , and , if necessary , delay the preliminary design review until a sound business case demonstrating the program's readiness to move forward into implementation is in hand .
the constellation program's poorly phased funding plan has affected the program's ability to deal with technical challenges .
constellation program officials and contractor cost reports indicate that the new effort has increased the value of the constellation program's developmental contracts from $7.2 billion in 2007 to $10.2 billion in june 2009 .
our previous work on best practices and nasa's own acquisition policies indicate that the program's architecture and requirements should be finalized and system designs expected to meet requirements in hand before a program enters the implementation phase .
the committee plans to complete this review by august 2009 and include any changes to current plans in an amended submission to its fiscal year 2010 budget request .
in may 2009 , the obama administration announced an independent review of u.s. human space flight plans and activities with the stated goal of ensuring that the nation is pursuing the best course for the future of human space flight .
since then , nasa has taken steps to decrease risk , including delaying the first crewed flight from september 2014 to march 2015 and deferring work on lunar requirements .
