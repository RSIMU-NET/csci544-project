our objectives for this engagement were to ( 1 ) characterize the cio ratings for selected federal agencies' it investments as reported on the dashboard over time , ( 2 ) determine the extent to which selected agencies' cio ratings are consistent with reported investment risk , and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which selected agencies are addressing at - risk investments .
the dashboard is to provide transparency for these investments in order to facilitate public monitoring of government operations and accountability for investment performance by the federal chief information officers ( cio ) who oversee them .
in accordance with its responsibilities set forth in law , the office of management and budget ( omb ) launched the federal information technology ( it ) dashboard in june 2009 as a public web site that reports performance and supporting data for major it investments — on which the federal government plans to invest over $38 billion in fiscal year 2014 .
our objectives for this engagement were to ( 1 ) characterize the chief information officer ( cio ) ratings for selected federal agencies' information technology ( it ) investments as reported on the dashboard over time , ( 2 ) determine the extent to which selected agencies' cio ratings are consistent with reported investment risk , and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which selected agencies are addressing at - risk investments .
these investments became the focus of joint omb - agency techstat accountability sessions ( techstats ) — evidence - based reviews intended to improve investment performance through concrete actions .
the eight agencies are the departments of agriculture ( agriculture ) , commerce ( commerce ) , energy ( energy ) , justice ( justice ) , transportation ( transportation ) , the treasury ( treasury ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) , and the social security administration ( ssa ) .
secondly , omb stated that it began using the it dashboard to help identify at - risk investments starting with its launch in june 2009 , rather than 2010 .
to address our first objective , we selected the eight agencies with the most reported major it spending in fiscal year 2012 , after excluding agencies reviewed in our most recent report on the dashboard.reviewed publicly available data from the dashboard from its inception in june 2009 through august 2013 .
according to omb , it began using the dashboard to identify at - risk investments with its launch in june 2009 .
omb neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation ; agriculture agreed with the report's findings ; commerce disagreed with our recommendation ; energy concurred with our recommendation with one exception related to supercomputers ; justice , treasury , and transportation neither agreed nor disagreed with the report's findings ; va agreed with the report's findings ; and ssa agreed with our recommendation .
we support omb in its efforts to increase public transparency and accountability .
omb believes that the existing guidance is appropriate and does not have plans to review it .
while we acknowledge that omb and federal agencies continue to have access to the dashboard during the budget process , the public display of these data is intended to allow other oversight bodies , including congress and the general public , to hold government agencies accountable for progress and results .
