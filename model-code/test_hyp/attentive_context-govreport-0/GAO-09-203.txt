our specific objectives were to assess ( 1 ) the status of the commission's actions to correct or mitigate previously reported information security weaknesses and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of its controls for ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of its financial information systems and information .
the objectives of our review were ( 1 ) to determine the status of the securities and exchange commission's ( sec ) actions to correct or mitigate previously reported information security weaknesses and ( 2 ) to determine whether controls over key financial systems were effective in ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of financial and sensitive information .
to support its demanding financial and mission - related responsibilities , the commission relies extensively on computerized systems .
in order to protect financial and sensitive information — including personnel and regulatory information maintained by sec — from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , fraudulent use , improper disclosure or manipulation , or destruction , it is essential that sec have effective information security controls in place .
as part of our audit of sec's fiscal year 2008 financial statements , we assessed the effectiveness of the commission's information security controls over key financial systems , data , and networks .
as you are aware , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) is responsible for enforcing securities laws , issuing rules and regulations that provide protection for investors , and helping to ensure that the securities markets are fair and honest .
in our report on sec's financial statements for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 , we concluded that weaknesses in information security controls constitute a significant deficiency in internal controls over the information systems and data used for financial reporting .
until sec ( 1 ) mitigates known information security weaknesses in access controls and other information system controls and ( 2 ) fully implements a comprehensive agencywide information security program that includes filling the security officer position , adequately reporting risks , conducting effective system security tests , and certifying and accrediting an intermediary subsystem , its financial information will remain at increased risk of unauthorized disclosure , modification , or destruction , and its management decisions may be based on unreliable or inaccurate information .
in a separate report with limited distribution , we are also making 32 recommendations to enhance sec's access controls and configuration management practices .
sec has made important progress in implementing its information security program .
however , information security weaknesses — both old and new — continue to impair the agency's ability to ensure the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of financial and sensitive information .
in this report , we provide additional details on sec's information security controls .
sec has made progress in correcting or mitigating previously reported weaknesses .
while sec has made important progress in strengthening its information security controls , it has not completed actions to correct or mitigate 16 of the previously reported weaknesses .
to determine the status of sec's actions to correct or mitigate previously reported information security weaknesses , we identified and reviewed its information security policies , procedures , practices , and guidance .
we are sending copies of this report to the chairmen and ranking members of the senate committee on banking , housing , and urban affairs ; the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs ; the house committee on financial services ; and the house committee on oversight and government reform .
