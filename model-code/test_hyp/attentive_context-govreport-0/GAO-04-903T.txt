my testimony today will summarize and update , where possible , key findings from our 2002 report related to ( 1 ) trends in crime against volunteers and the agency's system for generating such information , ( 2 ) the agency's field implementation of its safety and security framework , and ( 3 ) the underlying factors that contributed to peace corps' performance in the field .
the administration intends to increase this number to about 14,000 over the next few years , and congress has increased appropriations for the peace corps to support this expansion .
i am pleased to be here to discuss peace corps' efforts to ensure the safety and security of its volunteers .
about 7,500 peace corps volunteers currently serve in 70 “posts” ( country missions ) around the world .
volunteers often live in areas with limited access to reliable communications , police , or medical services .
my testimony is based on our july 2002 report , information we obtained from the peace corps to update our analysis , and recent testimony before the house of representatives .
i will also discuss actions that peace corps has taken to improve the safety and security of its volunteers since we issued our report .
in many countries , female volunteers face special challenges ; more than a third of female volunteers report experiencing sexual harassment on at least a monthly basis .
the agency is still clarifying its guidance on how to apply its revised framework , revising its indicators of progress , and establishing a base line for judging performance in all areas of safety and security .
to improve safety and security practices in the field , in 2002 , the agency increased the number of field - based safety and security officers charged with reviewing post practices and assisting them in making improvements , and created a safety and security position at each post .
however , peace corps is still in the process of implementing many of these actions and their full effect has yet to be demonstrated .
to develop our analysis , we analyzed peace corps' crime data ; reviewed agencywide safety and security policies , guidelines , training materials , volunteer satisfaction surveys , and inspector general reports ; interviewed key staff and more than 150 volunteers ; and examined practices for selecting volunteer sites , developing emergency action plans , and performing other tasks .
we reported that a number of factors , including staff turnover , informal supervision and oversight mechanisms , and unclear guidance hampered peace corps' efforts to ensure high - quality performance for the agency as a whole .
in conclusion , since we issued our report in july 2002 , it is clear that the agency has taken a number of steps designed to improve the safety and security of its volunteers .
we also recommended that peace corps develop performance indicators and report on its safety and security initiatives .
recent tests of the emergency action plans indicate that the agency has made improvements in the length of time needed to contact volunteers .
the analyst has focused on upgrading the crime data system and shifting the responsibility for data collection and analysis from the medical office to the newly created safety and security office , to place the responsibility for crime data in an office dedicated to safety and security .
