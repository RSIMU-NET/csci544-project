the department of energy ( doe ) contracts with private companies and educational institutions to manage and operate 18 of its 22 laboratories .
these are cost reimbursement contracts under which doe pays all of its contractors' allowable costs .
responding to criticism that its historical contracting practices were costly and inefficient , doe switched to performance - based contracts in 1994 as part of its contract reform program .
concerned about the progress made to implement performance - based contracting at the national laboratories , you asked us to assess the status of performance - based contracting in doe's national laboratory contracts , and identify efforts being made to determine the impact of performance - based contracting .
an important feature of performance - based contracting is providing incentives , including fees , to the contractor's achievement of objectives as a means of encouraging superior performance and lowering costs .
use of these contracts allows doe to structure each contract to provide a clear statement of what needs to be accomplished — rather than providing broad statements of work — and to rely on performance measures to evaluate a contractor's progress toward meeting its objectives .
doe can also provide a fee , or profit , to a contractor for managing a laboratory .
the report noted that the use of incentives has been effective in directing contractors' attention to performance outcomes and has improved communications concerning performance expectations .
doe did not implement our recommendation and has no plans to measure the overall costs and benefits of performance - based contracting for its laboratories .
although doe has not assessed the impact of performance - based contracting , limited reviews have found both progress and problems , as these examples show: since 1997 , doe's office of inspector general has issued three reports on problems the department had in implementing performance - based incentives at three facilities ( one of which was a laboratory ) .
we noted that although doe maintained that its performance - based incentives have been effective in achieving the desired end results , it had not been clear whether these successes were due to performance - based incentives or to an increased emphasis on program management .
the need for this type of evaluation is consistent with the principles of the government performance and results act of 1993 that require agencies to measure outcomes against their goals .
doe relies on field units to negotiate its contracts , including whether to use performance - based fees , and how performance objectives and measures will be accomplished .
because doe does not know whether performance - based contracting is improving performance at lower cost at its national laboratories and because our previous recommendation to develop criteria for measuring the costs and benefits of paying fees to contractors for incurring increased financial risk was not implemented , we recommend that the secretary of energy evaluate the costs and benefits from using performance - based contracting at the national laboratories .
as a result , early attempts led to large numbers of performance measures .
doe's laboratories were not the focus of this review , however .
doe is responsible for ensuring that the laboratory system — with 22 laboratories in 14 states , a combined budget of over $10 billion a year , and a staff of about 60,000 — is managed in an effective , efficient , and economical manner .
