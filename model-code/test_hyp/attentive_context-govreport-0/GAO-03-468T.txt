specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) how the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks affected the financial markets and the actions market participants and infrastructure providers took to restore trading ; ( 2 ) the steps taken by 15 stock exchanges , electronic communication networks ( ecn ) , clearing organizations , and payment systems providers to address physical and electronic security and business continuity planning since the attacks ; and ( 3 ) the steps financial regulators have taken to ensure that the markets are better prepared for future disasters .
in addition , the effectiveness of the securities and exchange commission's ( sec ) technology and operations risk oversight efforts — which clearly have increased in importance — have been limited by program , staff , and resource limitations .
today , i will present the findings from our report potential terrorist attacks: additional actions needed to better prepare critical financial market participants , gao - 03-414 ( washington , d.c.: feb. 12 , 2003 ) .
the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks severely disrupted the u.s. financial markets because of the loss of life , damage to buildings , loss of telecommunications and power , and restrictions that were placed on access to the affected area .
i appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss gao's work on how key financial market participants and the financial regulators are working to improve the resiliency of their operations and the financial markets in the event of future terrorist attacks .
our report made recommendations designed to better prepare the markets to deal with future disasters and to enhance sec's technology and operations risk oversight capabilities .
although the financial regulators have begun efforts to improve the resiliency of clearance and settlement functions within the financial markets , they have not fully developed goals , strategies , or sound practices to similarly improve the resiliency of trading functions .
our review of 15 stock exchanges , ecns , clearing organizations , and payments system providers between february and june 2002 showed that all were taking steps to implement physical and electronic security measures and had developed business continuity plans .
however , organizations still had limitations in one or more areas that increased the risk of disruptions to their operations if such disasters occurred in the future .
if certain organizations had sustained serious damage , the markets would probably not have been able to reopen by september 17 , 2001 .
however , financial market participants were able to recover relatively quickly from the terrorist attacks , as a result of market participants' and infrastructure providers' heroic efforts and because the securities exchanges and clearing organizations largely escaped direct damage .
market participants and regulators have acknowledged that the attacks revealed limitations in their business continuity capabilities and that these limitations would need to be addressed to improve their ability to recover if such events occurred in the future .
some of these issues were also highlighted in a january 2003 report issued by the sec inspector general .
for example , the federal reserve provided over $323 billion in funding to banks between september 11 and september 14 , 2001 , to prevent organizations from defaulting on their obligations and creating a widespread solvency crisis .
