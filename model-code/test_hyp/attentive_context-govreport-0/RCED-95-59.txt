it focuses on the quality of small businesses' research proposals for technological innovation , the implementation of a provision for technical assistance by agencies participating in the program , and duplicate funding of similar research by more than one agency .
the small business innovation development act of 1982 , which authorized the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program , emphasizes the benefits of technological innovation and the ability of small businesses to transform the results of research and development ( r&d ) into new products .
the act designated four major goals for the program: stimulating technological innovation .
the five largest , accounting for over 90 percent of all sbir awards , include the department of defense ( dod ) ; the department of energy ( doe ) ; the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and its national institutes of health ( nih ) , in particular ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and the national science foundation ( nsf ) .
at the start of our review , the house committee on small business directed us to focus our work on sba as the main administrative agency for the program and on the five major funding agencies ( dod , hhs , nasa , nsf , and doe ) that accounted for more than 90 percent of the total expenditures for sbir projects .
the legislation also required us to address the implementation of the discretionary technical assistance program .
none of the five major agencies have implemented the 1992 discretionary technical assistance provision , and future implementation remains uncertain .
sba and sbir officials were critical of the provision because ( 1 ) it calls for the use of sbir funds , thereby reducing the number of awards the officials can make , ( 2 ) there is little need for technical assistance when projects are selected primarily for their technical merit , ( 3 ) implementation would impose a significant administrative burden arising from case - by - case considerations of companies' requests for support , and ( 4 ) specific requirements , such as selecting a single vendor of technical assistance for each agency , are unrealistic .
concerns about nih's ability to absorb a funding increase have surfaced before .
the report contains three recommendations to the small business administration to reduce the risk of duplicate funding of similar research by small businesses .
within hhs , our review focused on nih , which accounted for almost all of the sbir program at hhs .
this requirement will effectively double the annual funding for the program to about $1 billion .
this report was authorized by the small business research and development enhancement act of 1992 .
in fact , only the first ( and smallest ) of the three scheduled increases in funding had occurred at the time of our review .
to improve interagency coordination and to reduce the risk of duplicate funding of similar research , we recommend that the administrator , sba , take steps to ( 1 ) determine whether the certification form that accompanies sbir proposals needs to be improved and , if so , take the necessary steps to revise it ; ( 2 ) develop substantive definitions and guidelines for agencies and companies regarding “duplicate” research ; and ( 3 ) provide interagency access to current information regarding sbir awards .
