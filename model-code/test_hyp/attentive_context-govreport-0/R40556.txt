a diverse array of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions is currently under way or being developed on the international , national , and sub - national level ( e.g. , individual state actions or regional partnerships ) .
proposals in the u.s. congress have generally focused on market - based approaches , but some proposals have included a mix of market and non - market strategies .
in addition , on may 19 , 2009 , president obama announced a plan to integrate federal fuel economy standards ( under the energy policy and conservation act ) with federal vehicle emissions standards ( under the clean air act ) and state standards ( driven by california's rulemaking action ) .
market - based mechanisms that limit ghg emissions can generally be divided into two types: quantity control ( e.g. , cap - and - trade ) and price control ( e.g. , carbon tax or fee ) .
preference for a carbon tax or a cap - and - trade program ultimately depends on which variable one wants to directly control — emissions or costs .
another potential driver of market - based federal legislation is activity by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) to control ghg emissions under existing clean air act authority .
in the context of these events and efforts , members in the 111 th congress have introduced several proposals that would use market - based approaches to reduce ghg emissions .
to some extent , a carbon tax and a cap - and - trade program would produce similar effects: both are estimated to increase the price of fossil fuels , which would ultimately be borne by consumers , particularly households .
the administration finalized ghg and fuel economy standards in the may 7 , 2010 , federal register .
although members have introduced and debated ghg emission control proposals — both cap - and - trade and carbon tax programs — in previous congresses , the obama administration's stated commitment to ghg emission reduction has spurred interest in developing a workable program .
one of these partnerships — the regional greenhouse gas initiative ( rggi ) — took effect january 2009 .
for example , 23 states have joined one of the three regional partnerships that would require ghg ( or just carbon dioxide ) emission reductions .
some have stated a preference for a cap - and - trade system ; others have indicated a preference for a carbon tax approach .
in the 111 th congress , members have introduced nine bills that include provisions to impose or permit some form of market - based controls on ghg emissions .
this position contrasts starkly with the previous administration , which had rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions , instead focusing on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in ghg emissions ( i.e. , emissions intensity targets ) .
in addition to the policy shift in the executive branch , a number of states have taken actions in recent years that directly address ghg emissions .
on december 15 , 2009 , epa finalized an "endangerment finding" under section 202 of the clean air act , which requires the agency to regulate pollutants due to their ghg impacts .
