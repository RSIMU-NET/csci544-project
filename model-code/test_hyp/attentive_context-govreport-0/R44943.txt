the aia also limited the availability of patents claiming tax avoidance strategies .
most recently , the leahy - smith america invents act ( aia ) of 2011 stipulated that "no patent may issue on a claim directed to or encompassing a human organism. .
the courts and the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) have historically understood the language of section 101 to allow an expansive range of patentable subject matter .
this situation changed over the past decade due to a series of decisions issued by the supreme court of the united states .
some members of congress have expressed interest in the rules governing patentable subject matter for many years .
the term "patentable subject matter" refers to the requirement of section 101 of the patent act of 1952 that an invention must consist of a "process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter" in order to be patented .
other observers believe that these decisions may lead to patents of appropriate scope , curb abusive patent litigation , and encourage patent lawyers to draft and procure higher quality patents .
since the supreme court issued its decisions , section 101 has been more frequently invoked to invalidate issued patents and reject pending patent applications at the uspto .
however , the courts have long held that several implicit exceptions exist to the four categories of patentable subject matter set out in section 101 .
views differ on whether the recent prominence of section 101 in the u.s. patent system has been desirable .
in particular , laws of nature , natural phenomena , and abstract ideas have been held to be unpatentable .
concerned observers have declared the u.s. patent system to be in a "state of crisis" due to "confusing" legal standards established by the supreme court .
this report reviews the current law governing patentable subject matter and recent proposals for legislative reform .
for many years , section 101 was arguably a coarse filter that was rarely used to invalidate an issued patent or reject an application pending at the uspto .
the former chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit , the tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals , reportedly described the supreme court decisions as creating "total chaos" and marking "a very harmful and completely unnecessary departure from a sensible patent policy. .
further , numerous patents granted by the uspto under earlier standards would likely be held invalid if they were subject to scrutiny by the agency or the courts .
four supreme court opinions have issued since 2010 addressing patentable subject matter .
however , other experts express concern that the lack of availability of patent rights will decrease innovation and investment in the united states .
the report closes with a review of legislative reform options .
it begins by providing a basic overview of the patent system and introducing the principles of patentable subject matter .
the report then considers the implications of these decisions within the information technology and life sciences industries .
as of the date this report was published , no bill has been introduced before congress addressing the law of patentable subject since the enactment of the leahy - smith america invents act in 2011 .
