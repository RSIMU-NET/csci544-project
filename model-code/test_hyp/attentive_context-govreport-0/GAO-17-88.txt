in recent years , the u.s. commercial space industry has been expanding — u.s .
launch companies conducted eight launches in 2015 , compared with none in 2011 — and federal law includes insurance requirements for launch companies involved in commercial space launches .
specifically , the commercial space launch act amendments of 1988 ( cslaa ) requires launch companies — firms that operate launch vehicles for launches licensed by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) — to purchase insurance to cover damage to the uninvolved public , or “third parties,” as well as damage to federal government property , in case of a launch mishap .
to better ensure spaceport operators' understanding of faa's financial responsibility regulations for commercial space launches , we recommend that the secretary of transportation ensure that the faa administrator provides additional communication to clarify faa's interpretation of the financial responsibility regulations for commercial space launches .
section 115 of the u.s. commercial space launch competitiveness act ( cslca ) contains a provision for gao to report on the potential inclusion of all government property , including state and municipal property , in the existing indemnification regime established under 51 u.s.c .
faa is currently evaluating its maximum probable loss methodology .
the forms of communication could include , among other things , issuing additional guidance or using other forums to clarify when a spaceport operator is a third party to a launch and when it is not .
furthermore , the national aeronautics and space act ( space act ) authorizes the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) to enter into legal agreements with spaceport operators — entities that host launches at their launch sites ( i.e. , spaceports ) — for use of nasa property in support of commercial space launches , which may include insurance requirements for companies involved in those launches .
we also conducted semistructured interviews with other stakeholders , including five launch companies that are active in the industry , all five key insurance industry stakeholders that had provided coverage to the commercial space industry ( three insurance brokers and two insurance companies ) , and two industry associations .
we reached out to all 10 spaceport operators licensed by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , as of july 2016 , and conducted semistructured interviews with 8 of these 10 spaceport operators .
nevertheless , this event highlighted a potential concern about the adequacy of insurance coverage obtained by faa - licensed spaceport operators , an increasingly key part of the u.s. commercial space industry .
the cslaa also added a requirement , subject to appropriation , for the federal government to indemnify launch companies for claims that exceed their required insurance coverage , up to $1.5 billion adjusted for post - 1988 inflation , which was around $3.06 billion in fiscal year 2016 .
