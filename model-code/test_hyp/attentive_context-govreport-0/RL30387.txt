federal employees participate in one of two retirement systems .
to coordinate federal pension benefits with social security , congress directed the development of a new retirement system for federal employees hired after 1983 .
the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) was established in 1920 and covers only employees hired before 1984 .
because the social security trust funds needed additional cash contributions to remain solvent , the social security amendments of 1983 ( p.l .
the result was the federal employees' retirement system ( fers ) act of 1986 ( p.l .
authority the thrift board has the authority to appoint the executive director of the thrift plan ; remove the executive director for cause ( requires four votes ) ; establish investment policies for the thrift plan ; instruct the director to take whatever actions the board deems appropriate to carry out the policies it establishes ; and submit to congress legislative proposals relating to its responsibilities under federal law .
98-21 ) required federal employees hired after 1983 to participate in social security .
of 2,751,000 federal civilian and postal service employees enrolled in these federal retirement plans as of september 30 , 2013 , 2,477,000 ( 90% ) were participating in the fers and 274,000 ( 10% ) were under the csrs .
participants in the csrs do not pay social security payroll taxes and they do not earn social security benefits .
for a worker retiring after 30 years of federal service , a csrs annuity will be equal to 56.25% of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of basic pay .
communication and education the thrift board communicates with plan participants to help them better understand the investment choices , benefits , and administration of the tsp .
111-31 : provides for newly hired federal employees to be enrolled automatically in the thrift savings plan ( tsp ) at a default contribution rate of 3% of pay ; requires the federal retirement thrift investment board to establish within the tsp a qualified roth contribution program that provides for after - tax contributions and tax - free distributions ; gives the federal retirement thrift investment board authority to allow tsp participants to invest in mutual funds in addition to the five investment funds now included in the tsp ; requires the thrift board to submit to congress an annual report that includes demographic information about tsp participants and fund managers ; requires participants to sign an acknowledgement of risk if they invest contributions in any investment option other than government securities ; grants the executive director of the tsp authority to issue subpoenas under certain circumstances ; allows funds held in an individual's tsp account to be subject to court orders with respect to payment of restitution to victims of certain crimes ; requires the secretary of defense to report to congress the estimated cost of an agency match on contributions to the tsp by members of the uniformed services ; and allows the surviving spouse of a deceased tsp participant to maintain the decedent's account with the tsp .
the replacement rate is shown for employees who make no contribution to the tsp , and thus receive only the agency automatic 1% contribution ; for workers who contribute 5% of pay , and therefore receive a 5% contribution from their employing agencies ; and for workers who contribute 10% of pay , which results in the same 5% agency contribution as would a 5% employee contribution .
