specifically , this testimony discusses ( 1 ) the extent of overlap , fragmentation , and duplication among these programs and the extent to which programs collaborate and ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies collect information necessary to track program activities and whether these programs , have met their performance goals and have been evaluated .
in august 2012 , we reported information on 52 programs at the departments of commerce ( commerce ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and agriculture ( usda ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) that support entrepreneurs .
in january 2011 , congress updated the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) with the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) .
entrepreneurs play a vital role in the u.s. economy , and the federal government provides a variety of support and assistance to them .
in october 2012 , commerce's economic development administration ( eda ) noted that it had recently partnered with two universities to develop a comprehensive set of performance measures that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of its programs .
among other things , gprama requires the office of management and budget ( omb ) to coordinate with agencies to establish outcome - oriented federal government priority goals covering a limited number of policy areas , as well as goals to improve management across the federal government .
these inefficiencies could compromise the government's ability to effectively provide the needed services and meet the shared goals of the programs .
for our august 2012 report , we reviewed statutory and regulatory authority on the activities and services the agencies can conduct to administer each of the programs , and we found significant overlap and fragmentation among programs that provide financial assistance .
in addition , the president's 2013 budget submission established cross - agency priority goals , including one to increase federal services to entrepreneurs and small businesses , with an emphasis on start - ups , growing firms , and underserved markets .
according to agency officials , these programs , which typically fund a variety of activities in addition to supporting entrepreneurs , spent an estimated $2 billion on economic development efforts in fiscal year 2011 .
economic development programs that effectively provide assistance to entrepreneurs , in conjunction with state and local government and private sector economic development initiatives , may help businesses develop and expand .
however , we have found that the ways that these programs have been administered , and the lack of data collection and program evaluations , could lead to inefficient delivery of services .
we will report on the actions taken by the agencies as we do for other areas included in our mandated work addressing federal programs with fragmentation , overlap , and duplication .
we look forward to continuing to work with the agencies as well as this and other congressional committees in addressing ways to assist entrepreneurs in the most effective and efficient manner .
gprama established a new framework aimed at taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing on results and improving government performance .
gprama also highlighted the importance of program evaluation for federal agencies .
of these 52 programs , 30 programs distributed across the four agencies can support entrepreneurs through financial assistance in the form of grants and loans .
