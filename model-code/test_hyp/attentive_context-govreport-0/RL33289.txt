social security plays an important role in reducing poverty , not only among the aged but among children as well .
in fy2013 , combined federal and state tanf expenditures , in the form of cash aid to families , amounted to an estimated $8.7 billion , of which approximately $4.3 billion ( 49% ) was from federal funds .
this report examines the effects of social security on child poverty .
social security administration ( ssa ) data indicate that in december 2012 , 3.3 million social security beneficiaries ( 5.7% of all beneficiaries ) were children under the age of 18 .
children may be eligible for social security benefits when a parent who is a covered worker dies , becomes disabled , or retires .
in order to address questions relating to the income and poverty status of families in which children live , and the impact of social security benefits on income and poverty status of families with children , other data sources must be used .
among child beneficiaries , 1.2 million ( 37.2% of all child beneficiaries ) were children of deceased workers , 1.7 million ( 52.9% of all child beneficiaries ) were children of disabled workers , and about 322,000 ( 8.9% of all child beneficiaries ) were dependent children of retired workers .
in addition to receiving social security benefits in their own right , children may economically benefit from social security by living with other family members who receive benefits .
the estimates presented in this report are based on a crs analysis of u.s. census bureau survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data in april 2013 .
for this analysis , u.s. census bureau survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data are used in this report .
unlike welfare programs , in which eligibility is determined on the basis of limited income , social security is a work - related entitlement , in which benefits are determined on the basis of workers' employment and earnings history , without respect to current income .
child benefits generally apply to all biological children of a worker ( assuming that paternity / maternity has been established ) and to legally adopted children .
 ( the pia is based on the parent's social security earnings record. ) .
while ssa administrative data provide a broad overview of the numbers of individuals receiving social security benefits and the type and amount of benefits received , they provide little information about the characteristics of individuals receiving benefits or the importance of social security to individual and family economic well - being .
for children of disabled or retired workers , the child's benefit is generally equal to 50% of the parent's primary insurance amount ( pia ) before adjustments .
social security benefits paid on behalf of children exceed federal dollars spent on cash welfare to families with children under the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) program .
it should also be noted that estimates of the pre - transfer poverty status of children ( i.e. , poverty status excluding social security from total income ) provide one measure of the relative importance of social security in combating poverty .
