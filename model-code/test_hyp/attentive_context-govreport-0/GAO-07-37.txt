the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) identify the key practices that selected u.s. cities are using to increase recycling , ( 2 ) describe what the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the department of commerce ( commerce ) are doing to encourage recycling nationwide , and ( 3 ) identify federal policy options that stakeholders with recycling expertise believe could help increase recycling .
we also recommend that the secretary of commerce develop and implement a strategy to stimulate the development of markets for recycled materials in the united states to fully meet its responsibilities under rcra subtitle e .
epa agreed with our recommendation to establish performance measures and gather comprehensive performance data to evaluate the impact of its recycling programs .
we recommend that the administrator , epa , establish performance measures and gather comprehensive performance data to evaluate the impact of epa's recycling programs to ensure that the agency's available resources are utilized in the most effective and efficient manner .
in 2005 , the united states generated about 246 million tons of municipal solid waste , or over 1,600 pounds per person , according to the most current environmental protection agency ( epa ) estimates .
moreover , epa stated that during fiscal years 2007 and 2008 , the agency intends to develop performance measures for key aspects of its municipal waste reduction program .
in 1976 , the congress sought to reduce solid waste and encourage recycling as part of the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) .
under its resource conservation challenge ( rcc ) , epa operates several national and regional programs to support public and private sector efforts to increase recycling and to help epa reach its goal of recycling 35 percent of national municipal solid waste by 2008 .
in addition , manufacturing products from recycled material can provide economic benefits to the extent that it requires less electricity , fuel , and water , which can result in lower production costs .
without performance information to guide its efforts , epa has no way of knowing the extent to which its resources are being directed toward activities that are of the greatest benefit in helping to achieve the national recycling goal .
you asked us to ( 1 ) identify the key practices that selected u.s. cities are using to increase recycling , ( 2 ) describe what epa and commerce are doing to encourage recycling nationwide , and ( 3 ) identify federal policy options that stakeholders with recycling expertise believe could help increase recycling .
although epa has implemented several programs at the national and regional levels to encourage recycling , their effectiveness is unknown .
additionally , without a commitment by commerce to actively encourage recycling by stimulating the development of markets for recycled materials in the united states , municipalities may have little incentive to recycle certain materials .
while epa receives information about the accomplishments of some of its recycling programs , the agency has not established performance measures to help determine the extent to which its programs are contributing to meeting the national recycling goal of 35 percent by 2008 .
for example , some states require municipalities to offer recycling programs ; 11 states have laws requiring deposits on beverage cans and bottles known as “bottle bills” ; and several states have passed electronic waste legislation , such as “extended producer responsibility laws” that require manufacturers to offer “take back” programs under which consumers may return computers and other electronic equipment for recycling .
