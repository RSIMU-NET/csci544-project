to meet the requirements of the directive and provide congress with a comprehensive accounting of u.s. assistance to afghanistan for fiscal years 2002 – 2003 , we ( 1 ) analyzed u.s. obligations and expenditures ; ( 2 ) identified the results of assistance projects through september 30 , 2003 ; ( 3 ) evaluated u.s. and international assistance coordination mechanisms and the u.s. assistance strategy ; and ( 4 ) examined the major obstacles that affected the achievement of u.s. policy goals and the reconstruction effort .
section 106 of the act directs the u.s. general accounting office ( gao ) to monitor u.s. humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to afghanistan .
the act articulates u.s. policy goals in afghanistan that include the creation of a stable afghan society that is not a threat to itself or others and is not a base for terrorism .
with the passage of the afghanistan freedom support act in december 2002 , congress authorized the use of federal funds for the delivery of humanitarian , development , and security assistance to afghanistan .
state emphasized that despite security and other challenges , significant progress had been made , not only with respect to humanitarian and short - term assistance , but also in advancing long - term security , reconstruction , and governance objectives .
in october 2001 , responding to its protection of al qaeda terrorists who had attacked the united states , coalition forces forcibly removed the taliban regime .
further , most of the u.s. agencies providing assistance to afghanistan did not have readily available comprehensive financial data on their efforts , limiting the ability of individuals and institutions charged with coordinating and overseeing the assistance to execute these responsibilities .
consequently , overall progress towards afghanistan's reconstruction goals by the end of fiscal year 2003 was limited .
