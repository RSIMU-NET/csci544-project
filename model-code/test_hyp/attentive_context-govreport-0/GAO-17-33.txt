this report describes ( 1 ) what is known about the extent of elder abuse by guardians ; and ( 2 ) what measures federal agencies and selected state and local guardianship programs have taken to help protect older adults with guardians from abuse .
the federal government does not regulate or directly support guardianship , but federal agencies may provide indirect support to state guardianship programs by providing funding for efforts to share best practices and facilitate improved coordination .
we also conducted interviews with various guardianship stakeholders including the following: federal agencies including the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , bureau of consumer financial protection ( cfpb ) , and department of justice to discuss efforts to support to state guardianship programs .
in 2014 , the u.s. census bureau estimated that there were over 46 million older adults — individuals aged 65 and over — in the united states .
because of your concern about the financial exploitation and other abuses of older adults , you asked us to review whether abusive practices by guardians are widespread .
while many guardians act in the best interest of persons under guardianship , some have been reported to engage in the abuse of older adults .
the social security administration ( ssa ) , the department of veterans affairs , and the office of personnel management have programs that appoint representative payees to manage federal benefits received by individuals who are unable to do so for themselves .
in addition , some agencies have established programs that appoint representative payees to manage federal benefits for individuals who are unable to do so for themselves .
generally , guardianships are legal relationships created when a state court grants one person or entity the authority and responsibility to make decisions in the best interest of an incapacitated individual — which can include an older adult — concerning his or her person or property .
the census bureau predicts this number will nearly double to 88 million by 2050 .
to determine what is known about the extent of elder abuse by guardians , we reviewed relevant research , reports , studies , and other publications issued by organizations with expertise on elder abuse and guardianship issues .
when an older adult becomes incapable of making informed decisions , a guardianship may be necessary .
to identify measures federal agencies and selected state and local guardianship programs have taken to help protect older adults with guardians from abuse , we reviewed relevant research , publications , and other materials on elder abuse and guardianship .
we also interviewed officials from the social security administration ( ssa ) , the department of veterans affairs , and office of personnel management to discuss their representative payee programs .
the survey collected information regarding appointment , monitoring , and discipline of guardians ; caseloads and electronic case - management capabilities ; and court interaction with federal agencies and other organizations .
more specifically , we found that information about ssa's incapable beneficiaries and their representative payees could help state courts ( 1 ) avoid appointing individuals who , while serving as ssa representative payees , have misused beneficiaries' ssa payments in the past , and ( 2 ) provide courts with potential candidates for guardians when there are no others available .
