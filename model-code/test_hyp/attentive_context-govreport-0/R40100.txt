this report examines the dynamics of this issue in three parts: ( 1 ) exploration of the nature of the problem with respect to international climate change policy , potential environmental effects , and potential economic effects ; ( 2 ) identification of a range of possible options to address concerns ; ( 3 ) analysis of issues raised by the proposed mitigating approaches and options ; and ( 4 ) implications of the various approaches .
there are three components of the problem of differentiated global carbon policies with respect to trade: ( 1 ) the lack of an international agreement with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gases ; ( 2 ) the issue of carbon leakage ; and ( 3 ) economic and competitive effects .
as the debate on reducing greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) has progressed , increasing concern has been raised about how a u.s. reduction program would interact with programs in other countries .
there are three basic approaches to assisting greenhouse - gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries: ( 1 ) assist domestic industry ; ( 2 ) penalize foreign competitors ; and ( 3 ) develop alternative sectoral approaches .
the risks accompanying establishment of carbon control policies , in the absence of similar policies among competing nations , have been central to debates on whether the united states should enact greenhouse gas legislation .
specifically , concerns have been raised that if the united states adopts a carbon control policy , industries that must control their emissions or that find their feedstock or energy bills rising because of costs passed - through by suppliers may be less competitive and may lose global market share ( and jobs ) to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies .
in response to these concerns , several proposals introduced in congress would attempt to mitigate the effect of carbon policies on affected u.s. industry .
in a global context where currently some countries have legally binding policies to reduce greenhouse gas emission and other countries do not — i.e. , differentiated global carbon policies — the potential exists that countries imposing carbon control policies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage vis - à - vis countries without comparable policies .
two of the most common options are ( 1 ) subsidies for affected industries through allocation of free allowances within cap - and - trade policies ; and ( 2 ) border adjustments through an international reserve allowance program .
 ) , and ( 2 ) discussions of specific options .
in addition , this potential shift in production could result in some of the u.s. carbon reductions being diluted by increased production in more carbon intensive countries ( commonly known as "carbon leakage" ) .
proposed mitigating actions include , for example , providing assistance to greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries , or imposing tariffs on certain greenhouse gas - intensive goods imported into the country from countries not implementing comparable carbon policies .
this section is divided into two components: ( 1 ) general issues and questions raised by the various approaches ( design , effects , etc .
duration options for such an approach would include anticipated technology or best practices advancements ( or best currently available ) , consummation of an international agreement , or some criterion related to the economic health of the sector or industry .
