visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is a governmentwide program for controlling and monitoring the pre - entry , entry , visa status , and exit of foreign visitors .
require , through agreements , that agencies managing contract actions on the program office's behalf implement effective contract management practices consistent with acquisition guidance for all us - visit contract actions , including , at a minimum , ( 1 ) establishing and maintaining a plan for performing contract management activities ; ( 2 ) assigning responsibility and authority for performing contract oversight ; ( 3 ) training the people performing contract oversight ; ( 4 ) documenting the contract ; ( 5 ) verifying that deliverables satisfy requirements ; ( 6 ) monitoring contractor - related risk ; and ( 7 ) monitoring contractor performance to ensure that the contractor is meeting schedule , effort , cost , and technical performance requirements .
our objective was to determine whether the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established and implemented effective controls for managing and overseeing contracts related to the u.s .
develop and implement practices for overseeing contractor work managed by other agencies on the program office's behalf , including ( 1 ) clearly defining roles and responsibilities for both the program office and all agencies managing us - visit – related contracts ; ( 2 ) having current , reliable , and timely information on the full scope of contract actions and activities ; and ( 3 ) defining and implementing steps to verify that deliverables meet requirements .
by impairing the reliability and effectiveness of accounting for us - visit contracts , these weaknesses have diminished the program's ability to effectively manage and oversee work performed by contractors — work that is essential for the program to achieve its goals .
in doing so , dhs has relied heavily on contractor support , obtained through multiple existing contracts managed by several dhs and non - dhs agencies .
as previous audits have shown , dhs suffers from numerous material weaknesses in financial management , some of which are directly related to ice ( the dhs component that provides financial management services to the program office ) .
because of the importance of effective contractor management and oversight to this program , you asked us to determine whether the department has established and implemented effective controls for managing and overseeing us - visit – related contractors .
the department is taking an incremental approach to acquiring and implementing us - visit , with the initial increments focused on enhancing existing systems , modifying facilities , and augmenting program office staff .
until dhs addresses these contract management and oversight weaknesses , the us - visit program will remain at risk of not delivering required capabilities and promised benefits on time and within budget , and it will be vulnerable to financial mismanagement .
other key practices were only partially implemented or not implemented by all agencies .
to achieve this objective , we reviewed the contracting policies and procedures of dhs and non - dhs agencies responsible for us - visit – related contracts .
require dhs and non - dhs agencies that manage contracts on behalf of the program to ( 1 ) clearly define and delineate us - visit work from non - us - visit work as performed by contractors ; ( 2 ) record , at the contract level , amounts being billed and expended on us - visit – related work so that these can be tracked and reported separately from amounts not for us - visit purposes ; and ( 3 ) determine if they have received reimbursement from the program for payments not related to us - visit work by contractors , and if so , refund to the program any amount received in error .
