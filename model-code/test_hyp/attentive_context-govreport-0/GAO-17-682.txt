to help increase efficiency when defining fms requirements to be placed on contract , we recommend that the secretary of defense issue department - wide guidance for the military departments and dod components to expand the use of requirements checklists to develop more comprehensive letters of request for fms cases .
the house report 114-537 that accompanied the national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2017 included a provision for gao to review certain aspects of department of defense's ( dod ) acquisition process , including contract type selection , to determine their effect , if any , on foreign military sales ( fms ) .
the department of state ( state ) has overall responsibility for the program , including the approval of sales .
each year , the u.s. government reports billions of dollars in sales of defense articles and services to foreign governments through the foreign military sales ( fms ) program .
further , in the fiscal year 2017 national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) , congress required dod to revise its acquisition regulations to place new requirements on fms contracting and to seek ways to accelerate contracting and pricing for fms .
over the past decade , dod and congress have established various reform efforts designed to expedite the fms process , yet there is continued concern that the process remains slow .
for instance , the defense security cooperation agency ( dsca ) , which is responsible for overseeing and administering the fms program within dod , reported implementation of the lead nation procurement initiative in july 2016 , which is aimed at maximizing purchasing power for north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) members through joint procurement of defense articles and services .
although checklists , when developed and available for use , help fms customers and military departments define requirements more efficiently , they have not been developed for all systems that are procured under the fms program .
the fms acquisition process continues to be hindered by insufficiently defined requirements that do not fully articulate the desired equipment , training , and other services and can , from the outset , impede timely delivery to fms customers .
more importantly , these tools can help ensure dod is well - positioned , at the outset , to deliver equipment and services to the foreign government within agreed - upon timeframes .
the fms program is a central component of the u.s. government's efforts to assist foreign governments by providing u.s. military equipment and related services .
we provided a draft of this report to the department of defense ( dod ) for comment .
the fms program is considered an integral component of u.s. national security and foreign policy that enhances the capabilities of our allies and supports increased interoperability with the u.s. military , while also helping to sustain the defense industrial base .
however , the department of defense ( dod ) administers the fms program and manages procurements executed by acquisition programs within the military departments and other dod components on behalf of foreign governments .
this report addresses 1 ) how the use of firm - fixed - price contracts compares to other contract types awarded for fms procurements and the reasons they were used and 2 ) the factors that may contribute to delays and potentially increase costs for fms procurements .
