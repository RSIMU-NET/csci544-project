our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess the extent to which flows of money into mutual funds were affecting the amount of deposits at banks and ( 2 ) determine what impact such flows might have on the availability of finance for the economy as a whole and for residential , consumer , and business borrowers .
this letter responds to the committee's request that we examine whether the movement of funds from bank deposits into mutual funds affects the availability of credit for residential , consumer , or commercial purposes .
we assessed two quantitative approaches: ( 1 ) the total net flows into mutual funds and ( 2 ) ici's estimate of the impact on deposits .
in addition , we did a literature search for research articles examining ( 1 ) how residential , consumer , and business borrowers obtain financing , not only from bank loans or securities issuance but also from other sources and ( 2 ) how lenders , including banks as well as nonbank providers such as finance companies , funded the financing they provided and whether they sold or securitized their finance .
there remains the possibility that some borrowers from small banks might face credit availability constraints in certain circumstances , but it is not clear whether those circumstances currently exist .
in addition , the relative importance of bank loans has been further diminished by the increased provision of direct loans by nonbank financial intermediaries , including securities firms , insurance companies , and finance companies .
the household sector ( generally residential and consumer borrowers ) also has become less dependent on bank loans for the ultimate source of financing .
in its letter , the federal reserve stated that the report provides a timely review of the flow of funds between mutual funds and bank deposits and the effect of these flows on credit availability .
banks generally use their deposits either to make loans or to invest in certain debt securities , principally government bonds .
to assess the impact of mutual funds' growth on the total supply of loanable and investable funds , we examined the flow of funds accounts data on the sources of finance for the economy .
money from these funds , in turn , flows either directly ( through primary securities markets ) or indirectly ( through secondary securities markets ) to the issuers of such securities .
for longer - term mutual funds , however , the period - to - period change in the fund's value generally does not equal the net flows during the period because the value fluctuates with ( 1 ) the flows of customer money , ( 2 ) the changing prices of the stocks and bonds held by the mutual funds , and ( 3 ) the reinvestment of dividends and interest in the fund .
both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries , that is , they raise funds from savers and channel these funds back to the economy by investing them .
the federal reserve said it had no further comment regarding the report or its content because the report made no recommendations to the federal reserve .
this third approach also has limitations because there are a variety of factors that affect the relationship between deposits and gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
