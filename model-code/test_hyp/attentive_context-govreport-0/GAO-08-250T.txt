the smithsonian has been referred to as america's museum , as its museums hold and provide access to irreplaceable national collections in american and natural history , art , and other areas .
my statement focuses on three topics: ( 1 ) the smithsonian's real property management efforts , including the condition of the smithsonian's facilities , costs of facilities' projects , and efforts to improve real property security and portfolio management ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the smithsonian has developed and implemented strategies to fund its revitalization , construction , and maintenance projects as we recommended in 2005 ; and ( 3 ) some preliminary results of our ongoing work on governance changes being made by the smithsonian's board of regents to address recent governance problems .
since its beginning , the smithsonian has evolved into the world's largest museum complex and research organization ; two of its museums on the national mall in washington , d.c. , are the most visited in the world .
in response to concerns about the smithsonian's governance raised by the former secretary's compensation and expenses , as well as other issues , two studies were conducted , one by the board of regents' governance committee and the other by an independent review committee ( irc ) created at the request of the board of regents .
in recent years , the national academy of public administration ( napa ) , the smithsonian , and we have reported on the deterioration of the smithsonian's facilities and the threat posed by this deterioration to the smithsonian's collections .
in april 2005 , we reported that the smithsonian's current funding would not be sufficient to cover its estimated $2.3 billion in facilities projects through 2013 and recommended that the smithsonian board of regents develop and implement a funding plan to address the smithsonian's facilities projects .
the board of regents adopted all 25 of the governance committee's recommendations and stated that the irc recommendations were for the most part encompassed by the governance committee recommendations .
recently , it has come to light that in addition to the challenge of addressing the smithsonian's facilities needs , the board of regents faces other governance challenges .
in the past year , following a report from the smithsonian's inspector general to the board of regents on the smithsonian's former secretary's compensation package and expenses , the former secretary resigned .
the smithsonian's annual operating and capital program revenues come from its own private trust fund assets and federal appropriations ; however , the majority of funds for facilities come from the smithsonian's federal appropriations .
as the smithsonian's chief decision - making body , the smithsonian board of regents is responsible for the long - term stewardship of the smithsonian's mission , which includes maintaining the smithsonian's facilities and collections , as well as ensuring that the smithsonian has a funding strategy that provides sufficient funds to support these activities .
among the findings of these studies were that the roles and responsibilities of regents were not clearly defined ; under the former secretary of the smithsonian , key senior officials such as the general counsel , inspector general , and chief financial officer were isolated from the board ; and the regents did not routinely receive or request information necessary to support vigorous deliberation , well - reasoned decision making , and adequate oversight .
