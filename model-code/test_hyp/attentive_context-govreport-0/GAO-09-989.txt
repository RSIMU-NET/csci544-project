we examined ( 1 ) the emergency services that the department of state ( state ) provides u.s. citizens , ( 2 ) how state is prepared to assist u.s. citizens in need of emergency services , and ( 3 ) how state monitors the assistance it provides u.s. citizens in need of emergency services .
this report addresses: ( 1 ) what services state provides to u.s. citizens who are the victims of crimes , suffer accidents , or otherwise need emergency services ; ( 2 ) how state is prepared to assist u.s. citizens in need of emergency services ; and ( 3 ) how state monitors the assistance it provides to u.s. citizens in need of emergency services .
serving and protecting the nearly 5 million americans who reside overseas as well as the u.s. citizens who take more than 64 million trips to foreign countries each year are chief priorities of the department of state ( state ) .
while state provides a wide range of emergency services to american citizens overseas , state's ability to comprehensively analyze the global demand for these services is hampered by limitations with its data systems .
we also reviewed the training , guidance , and support provided for consular staff , and interviewed foreign service officers ( fso ) and locally employed staff ( les ) about the training and resources available for american citizen services ( acs ) related activities .
ensuring better access to emergency assistance information is supposed to be a redesign priority and should be implemented in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 , with other changes to the site completed over the remaining part of the fiscal year .
we also reviewed state's performance reports for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and its annual performance plan for fiscal year 2009 to ascertain how it was measuring and monitoring its acs emergency services effort .
in response , the u.s. embassy in beijing aided the victim's family by coordinating assistance with chinese officials and the police , as well as the hospital and funeral home ; assisting with repatriating the deceased's remains ; and directing the family to the various services available to victims of crime overseas .
state's 260-plus embassies and consulates around the world have staff dedicated to assisting americans facing emergencies overseas , such as providing death notification to the next of kin , or visiting americans who have been arrested to ensure they are being treated humanely and understand the charges against them and the country's judicial process .
discrepancies with emergency services data , such as deaths and arrests , that consular affairs provided to us for fiscal year 2003 through 2008 further illustrated reliability problems with its data .
as a result , the bureau does not know the global demand for its services or if it is allocating its resources effectively .
current state data indicate the number of u.s. citizens traveling , working , and studying abroad continues to grow , leading to a growing number of americans who may need u.s. government - provided emergency services during their travel .
the system's lack of reliable data is partly attributable to unclear guidance regarding whether certain kinds of information should be entered into the system .
