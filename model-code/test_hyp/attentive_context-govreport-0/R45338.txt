from the ear liest days of commercial radio , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and its predecessor , the federal radio commission , have encouraged diversity in broadcasting .
the fcc's policies seek to encourage four distinct types of diversity in local broadcast media: diversity of viewpoints , as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives ; diversity of programming , as indicated by a variety of formats and content , including programming aimed at various minority and ethnic groups ; outlet diversity , to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market ; and minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets .
in addition to promoting diversity , the fcc aims , with its broadcast media ownership rules , to promote localism and competition by restricting the number of media outlets that a single entity may own or control within a geographic market and , in the case of broadcast television stations , nationwide .
localism addresses whether broadcast stations are responsive to the needs and interests of their communities .
the fcc has five distinct sets of rules governing ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market: ( 1 ) local television ownership rules ( known as the television duopoly rules ) ; ( 2 ) local radio ownership rules ; ( 3 ) radio / television cross - ownership rules ; ( 4 ) newspaper / broadcast cross - ownership rules ; and ( 5 ) the dual network rule .
in 2016 , the fcc adopted a new order ( 2016 diversity order ) containing rules designed to increase broadcast ownership diversity .
in evaluating the extent of competition , the fcc considers whether stations have adequate commercial incentives to invest in diverse news and public affairs programming tailored to serve viewers within their communities .
the debate over media ownership rules is occurring against the background of sweeping changes in news consumption patterns .
as a result of this history , and appeals of previous fcc actions imposing rules to foster diversity of broadcast ownership , the third circuit court of appeals is overseeing the fcc's efforts to foster diversity of broadcast station ownership .
the fcc had also used this revenue - based eligible entity standard in its previous 2008 ownership diversity rulemaking ( 2008 diversity order ) .
the fcc has a long history of attempts to adopt rules to encourage diverse broadcast station ownership , including ownership by women and members of minority groups .
similar to the reinstated definition of eligible entities , these measures are the same as those previously adopted in the fcc's 2008 diversity order .
the fcc adopted six measures in the 2016 diversity order that are designed to enable eligible entities to abide by less restrictive media ownership and attribution rules , and more flexible licensing policies , than their counterparts .
examples of the fcc's attempts are described within several of its past media ownership reviews , including the adoption of the failed station solicitation rule and the establishment of a class of "eligible entities" that could qualify for relaxed ownership rules , attribution rules , and more flexible licensing policies than their counterparts .
the fcc noted that congress would be able to adopt legislation either authorizing or mandating tax certificates and tax credits in the agency's incubator program , either in addition to or in lieu of the fcc local radio ownership rule waiver .
