we are pleased to be here to discuss the results of our september 2013 report , which the subcommittee is releasing today , and the efforts of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) federal protective service ( fps ) to protect the nearly 9,600 federal facilities that are under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) .
fps is authorized ( 1 ) to protect the buildings , grounds , and property that are under the control and custody of gsa , as well as the persons on the property ; ( 2 ) to enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting such property and persons on the property ; and ( 3 ) to investigate fps conducts its mission offenses against these buildings and persons .
testimony discusses ( 1 ) challenges fps faces in ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and ( 2 ) the extent to which fps and select federal agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies align with federal risk assessment standards issued by the interagency security committee ( isc ) .
the 2012 shooting at the anderson federal building in long beach , california , and the results of our 2009 covert testing and fps's ongoing penetration testing demonstrate the continued vulnerability of federal facilities .
the nine selected agencies include: department of energy , office of health , safety , and security ; department of interior ; department of justice , justice protective service ; department of state , diplomatic security ; department of veterans affairs ; federal emergency management agency ; federal protective service ; nuclear regulatory commission ; and office of personnel management .
risk assessments help decision - makers identify and evaluate security risks and implement protective measures to mitigate the potential undesirable effects of these risks .
gao , federal protective service: challenges with oversight of contract guard program still exist , and additional management controls are needed , gao - 13-694 ( washington , d.c.: september 2013 ) .
moreover , the challenge of protecting federal facilities is one of the major reasons why we have designated federal real property management as a high - risk area .
by providing security services through two types of activities: ( 1 ) physical security activities — conducting security assessments and recommending countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents — and ( 2 ) law enforcement activities — proactively patrolling facilities , responding to incidents , conducting criminal investigations , and exercising arrest authority .
for instance , in 2012 , we reported that fps's ability to protect and secure federal facilities has been hampered by the absence of a risk assessment program that is consistent with federal standards .
to identify the management controls and processes fps and the guard companies use to ensure compliance with training , certification , and qualification requirements , we reviewed fps's procedures for ( 1 ) conducting monthly guard file reviews ; ( 2 ) documenting compliance with guard training , certification , and qualification requirements ; and ( 3 ) monitoring performance .
isc's risk assessment standards state that agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies must: consider all of the undesirable events identified by isc as possible risks to federal facilities , and assess the threat , vulnerability , and consequence of specific undesirable events .
