on our own initiative , we conducted a follow - up review to identify ( 1 ) how long federal agencies took to enter fugitives onto the wanted person file ; ( 2 ) what information the agencies had on entry times and the means used to monitor entry times ; and ( 3 ) what actions agencies took , considered , or could take to reduce any entry delays .
then , we interviewed officials and reviewed various documents from the department of justice's fbi , immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) , and united states marshals service ( usms ) and from the department of the treasury's bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms ( atf ) and the customs service .
as a result of our earlier work on interagency coordination in apprehending federal fugitives , we noted that many entries in the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) national crime information center's ( ncic ) wanted person file were made long after issuance of the arrest warrants.this was generally contrary to the stated policies of the agencies that made the entries and the generally accepted view of ncic officials , the international association of chiefs of police , and others that timely use of the file facilitates apprehension and reduces risks to law enforcement personnel and the general public .
these agencies accounted for 22,903 ( 78 percent ) of the 29,339 federal fugitive records on the wanted person file as of april 6 and were the principal fugitive - hunting agencies within the justice and treasury departments .
responsible justice and treasury officials provided oral comments at meetings on december 5 ( treasury ) and december 11 , 1995 ( justice ) .
to accomplish our objectives , we analyzed various information , including federal fugitive records on the wanted person file as of april 6 , 1994 .
because the attorney general is the chief official responsible for the wanted person file and since the agencies we reviewed are under your jurisdictions , we are reporting our findings to you .
we performed our work in washington , d.c. , from may 1995 to august 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
we reviewed these two departments in our earlier fugitive work as well .
for example , usms officials said there might have been some delays in their being notified by ( 1 ) the courts of persons who failed to make a required court appearance or ( 2 ) the drug enforcement administration regarding drug case fugitives that the usms is responsible for pursuing .
generally , federal fugitives are persons whose whereabouts are unknown and who ( 1 ) are being sought because they have been charged with one or more federal crimes ; ( 2 ) have failed to appear for a required court action or for deportation ; or ( 3 ) have escaped from federal custody .
our objectives , scope , and methodology are discussed in more detail in appendix i .
we also interviewed them as to any ( 1 ) current information they might have on entry policies and times ; ( 2 ) means their agencies had for staying abreast of entry times and for ensuring timely entries ; ( 3 ) known or possible causes and effects of delayed entries ; and ( 4 ) actions that had been taken to address entry time problems or actions that would be or could be taken as a result of our findings .
