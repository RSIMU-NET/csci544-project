iran's ballistic missile program dates to the late 1970s after the shah was overthrown and the islamic republic of iran established .
this is because there is little transparency in iran's ballistic missile programs , which has led to some degree of a lack of confidence in iran's public assertions of its activities .
the new iranian government embarked on a ballistic missile program marked by considerable secrecy .
iranian ballistic missile proliferation has been a matter of u.s. and international concern .
many consider that iran's ballistic missile development was in full force by the mid - 1980s during its protracted war against iraq , during which iran reportedly launched more than 600 ballistic missiles .
ballistic missile defense ( bmd ) program in general and the u.s. proposed missile defense system in europe specifically , as well as u.s. diplomatic efforts to curb iranian long - range ballistic missile programs .
because of the secrecy inherent in the development of weapon systems , especially in less open societies , open - source analyses reflect a wide - range of technical views and assessments .
finally , details about iranian ballistic missile programs remain classified in the united states .
today , there is little disagreement among most experts that iran has acquired some number of ballistic missiles from other countries and has developed other ballistic missiles indigenously or in cooperation with others .
this report first examines iran's long - range ballistic missile programs because those efforts generally drive the greatest concerns within the united states , especially when coupled with concern over the development of iran's nuclear capabilities .
at the same time , however , there has been considerable public disagreement over precisely what kinds of ballistic missile systems iran has or is developing itself or in cooperation with others .
traditionally , the united states has defined long - range or intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbms ) as those ballistic missiles capable of ranges greater than 5,500 kilometers ( about 3,400 miles ) .
this report provides a brief description of what is publicly discussed regarding iran's ballistic missile programs ; it does not discuss iranian cruise missiles or rockets .
to date , five countries have deployed operational icbms ( all with nuclear weapons ) : the united states , russia , china , france , and britain .
some reports suggest that iran has already deployed a number of medium - range ballistic missiles ( mrbms ) .
in early february 2009 , iran successfully launched its omid ( hope ) satellite on a safir - 2 ( or ambassador - 2 ) rocket , which has a range of about 155 miles .
these latter weapons were a source of concern when some reportedly iranian - made rockets and other missiles may have been used by hezbollah against israel in 2006 .
these assessments drive u.s. military efforts designed to respond to such threats , such as the u.s .
a brief overview of iran's medium and short - range ballistic missile programs then follows .
these assessments , in conjunction with official u.s. assessments of iranian nuclear weapons development , contribute significantly to ongoing u.s. concerns over iranian threats to u.s. and international security .
bush administration officials said iran did not test new technologies or capabilities , but said the missile launches were evidence of the need for its proposed missile defense system in europe .
