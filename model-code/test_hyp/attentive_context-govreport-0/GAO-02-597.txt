the three largest federal disability programs providing cash assistance , which are administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , in 2001 collectively provided $89.7 billion in cash benefits to approximately 10.2 million adults with a physical or mental condition that reduced their earning capacity .
in this report , we review the extent to which di , ssi , and va's disability criteria have been updated based on ( 1 ) scientific advances , including medical and technological innovations ; and ( 2 ) labor market changes , including the growth in service - and knowledge - based industries over manufacturing - based industries .
ssa administers both the disability insurance ( di ) program and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
with such an extensive cash outlay and such a large beneficiary population , it is important to use updated scientific , workforce , and economic information to evaluate claims for disability benefits .
over time , progress in the fields of medicine and technology has provided a better understanding of how disease and injury affect the ability to work .
study and report to congress the effect that a comprehensive consideration of medical treatment and assistive technologies would have on the va disability programs' eligibility criteria and benefit package .
together , scientific advances and labor market changes redefine the extent that physical or mental conditions affect the ability of people with disabilities to work .
if federal disability programs do not update scientific and labor market information used in assessing program eligibility , they risk overestimating the limiting nature of some disabilities while underestimating others .
but nevertheless , without a comprehensive analysis about alternatives and their impacts , it is likely that little progress will be made .
although the three largest federal disability programs differ in their underlying purpose , they face a similar underlying challenge .
the analysis should estimate the effects on the size , cost , and management of the program and other relevant va programs and identify the legislative action , if any , necessary to initiate and fund such change .
study and report to congress the effect that a comprehensive consideration of medical treatment and assistive technologies would have on the di and ssi programs' eligibility criteria and benefit package .
we also discuss implications of incorporating these advances and changes into the programs .
all three programs have experienced growth in recent years .
moreover , not keeping abreast of this information puts federal programs at risk of undermining their efforts to help some persons with disabilities achieve economic independence or work to their full potential .
likewise , changes in the labor market have affected the skills needed to perform work and the settings in which work occurs .
updating disability criteria within existing program structures is prudent , not only as a means to best ensure program integrity , but also for agencies to meet their fiduciary responsibilities for public funds .
in the past , we and others have reported the di , ssi , and va programs as being out - of - step with medical and technological advances and changes in the workforce and the economy .
