medicare advantage ( ma ) plans are an alternative to original medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) in which private plans provide medicare benefits to enrolled beneficiaries .
enrollment in ma plans has grown substantially in recent years from about 4.7 million beneficiaries in june 2004 to 9.6 million — about 1 out of every 5 medicare beneficiaries — as of june 2008 .
this increase in enrollment followed the enactment of the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 , which among other things , resulted in increased payments to ma plans .
this appendix explains the scope and methodology that we used to address our reporting objectives that ( 1 ) compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in private fee - for - service ( pffs ) plans to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs ; ( 2 ) describe the financial risks that beneficiaries in pffs plans face , compared to beneficiaries in other medicare advantage ( ma ) plans and medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) , if they do not contact their plan prior to receiving services ; and ( 3 ) compare the rates at which beneficiaries in pffs plans disenroll to the rates for other ma plans and evaluate whether the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) met statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries .
we recommend that the acting administrator of cms take the following three actions: investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in pffs plans are faced with unexpected out - of - pocket costs due to the denial of coverage when they did not obtain an advance coverage determination from their plan ; ensure that cms guidance on prior authorization accurately reflects cms policy and that pffs plan materials conform to cms requirements ; and mail to medicare beneficiaries ma plan disenrollment rates for the previous 2 years for ma plans that are or will be available in their areas , as required by statute , and update disenrollment rates provided to medicare beneficiaries through moc .
ma plans are able to use the increased payments to offer more benefits and reduce beneficiary cost sharing relative to medicare ffs .
our report addresses the following objectives: ( 1 ) compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in pffs plans to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs ; ( 2 ) describe the financial risks that beneficiaries in pffs plans face , compared to beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs , if they do not contact their plan prior to receiving services ; and ( 3 ) compare the rates at which beneficiaries in pffs plans disenroll to the rates for other ma plans and evaluate whether cms met statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries .
in addition , the increased payments allowed ma plans to expand into geographic areas where previously plan options had been very limited , resulting in more plan choices for beneficiaries .
nearly half of the recent growth in ma enrollment , about 45 percent , occurred in one type of plan — private fee - for - service ( pffs ) plans .
enrollment in these plans increased from about 35,000 beneficiaries in june 2004 to about 2.3 million beneficiaries in june 2008 .
