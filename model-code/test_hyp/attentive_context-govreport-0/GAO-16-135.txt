two federal agencies — the federal protective service ( fps ) , an agency within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and gsa — are critical to ensuring security .
we assessed ( 1 ) how the agencies' collaboration reflects key practices to ensure facility security and ( 2 ) the impact of their collaboration practices on day - to - day operations at the regional and facility levels .
fps and gsa headquarters officials should develop mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on their collaborative efforts to protect federal facilities in order to identify possible areas for improvement and to reinforce accountability .
over one - million employees and a wide range of visitors seeking services depend on the government to provide security and protection at approximately 8,900 facilities held or leased by the general services administration ( gsa ) .
the objectives of our report were to assess ( 1 ) how the agencies' collaboration reflects key practices to ensure facility security and ( 2 ) the impact of their collaboration practices on day - to - day operations at the regional and facility levels .
finally , we selected four fps and gsa regions for review of their collaborative efforts: region 3 ( mid - atlantic ) ; region 5 ( great lakes ) ; region 7 ( greater southwest ) ; and region 10 ( northwest / arctic ) .
additional interagency collaboration practices we did not select for our review include: ( 1 ) identify and address needs by leveraging resources and ( 2 ) reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts through performance management systems .
gsa also has responsibility for protecting federal facilities and their grounds and is also responsible for taking steps to improve efficiency while managing the government's real property portfolio and the physical structure of facilities .
to the extent that collaboration affects these agencies' ability to adequately protect facilities , security may be compromised .
the homeland security act of 2002 vested both the secretary of dhs and the administrator of gsa with responsibilities for the protection of these facilities .
for example , nppd's strategic plan does include two performance measures for fps ; gsa's strategic plan does not include any security - related performance measures .
without working to strengthen these key collaboration practices , fps and gsa risk their ability to meet their mission to adequately identify and address serious security risks .
fps is the component within dhs that has responsibility for security and protection of the facilities , their occupants , and visitors .
we found that these regional examples most closely relate to three of the six collaboration practices we included in our review: ( 1 ) agreeing on roles and responsibilities ; ( 2 ) establishing compatible policies and procedures ; and ( 3 ) developing mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results .
further , fps's and gsa's security - related performance measures , which allow agencies to track progress in achieving their goals , and to assist in monitoring and evaluating results , are limited .
given the collaboration challenges that fps and gsa face in protecting federal facilities , we are making four recommendations to the secretary of homeland security and the administrator of the general services administration .
