the foundation laid by the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and other management reform legislation provides a basis to improve the accountability of government programs and operations as well as to routinely produce valuable cost and operating performance information .
from a broad financial management perspective , the federal government's deteriorating long - range financial condition and long - term fiscal imbalance are matters of increasing concern .
while certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices continue to prevent gao from being able to issue an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government , the federal government has come a long way since enactment of the cfo act .
we face large and growing structural deficits due primarily to known demographic trends and rising health care costs .
this will be important as the federal government faces difficult fiscal challenges that will require reliable cost and performance information to support timely decisions on spending and , at the same time , pressures to address fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement will only intensify .
understanding and addressing the federal government's financial condition and long - term fiscal imbalance are critical to maintain fiscal flexibility so that we can respond to emerging social , economic , and security challenges .
at the same time , there is a continuing need to address persistent , long - standing accountability problems and to take financial management to the next level .
there is a need to engage in a fundamental review , reprioritization , and reengineering of the base of government .
your decision to begin this congress with a hearing on these important issues demonstrates the seriousness with which this subcommittee views the financial management challenges facing the federal government and your commitment to address them .
today i would like to: outline progress made to date and the key challenges in improving federal financial management practices , and highlight the challenges posed by the government's fiscal condition and my views on a possible way forward .
i am pleased to be here today to testify on the progress made towards a results - oriented , accountable , and relevant government and the challenges that must be addressed to provide accountability and exercise stewardship .
the federal government has made tremendous progress , and sustained congressional attention has been and will continue to be a critical factor to ensuring achievement of the goals and objectives of management reform legislation .
