while the mma assigned the majority of the responsibilities for implementing medicare part d prescription drug program to the department of health and human services and its centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , it charged the social security administration ( ssa ) with administering the low - income subsidy .
you asked us to review ( 1 ) the progress that ssa has made in identifying and soliciting applications from individuals potentially eligible for the low - income subsidy ; ( 2 ) the processes that ssa uses to make eligibility determinations , resolve appeals , and conduct redeterminations for the subsidy ; and ( 3 ) the impact that the subsidy had on ssa's workload and other operations .
to help the elderly and disabled with these costs , the congress passed the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act ( mma ) of 2003 , which created a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit ( medicare part d ) .
according to recent studies , such high costs may cause some elderly patients to forgo or restrict their use of prescription drugs .
this effort could also aid in developing more precise estimates of the eligible population and help to better inform the congress on legislative proposals to allow irs to share tax data with ssa to assist the agency with its outreach efforts .
high prescription drug costs can have a detrimental effect on low - income seniors and the disabled , who are more likely than others to suffer from chronic medical problems requiring prescription drugs .
a key element of the prescription drug benefit is the low - income subsidy , or “extra help,” available to medicare beneficiaries with limited incomes and resources to assist them in paying their premiums and other out - of - pockets costs .
in this capacity , ssa is responsible for conducting outreach efforts to identify and notify individuals of the availability of the subsidy , making subsidy eligibility determinations , resolving appeals , and conducting redeterminations of beneficiaries' continued subsidy eligibility .
the benefit , which became available in january 2006 , enables medicare beneficiaries to enroll in drug plans sponsored by private companies .
although no reliable data currently exist on the population of individuals who might qualify for the subsidy , ssa does not need such data to establish specific performance goals and measures to assess its outreach efforts .
without such goals and measures , ssa will not have a means to assess the effectiveness of its efforts , or to identify areas that require improvement as it moves forward .
ssa has made progress in approving individuals for the low - income subsidy , but has not established specific performance goals and measures for its outreach activities .
the extent of additional outreach efforts will also depend on ssa's ability to more precisely identify remaining individuals eligible for the subsidy .
having such goals and measures takes on heightened importance now since ssa is conducting outreach efforts on a more limited basis .
ssa is also responsible for withholding part d premiums from monthly social security benefits for beneficiaries who select this option .
to assess the social security administration's ( ssa ) implementation of the medicare part d low - income subsidy , we reviewed the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) to understand ssa's responsibilities under the law .
