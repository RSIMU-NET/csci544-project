the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has a primary mission to protect human health by safeguarding the natural environment — air , water , and land .
this report responds to your request that we ( 1 ) identify epa's efforts to close out inactive grants and contracts ; ( 2 ) identify the progress that epa has made in reducing the number of inactive grants and contracts , identify the number of remaining inactive grants and contracts , and identify the dates by which they are expected to be closed out ; and ( 3 ) determine the amount of unliquidated obligations for inactive grants and contracts .
epa carries out a large part of its mission by awarding grants and contracts to states , public and private entities , and other federal agencies .
more than 70 percent of epa's budget is used to award grants and contracts .
the agency's untimely grant closeout activities and insufficient oversight of nonconstruction grants were identified as material weaknesses in the agency's fiscal year 1997 integrity act report to the president and congress .
epa has developed several initiatives to reduce the number , or backlog , of inactive grants and contracts requiring closeout .
the timely closeout of inactive grants and contracts — those completed grants and contracts whose required time period for closeout has expired — is a long - standing management problem for epa .
once a grant or contract is completed or terminated and once the applicable budget or project period has expired , the agency must determine if the required work was completed and then close out the project , which includes making any final payments due the recipient .
the unliquidated funds from completed grants and contracts represent millions of dollars that potentially could be recovered , deobligated , and used to provide epa with additional resources needed to fund other environmental programs .
the timely closeout of grants and contracts is also an important financial management practice to ensure that the terms of the contracts and grants are accomplished .
one of the primary purposes of closing out grants and contracts is to ensure that any unliquidated obligated funds are recovered and used for environmental programs , as permitted by statute .
also identified as a separate material weakness was the untimely closeout of construction grants for wastewater treatment facilities .
government entities were provided with these grants to improve water quality .
in 1994 , epa's office of inspector general reported that a significant number of inactive contracts needed to be closed out .
epa has concentrated its efforts on superfund contracts and grants .
for other contracts and grants , headquarters policies encouraging regional and contracting offices to identify funds available for deobligation were not effective in the past until the agency made special efforts to reduce the backlogs .
we also analyzed epa's automated data files to identify the amount of unliquidated obligations for inactive grants and contracts .
to respond to these objectives , we reviewed documents , interviewed epa officials , and reviewed a random sample of grant and contract files .
during the past 6 years , epa has implemented several initiatives to address these backlogs and avert future ones .
while epa has devoted considerable effort and resources to these initiatives , the closeout requirements and strategies that it developed have not been consistently implemented .
