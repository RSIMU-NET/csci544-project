over the past few years , the department of defense ( dod ) has been interested in modernizing its forces with new weapons and equipment .
for a variety of reasons , these efforts have been stymied , and funds that dod expected to have available to modernize the force have been needed instead for current operational activities .
we have been assessing various air force activities to determine the feasibility of reducing operating costs .
in may 1996 , we reported that the air force's fighter force was not organized economically and recommended that the air force develop an implementation plan for operating its fighter force in larger , more cost - effective squadrons .
a few years ago , we evaluated whether the air force could operate its fighter forces more cost - effectively .
therefore , you have expressed an interest in reducing operating costs .
in making this assessment , we ( 1 ) evaluated the effect that reorganization may have on mission accomplishment , ( 2 ) determined whether costs could be reduced through redistributing aircraft among fewer wings , and ( 3 ) developed five possible options for redistributing c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft among fewer wings at lower operating costs .
for this follow - on effort , we assessed the cost - effectiveness of organizing the air force's airlift and refueling force into fewer , larger - sized squadrons and wings .
dod concurred with that recommendation .
this report focuses on the reserve component combat c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft .
seven states have both .
we developed five options for organizing reserve component c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft more cost - effectively into fewer , larger - sized squadrons .
for each option we developed , we assessed whether ( 1 ) the guard and reserve could recruit sufficient personnel to support additional aircraft and ( 2 ) sufficient existing locations had facilities that could be expanded to accommodate additional aircraft .
they rated their likely ability to increase personnel at all existing c - 130 and kc - 135 locations as ( 1 ) fully able to meet additional personnel requirements , ( 2 ) could meet personnel requirements with some difficulties , and ( 3 ) unlikely to meet additional requirements .
dod believes that it would be premature to develop a plan until congress acts on the department's proposal .
we also recognize that some options could have base closure and realignment implications , and that dod's authority in this area is subject to the requirements of 10 u.s.c .
all of the national guard kc - 135 wings could expand to at least 12 aircraft ( 3 already have more than 12 aircraft ) with one - time construction costs of no more than $6 million .
we also evaluated how three other issues could affect our options: one - time costs of redistributing the aircraft , the significance of the geographical location of the aircraft , and the effect that eliminating squadrons would have on states' abilities to respond to domestic crises .
also , some locations may require increased administrative and supply space .
in developing our options , we considered the two factors that reserve component officials cited as most important to successful reorganization: adequate recruiting potential and facility capacity .
