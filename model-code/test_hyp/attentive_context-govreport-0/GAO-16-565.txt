this report examines ( 1 ) the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) commitments that the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) has been asked to verify and monitor and its authorities to do so , ( 2 ) the resources iaea has identified as necessary to verify and monitor iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa , and ( 3 ) potential challenges and mitigating actions , if any , iaea and others have identified with regard to verifying iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa .
iran's past efforts to develop a nuclear weapons program threatened regional and global security and presented significant challenges to the united states .
the united states and other nations imposed sanctions on iran that adversely affected the iranian economy .
this report , which updates the preliminary findings in the interim report , examines ( 1 ) the jcpoa commitments that iaea has been asked to verify and monitor , and its authorities to do so ; ( 2 ) the resources iaea has identified as necessary to verify and monitor iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa ; and ( 3 ) potential challenges and mitigating actions , if any , iaea and others have identified with regard to verifying and monitoring iran's nuclear - related commitments under the jcpoa .
these challenges include ( 1 ) integrating the additional jcpoa - related funding needs that iaea has identified into the agency's regular budget , ( 2 ) managing human resources within the safeguards program , which could affect iaea's safeguards efforts internationally , and ( 3 ) addressing potential challenges with technical resources .
in july 2015 , multilateral talks with iran culminated in an agreement — the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) — in which the united states , france , germany , the united kingdom , russia , and china , with the high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , agreed to reciprocal commitments with iran .
these potential challenges include ( 1 ) detecting undeclared nuclear materials and activities , ( 2 ) accessing sites in iran , and ( 3 ) managing safeguards budgetary , human , and technical resources .
on july 20 , 2015 , the united nations security council endorsed the jcpoa and requested that the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) verify and monitor these commitments .
iaea also faces a potential human resource management challenge in its safeguards program as it implements actions to verify and monitor the jcpoa , which could affect its broader international safeguards mission .
the jcpoa details iran's commitments related to its nuclear facilities , equipment , materials , and activities , among other things .
iaea has previously found iran to be in noncompliance with its safeguards obligations .
detection of undeclared nuclear materials and activities is an inherent challenge for iaea ; iaea and member states have taken some steps to improve the agency's ability to detect undeclared activities .
iaea — an independent international organization based in vienna , austria , and affiliated with the united nations — has the dual mission of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and verifying that nuclear technologies and materials are used for peaceful purposes and not diverted to nuclear weapons .
