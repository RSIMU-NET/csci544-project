the reliability of contract disbursing data is critical to the department of defense ( dod ) for ( 1 ) properly accounting for and accurately making contract payments , ( 2 ) effectively accounting for and controlling billions of dollars in budget authority , and ( 3 ) preparing reliable financial information on the results of operations to support management and congressional decision making on programs , operations , and budget requests .
for example , defense finance and accounting service ( dfas ) columbus fiscal year 1999 data showed that almost $1 of every $3 in contract payment transactions in the mechanization of contract administration services ( mocas ) system was for adjustments to previously recorded payments — $51 billion of adjustments out of $157 billion in transactions .
we have previously reported on dod's inability to accurately account for and report on disbursements , which is a long - term problem that is pervasive and complex in nature .
however , dod has not yet completed its work to ( 1 ) provide information to the procuring activities on the correct methods for presenting payment instructions on contracts , ( 2 ) develop and implement standardized payment instructions to be used dod - wide , and ( 3 ) fully automate the payment process using these instructions .
you asked that we determine ( 1 ) the magnitude of adjustments that affected previously recorded payments and dfas columbus's reported cost to make these adjustments during fiscal year 2002 , ( 2 ) why contracts , including payment instructions , were so complex , ( 3 ) the key factors that caused dfas columbus to make payment adjustments for the two contracts that we reviewed in detail , and ( 4 ) what steps dod has taken or planned to address the adjustment problem .
until dod successfully modernizes its business operations , these interim steps will help avoid the inaccurate contract payment data that have hindered dod's ability to accurately account for and report on contract disbursements .
resolving dod's long - standing contract payment problems will require major improvements to its processes and systems .
one key element of dod's efforts to improve its business operations is its effort to develop an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain its ongoing and planned investments in business systems .
to determine the magnitude of adjustments that affected previously recorded payments and defense finance and accounting service ( dfas ) columbus's reported cost to make these adjustments in fiscal year 2002 , we obtained and analyzed a mechanization of contract administration services ( mocas ) database of contract payment transactions , including disbursements , collections , and adjustments , made for fiscal year 2002 .
thus , the two contracts — a $565 million army missile contract and a $49 million air force communications contract — are not representative of all dod contracts but , based on our experience , have characteristics similar to other complex contracts .
in its comments , dod concurred with two of the four recommendations and partially concurred with the remaining two recommendations .
the failure of dpps to become dod's standard procurement payment system is indicative of dod's long - standing inability to efficiently and effectively modernize its financial management and business systems .
