specifically , we discuss ( 1 ) current trends in medicare beneficiary enrollment in hmos , ( 2 ) flaws in medicare's rate - setting method preventing medicare from realizing potential savings from hmos , ( 3 ) strategies to enable medicare to realize hmo savings , and ( 4 ) the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) efforts to test hmo payment reforms .
in fact , medicare has paid health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) more for serving medicare beneficiaries than it would have spent , on average , had those same beneficiaries received care in the fee - for - service sector .
medicare has not yet harnessed the cost - saving potential of its managed care option .
proposals to reduce or even reverse these medicare losses have been discussed for roughly a decade .
lately , these proposals have received even more interest because of recent deficit reduction proposals aimed at slowing medicare spending growth by moving more beneficiaries into managed care .
as you requested , this report expands on our recent testimony before the committee on these issues .
our findings derive from examinations of medicare program data , reviews of the literature , interviews with industry experts , discussions with hcfa officials , and our previous reports on this subject .
a list of related gao products appears at the end of this report .
our work was performed from april to september of 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
in light of the increasingly urgent need to realize savings from the medicare hmo program and to develop viable new methods of paying hmos , congress may wish to consider giving the secretary of the department of health and human services authority to selectively reduce medicare hmo payment rates ( the aapcc rate ) in areas where market data indicate that the medicare rates are too high and expand hcfa's authority to mandate hmo participation in demonstration projects in order to conduct more meaningful studies of alternative payment methods .
consequently , hcfa needs to complement longer term improvements with quick action to mitigate medicare losses as risk contract hmo enrollment grows .
because these strategies are so far untried , the extent to which they would increase beneficiaries' price sensitivity and help control medicare costs is unknown .
although beneficiary enrollment in these hmos is relatively low , the program has grown dramatically in recent years in both beneficiary enrollment and hmo participation .
although the hmo share nationwide is small , recent hmo enrollment of medicare beneficiaries has grown rapidly .
these include strategies to encourage medicare enrollees to be more price sensitive .
hmo enrollment is further concentrated in urban areas .
as of may 1995 , about 2.6 million beneficiaries — about 7 percent of the total medicare population — were enrolled in the risk contract program.figure 1 shows that the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled is significantly higher than the national average in only a few states .
such strategies range from requiring newly eligible medicare beneficiaries who choose a fee - for - service plan to pay slightly more than beneficiaries who choose a managed care plan to approaches that would allow beneficiaries to “price shop” from a list of approved hmos and share a portion of any cost savings with the government .
