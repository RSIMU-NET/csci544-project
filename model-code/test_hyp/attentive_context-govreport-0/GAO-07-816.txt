for this study , we were asked to analyze ( 1 ) the major factors that have been identified as influencing the proportion of african american children entering and remaining in foster care compared to children of other races and ethnicities ; ( 2 ) the extent that states and localities have implemented strategies that appear promising in addressing african american representation in foster care ; and ( 3 ) the ways in which key federal child welfare policies may have influenced african american representation in foster care .
children of all races are equally as likely to suffer from abuse and neglect , according to the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) national incidence study of child abuse and neglect ( nis ) ; however , hhs data show that a significantly greater proportion of african american children enter and remain in foster care than children of other races and ethnicities .
african - american children across the nation were more than twice as likely to enter foster care compared with white children in 2004 , and african american children remained in foster care about 9 months longer .
concerned about why african american children are overrepresented in foster care , you asked us to analyze: ( 1 ) the major factors that have been identified as influencing the proportion of african american children entering and remaining in foster care compared to children of other races and ethnicities ; ( 2 ) the extent that states and localities have implemented strategies that appear promising in addressing african american representation in foster care ; and ( 3 ) the ways in which key federal child welfare policies may have influenced african american representation in foster care .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is the principal federal agency that provides federal oversight of states' child welfare systems .
although there is great variability among and within the states , data from nearly all states show some disproportionate representation of african american children in foster care .
to address these three objectives , we used multiple methodologies , including administering a state survey ; conducting site visits ; interviewing researchers and federal agency officials ; conducting a literature review ; and analyzing federal legislation and policies .
hhs should also encourage states to make increased use of hhs's national resource centers as a source of technical assistance on this issue .
on the last day of fiscal year 2004 , african american children totaled 162,911 — or 34 percent — of the 482,541 children in foster care , according to hhs data — about twice their proportions in the general child population .
hhs also administers social services block grant programs , such as temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , and states generally spend about $12 billion of these funds to provide direct social services .
states have the primary responsibility for establishing the legal and administrative structures and programs of their child welfare services ; however , federal legislation and regulations establish a framework within which states make their programmatic and fiscal decisions .
hhs administers about $8 billion in funds each year that are dedicated to support states' child welfare systems .
states use these block grant funds to benefit various populations , including child welfare families .
