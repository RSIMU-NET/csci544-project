our first report , issued on june 21 , 1996 , summarized reviews of the research literature on the effectiveness of treatment programs in reducing the recidivism of sex offenders .
our second report , issued on july 26 , 1996 , summarized reviews of the research literature on the effectiveness of education programs designed to help children avoid becoming victims of sexual abuse .
this is our third and final report responding to your request that we review and synthesize the current state of research knowledge on ways to prevent sex crimes against children .
this report summarizes the results of , and discusses the methodologies used in , the studies that have been done on the cycle of sexual abuse — that is , on the likelihood that individuals who were victims of sexual abuse as children will become sexual abusers of children in adulthood .
this report does not address a follow - on question that you raised concerning ways to prevent sexually abused children from becoming adult sexual offenders against children , because the existence of a cycle of sexual abuse was not established by the research studies we reviewed .
in addition , researchers choosing the prospective approach still face the challenge of disentangling the effects of sexual abuse from the effects of other possible problems and stress - related factors in the backgrounds of these children ( e.g. , poverty , unemployment , parental alcohol abuse , or other inadequate social and family functioning ) .
there are also questions about factors that may prevent victimized children from becoming adult perpetrators ( such as support from siblings and parents or positive relationships with other authority figures ) .
a prospective approach — selecting a sample of children who have been sexually abused and following them into adulthood to see whether they become sexual abusers — overcomes some of the problems of the retrospective approach , but it is a costly and time - consuming solution .
there remain many unanswered questions about the risk posed by early sexual victimization , as well as about the conditions and experiences that might increase this risk ( such as number of victimization experiences , age of the victim at the time of the abuse , and whether the abuse was perpetrated by a family member ) .
these difficulties include ( 1 ) the need to determine whether members of comparison groups were victims of sexual abuse , and ( 2 ) the need to employ more than a single outcome measure of offending .
answers to such questions would be useful in developing both prevention strategies and therapeutic interventions .
critics have argued that empirical support for the cycle of sexual abuse is weak , and that parents are unduly frightened into thinking that little can be done to mitigate the long - term effects of sexual abuse .
this requires the selection of appropriate comparison groups of children who have not been sexually abused and children who have faced other forms of maltreatment , as well as the careful measurement of a variety of other explanatory factors .
initial effects reportedly have included fear , anxiety , depression , anger , aggression , and sexually inappropriate behavior in at least some portion of the victim population .
