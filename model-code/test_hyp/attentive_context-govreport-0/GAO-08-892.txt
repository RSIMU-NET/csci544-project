our objectives were to ( 1 ) seek to determine how many a - 3 and g - 5 visa holders have alleged abuse by foreign diplomats with immunity since 2000 , ( 2 ) review the u.s. government's process for investigating abuse allegations involving foreign diplomats with immunity , and ( 3 ) describe and assess how state ensures correct and consistent implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa polices and procedures .
in june 2007 , the department of state ( state ) noted in its annual trafficking in persons report that some foreign diplomats may have abused individuals they had brought to the united states to work in their households .
this spot - check system would allow headquarters to assess compliance without dedicating the resources needed to review all a - 3 and g - 5 visas issued in a given year and could be targeted at posts that issue high numbers of a - 3 or g - 5 visas or that have identified difficulties interpreting guidance on these visas classes .
the department of homeland security ( homeland security ) investigates trafficking allegations and grants t visas to some trafficking victims .
the department of justice ( justice ) investigates trafficking allegations and prosecutes violations of criminal statutes .
state will also upgrade consular officers' access to tomis to provide improved information regarding a - 3 and g - 5 cases .
in response to your request , we ( 1 ) sought to determine how many a - 3 and g - 5 visa holders have alleged abuse by foreign diplomats with immunity since 2000 , ( 2 ) reviewed the u.s. government's process for investigating abuse allegations involving foreign diplomats with immunity , and ( 3 ) described and assessed how state ensures correct and consistent implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa policies and procedures .
we also analyzed various federal agencies' role in investigating and prosecuting federal law violations related to abuse of household workers by foreign diplomats with some level of immunity .
the department of labor ( labor ) investigates allegations of wage and hour violations .
to better ensure correct and consistent implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa policies and procedures , particularly those that outline requirements for employment contracts , we recommend that the secretary of state enhance oversight by establishing a system to spot - check compliance with these policies and procedures .
we analyzed state's roles and responsibilities related to a - 3 and g - 5 visa holders , as well as foreign diplomats , and identified key state offices and bureaus involved in these matters .
state grants a - 3 and g - 5 visas , issues guidance on diplomatic law , and maintains official records regarding the status and immunity level of foreign diplomats in the united states , among other things .
state again highlighted this problem in a july 2007 note to all chiefs of diplomatic missions in the united states , stating that it had recently learned of a number of allegations of trafficking in persons with respect to household workers , including allegations of involuntary servitude and physical abuse .
several u.s. government agencies are involved in efforts to respond to alleged abuse of these visa holders .
