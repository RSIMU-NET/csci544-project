after completing additional work , we plan to issue a report on the status of dod's actions on gao's previous recommendations , which will include any further recommendations needed to improve the department's implementation of dts and ensure its success in the future .
in december 1995 , the department of defense ( dod ) established the program management office — defense travel system ( pmo - dts ) to begin improving the department's travel operations by replacing existing travel systems with a single departmentwide system — dts .
this endeavor was in response to the 1995 dod travel reengineering report issued by the dod task force to reengineer travel that pinpointed the following three principal causes for the department's inefficient travel system: ( 1 ) travel policies and programs focused on compliance with rigid rules rather than mission performance , ( 2 ) travel practices that did not keep pace with travel management improvements implemented by industry , and ( 3 ) nonintegrated travel systems .
today , our testimony will focus on the actions dod has taken to implement previous gao recommendations regarding implementation of dts and related travel policies , phase out legacy travel systems and their associated costs , and implement electronic travel voucher processing .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our prior work and the preliminary results of our ongoing review of the defense travel system ( dts ) .
this body of work was undertaken in response to a joint request by your subcommittee and the subcommittee on readiness , house committee on armed services , and builds on prior gao reports .
in closing , we also would like to reiterate that following this testimony , we plan to issue a report on the status of dod's actions on gao's previous recommendations , which will include any further recommendations needed to improve the department's implementation of dts and ensure its success in the future .
to address the first objective , for those recommendations that department officials said were implemented , we analyzed specific documentation , such as test documentation , to assess whether we concurred with their assertions .
for the remaining recommendations , we identified specific actions the department had taken , or planned to take , and provided our perspective on whether those actions did or would respond to the recommendations and intent .
properly defined requirements are a key element in developing and implementing systems that meet their cost , schedule , and performance goals since requirements define the ( 1 ) functionality that is expected to be provided by the system and ( 2 ) quantitative measures by which to determine through testing whether that functionality is operating as expected .
our january 2006 and september 2006 reports contained 14 recommendations aimed at improving dod's management oversight and implementation of dts and related travel policies .
we have discussed the preliminary findings included in this testimony with dod officials .
we also met with officials from the defense travel management office ( dtmo ) , the pmo - dts , and the prime contractor , as appropriate , to obtain an understanding of the status of the recommendations .
however , based upon our work to date to validate dod's actions , we consider 7 of the 14 recommendations as closed and the remaining 7 open .
