from 1987 through 2003 , the united states provided more than $2 billion in economic assistance to the federated states of micronesia ( fsm ) and the rmi under a compact of free association ; approximately $579 million of this economic assistance went to the rmi .
the amended compact with the rmi identifies the additional 20 years of grant assistance as intended to assist the rmi government in its efforts to promote the economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance of its people .
in 2003 , the u.s. government approved an amended compact with the rmi that provides an additional 20 years of assistance , totaling about $1.5 billion from 2004 through 2023 .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss gao's recent work regarding the compact of free association between the united states and the republic of the marshall islands ( rmi ) .
the department of the interior's office of insular affairs ( oia ) is responsible for administering and monitoring this u.s. assistance .
these provisions include requiring the establishment of a joint economic management committee and a trust fund committee to , respectively , among other things , review the rmi's progress toward compact objectives and to assess the trust fund's effectiveness in contributing to the country's long - term economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance .
the assistance is provided in the form of annually decreasing grants that prioritize health and education , paired with annually increasing contributions to trust funds intended as a source of revenue for the country after the grants end in 2023 .
in 2003 , we testified that these provisions could improve accountability over assistance but that successful implementation will require appropriate resources and sustained commitment from both the united states and the rmi .
today , drawing on several reports that we have published since 2005 , i will discuss the rmi's economic prospects , implementation of its amended compact to meet long - term goals , and potential trust fund earnings .
the amended compact also contains several new funding and accountability provisions that strengthen reporting and bilateral interaction .
the compact provided a framework for the united states to work toward achieving its three main goals: ( 1 ) to secure self - government for the fsm and the rmi , ( 2 ) to ensure certain national security rights for all of the parties , and ( 3 ) to assist the fsm and the rmi in their efforts to advance economic development and self - sufficiency .
the rmi has taken steps to effectively implement compact assistance , but administrative challenges have hindered its ability to ensure use of the funds for its long - term development goals .
further , despite actions taken to effectively implement compact grants , administrative challenges have limited its ability to ensure use of the grants for its long - term goals .
largely dependent on government spending of foreign aid , the rmi has limited potential for private sector growth , and its government has made little progress in implementing reforms needed to increase investment opportunities and tax income .
however , data deficiencies , report shortcomings , capacity constraints , and inadequate communication have limited the rmi and u.s. governments' ability to consistently ensure the effective use of grant funds to measure progress , and monitor day - to - day activities .
