to provide the public with information about the social security program , the congress enacted a law that requires the social security administration ( ssa ) to provide to individuals regular statements that estimate the benefits they may receive through the program .
in light of this proposal , you asked us to look at ( 1 ) the general implications of using a rate of return for social security and ( 2 ) the challenges of including this information on the pebes .
recently , in the course of the debate regarding how to restore long - term solvency for the social security program , legislation has been proposed that would require ssa to place on the pebes an individualized estimate of the rates of return workers receive on their contributions to the social security program .
the purpose of the proposal is , in part , to provide information that would enable workers to compare the current social security program with other investments , including alternatives being discussed in the reform debate .
in 1995 , ssa began sending personal earnings and benefit estimate statements ( pebes ) automatically to workers who had reached age 60 .
these six - page statements provide workers with a list of their yearly earnings on record at ssa , information about their eligibility for benefits , and estimates of these benefits .
starting in fiscal year 2000 , the pebes will be sent annually to almost every u.s. worker aged 25 and older â€” an estimated 123 million people each year .
to respond to your request , we relied on our ongoing work on calculating and using rates of return , which includes an extensive review of the literature on this issue , and our prior work on the usefulness of the pebes .
in our ongoing work on rates of return , we will more fully address the extent to which social security and private market rates of return can be compared .
 ( the 1998 pebes is reprinted in app .
ensuring long - term solvency within the current program structure will require either increasing revenues or reducing expenditures , or some combination of both .
analysts disagree about whether it is appropriate to use rates of return to evaluate the social security program and the options for reform .
as a result of the financial problems facing the program , a national debate on how to ensure social security's solvency has begun and will likely intensify .
in addition , we obtained relevant information from ssa officials and other experts .
we conducted our work in june and july 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
proponents of adding rates of return to the pebes believe these rates would provide individuals with information on the current program and enable them to compare their rate of return for social security with rates for other investments .
however , it has already been difficult to develop a pebes that provides readily understandable information on the existing programs and benefits alone .
for example , the social security program is designed to help ensure that low - wage earners have adequate income in their retirement .
adding rate of return information could significantly increase the statement's length and undermine ssa's current efforts to shorten and simplify it .
