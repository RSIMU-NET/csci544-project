this longevity and growth built on the efforts of the committee on oversight and government reform ( then the committee on government operations ) in spearheading their origination , beginning in 1976 .
there are two types of inspectors general ( igs ) : ( 1 ) federal establishment igs are appointed by the president with senate confirmation , and may be removed only by the president except in the case of impeachment ; and ( 2 ) designated federal entity ( dfe ) igs are appointed and removed by the agency head in usually smaller agencies .
substantial bipartisan and bicameral support was necessary at their creation , given the across - the - board opposition by executive agencies early on , and for their continued development .
the inspector general act , as amended , will reach its 30 th anniversary in 2008 , and today there are more than 60 offices of inspectors general ( oigs ) .
some of these purposes and powers of the igs include their charges to conduct and supervise audits and investigations within an agency ; provide leadership and coordination for recommending policies and activities to promote the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of programs and operations ; have access to agency information and files and subpoena power for records and documents ; receive complaints from agency employees whose identities are to remain confidential ( with certain stated exceptions ) ; implement the cash incentive award program for employee disclosures of waste , fraud , and abuse ; hold independent law enforcement authority in offices in establishments ; receive a separate appropriations account for offices in establishments ; be appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in relevant professions ( for establishment igs and the ig for the u.s .
postal service ) ; remain in office without term or tenure limits ; report suspected violations of federal criminal law immediately and directly to the attorney general ; and operate under only the "general supervision" of the agency head , who is prohibited ( with only a few express exceptions ) from preventing or prohibiting an ig from initiating or carrying out an audit or investigation .
in combating waste , fraud , and abuse , igs have been granted a substantial amount of independence , authority , and resources .
the resulting connections between the igs and congress not only enhance legislative oversight capabilities , but also provide an avenue for potential support for ig findings , conclusions , and recommendations for corrective action .
despite their institutional arrangements and authorities , modifications to the ig act have been seen as useful to enhance the ig's independence and power .
the establishing mandates and statutory supports for the igs provide a useful vantage point to view the current proposals to modify the igs , their statutory powers and political power .
in combination , these assets are probably greater than those held by any similar internal auditing - investigating office at any level of government , here or abroad , now or in the past .
along with these , igs have critical reporting requirements to keep the agency head and congress "fully and currently informed" through specified reports and otherwise ( which includes testifying at hearings and meeting with members and staff ) .
