this report ( 1 ) identifies steps taken by the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the department of treasury ( treasury ) to establish government - wide data element definitions and the extent to which those definitions are consistent with leading practices or face challenges that could affect data quality ; ( 2 ) reviews efforts by omb and treasury to provide agencies with technical implementation guidance to standardize how data are collected and reported and related challenges ; and ( 3 ) examines the status of selected federal agencies' progress in meeting data act requirements .
to improve the transparency and quality of the federal spending data made available to the public , the data act directs the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the department of the treasury ( treasury ) to establish government - wide data standards that include common data elements for reporting financial and payment information by may 2015 .
the digital accountability and transparency act of 2014 ( data act ) holds considerable promise for shedding more light on how federal funds are spent .
this report ( 1 ) identifies steps taken by omb and treasury to establish government - wide data element definitions and the extent to which those definitions are consistent with leading practices or face challenges that could affect data quality ; ( 2 ) reviews efforts by omb and treasury to provide agencies with technical implementation guidance to standardize how data are collected and reported and related challenges ; and ( 3 ) examines the status of selected federal agencies' progress in meeting data act requirements .
to address these problems , we recommended that the director of omb ( 1 ) clarify guidance on reporting award information and maintaining supporting records and ( 2 ) develop and implement oversight processes to ensure that awards data are consistent with agency records .
it is critical that agencies use government - wide standards to report spending data in order to help ensure the quality and usefulness of the resulting information .
we identified these agencies using a three - step selection process that considered ( 1 ) whether the agency was in compliance with existing federal requirements for federal financial management systems ; ( 2 ) the type of federal funding provided ( such as grants , loans , and contracts ) ; and ( 3 ) status as a federal shared service provider for financial management .
the federal government spends more than $3.5 trillion annually ; however , tracking this money can be difficult because spending data are often incomplete or inaccurate .
in order to fully and effectively implement the data act , the federal government will need to address complex policy and technical issues .
this report is the latest gao work in response to a statutory provision to review data act implementation .
omb required the plans to include: ( 1 ) a timeline of tasks and steps toward implementing the requirements of this guidance ; ( 2 ) an estimate of costs to implement these tasks and steps ; ( 3 ) a detailed narrative that explains the required steps , identifies the underlying assumptions , and outlines the potential difficulties and risks to successfully implement the plan ; and ( 4 ) a detailed project plan that agencies will develop over time .
