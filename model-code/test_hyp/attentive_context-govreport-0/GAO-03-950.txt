the food and drug administration ( fda ) , the federal agency that approves drugs for marketing , is responsible for administering the law and has procedures for ensuring the study of drugs in pediatric patients .
a drug used to treat children that has not been tested or labeled for pediatric use may place children at risk of under - or overdosing , and when age - appropriate formulations of the drugs do not exist , such as liquids or chewable tablets , the drug may be improperly administered to children .
to help address these concerns , in 1997 congress passed a law that gives sponsors 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights for their products in return for conducting clinical drug studies in children , commonly known as the pediatric exclusivity provision .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we addressed the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent are children of racial and ethnic minority groups represented in clinical studies for drugs granted exclusive marketing rights , ( 2 ) are drugs that are used to treat diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups being studied for safety and effectiveness in children under the pediatric exclusivity provision , and ( 3 ) does fda have appropriate management systems to monitor the representation of children of racial and ethnic groups in studies submitted for additional exclusive marketing rights ? .
while children can be stricken with many of the same diseases afflicting adults and are often treated with the same drugs , only about one - third of drugs in use today have been studied and labeled for pediatric use .
fda officials are concerned that drug effectiveness and adverse effects can vary among children from different racial and ethnic groups .
specifically , if fda officials believe that studying a drug may lead to health benefits for children , fda issues a formal “written request” for clinical drug studies in pediatric patients to the drug sponsor .
pediatric drug research has increased substantially since the enactment of the pediatric exclusivity provision .
although fda has requested race and ethnicity data on subjects in clinical drug trials , no formal evaluations have assessed the extent to which children of different racial and ethnic groups are represented in clinical studies of new drugs , thus the extent to which these drugs have been tested on children in minority groups is unknown .
to ensure that children of racial and ethnic minority groups are included in clinical studies for new drugs , the best pharmaceuticals for children act of 2002 ( bpca ) expanded the pediatric exclusivity provision to require , among other things , that fda “take into account adequate representation” of children from racial and ethnic minority groups when negotiating written protocols with the study sponsors of pediatric drugs .
concern exists that if children from racial and ethnic minority groups are not included in adequate numbers in clinical studies of drugs , the administration of the drugs to children in these groups may result in atypical responses or unexpected side effects .
if the sponsor agrees to comply with the terms of the written request and submits final study results to fda that meet the terms of the request , fda will grant the sponsor 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights .
