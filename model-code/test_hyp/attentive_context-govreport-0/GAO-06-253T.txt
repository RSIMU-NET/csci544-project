i am pleased to be here today to discuss the social security administration's ( ssa ) procedures for issuing social security numbers ( ssns ) and benefits to foreign - born individuals .
in 2004 , an estimated 35.7 million foreign - born people resided in the united states , and many legitimately have ssns .
second , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible to receive social security benefits ? .
in light of concern that foreign - born individuals may have been given ssns inappropriately as well as recent legislation that changes how ssa assigns numbers and awards benefits for foreign - born individuals , you asked us to address two questions .
first , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for an ssn ? .
in both reports gao found that ssa was undertaking improvements in its procedures for issuing ssns and benefits to the foreign - born , but that ssa nonetheless remained vulnerable to errors and fraud .
in february of 2005 , we reported on ssa's ability to develop and manage agreements with other nations to avoid duplicating social security and other taxes and benefits for workers who have been employed both in the u.s. and in another country , commonly known as totalization agreements .
for example , in 2003 we reported on ssa's issuance of ssns to foreign - born noncitizens .
gao has over the past few years studied several issues related to these topics .
congress and ssa have also improved laws and procedures designed to strengthen program integrity in the payment of benefits to the foreign - born .
some foreign - born individuals are eligible for one of three kinds of social security cards depending in part on their immigration status: ( 1 ) regular cards , ( 2 ) those valid for work only with authorization from the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and ( 3 ) those that are not valid for work â€” nonwork cards .
due to provisions of the social security protection act of 2004 , some foreign - born individuals who were not authorized to work will no longer be eligible for benefits .
congress has enacted recent legislation strengthening the ssn enumeration process and documentation requirements .
amendments to the social security act in 1996 require individuals to be lawfully present in the u.s. to receive social security benefits , though some noncitizens can receive benefits while living abroad , such as noncitizens who have worked in the u.s. and in a country with which the u.s. has a totalization agreement .
the agreements help eliminate dual taxation and social security coverage that multinational employers and employees encounter when workers temporarily reside in a foreign country with its own social security program .
ssa is implementing the law and is improving document verification and now requires third - party verification of noncitizen documents such as birth certificates and visual inspection of documents before issuing an ssn .
ssa's totalization agreements coordinate taxation and public pension benefits .
both ssa's inspector general and gao have identified weaknesses in ssa procedures for assigning ssns and issuing cards , also known as enumeration .
ssa also continues to strengthen program integrity by , for example , restricting the number of replacement cards it issues .
