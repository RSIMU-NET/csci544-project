since then , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has issued regulations for more than 90 contaminants , and all states ( except wyoming ) have assumed primary responsibility for administering the federal drinking water program and overseeing public water system compliance .
the quality of water delivered by public water systems has been regulated at the federal level since enactment of the 1974 safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) .
among the key provisions , the 1996 amendments authorized a drinking water state revolving fund ( dwsrf ) program to help public water systems finance improvements needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and to address the most serious risks to human health .
congress last broadly amended the law in 1996 ( p.l .
the law authorizes epa to make grants to states each year to capitalize a state revolving loan fund .
states are authorized to use dwsrf funds to provide financial assistance ( primarily subsidized loans ) to eligible public water systems for expenditures that epa has determined , through guidance , will facilitate sdwa compliance or significantly further the act's health protection objectives .
each state must match 20% of its annual capitalization grant .
104-182 ) in response to criticism that the statute had too little flexibility , too many unfunded mandates , and an arduous but unfocused regulatory schedule .
the federal grants and state match — combined with funds from loan repayments , leveraged bonds , and other sources — are intended to generate an ongoing source of water infrastructure funding over time .
the dwsrf program is patterned after the clean water act state revolving fund ( cwsrf ) program that congress authorized in 1987 for financing municipal wastewater treatment projects .
public water systems eligible to receive dwsrf assistance include roughly 50,000 community water systems ( whether publicly or privately owned ) and 17,500 not - for - profit noncommunity water systems .
projects to consolidate water supplies and enhance water system security may also be eligible .
more specifically , the law directs each state to develop an intended use plan each year indicating how the allotted funds will be used and requires states to give funding priority to projects that address the most serious human health risks , are necessary to ensure compliance , and assist systems most in need on a per - household basis according to state affordability criteria .
states generally may not provide dwsrf assistance to systems that lack the capacity to ensure compliance with the act or are in significant noncompliance with sdwa requirements unless these systems meet certain conditions to return to compliance .
projects to replace aging infrastructure are eligible if they are needed to maintain compliance or to further health protection goals .
although the law authorizes assistance to privately owned community water systems , some states have laws or policies that preclude privately owned utilities from receiving dwsrf assistance .
systems owned by federal agencies are not eligible .
projects eligible for dwsrf assistance include installation and replacement of treatment facilities , distribution systems , and certain storage facilities .
they may not be used to pay for operation and maintenance activities or for projects needed primarily to accommodate growth .
