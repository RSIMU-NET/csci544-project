demands on available water supplies have heightened local and regional water - use conflicts throughout the country , particularly in the west and southeast .
the 116 th congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorizations and appropriations legislation related to water resource development , management , and protection .
development pressures , droughts and floods , and concerns about changing hydrology fro m land - use change and climate change engender nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects .
there is interest in new water resource infrastructure ( e.g. , storm surge gates , water storage ) and new kinds of projects ( e.g. , groundwater recharge projects , nature - based flood risk reduction ) .
in addition , there is interest in reinvestment in aging water resource infrastructure and in improved management of available supplies through water science , monitoring , and operational changes .
congress principally has directed either the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) in the department of the interior ( doi ) or the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) in the department of defense to plan and construct the existing stock of large federal water resource projects .
water resource policy questions relevant to the 116 th congress include the following: what will be the federal role in maintaining the performance and safety of existing water resource infrastructure ? .
doi's u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) has a prominent role in federal water resource science and observation ( e.g. , streamgages , groundwater information , and other water resource data ) .
in addition , congress authorizes and funds selected water resource science and monitoring activities at multiple federal agencies .
congress historically has played a role in water resources through authorization of and appropriations for regional and site - specific projects and activities .
the report next covers the following crosscutting topics: funding and financing aging and new water resource projects , changing from federal infrastructure projects to federal partnerships , protecting and restoring the environment , flood resilience and natural and nature - based infrastructure , and recharging groundwater .
in addition to usace , reclamation , and usgs , other federal agencies have water - related programs and activities ; these other agencies are largely beyond the scope of this report .
some of the projects are for facilitating navigation and expanding water supplies for irrigation and other uses .
this report also does not address municipal water systems , municipal wastewater infrastructure , or environmental protections , such as water quality and wetlands regulations .
other projects are aimed at reducing flood and drought losses and restoring aquatic ecosystems .
usace constructs projects nationwide that primarily seek to improve navigation , reduce flood damages , and restore aquatic ecosystems .
under what conditions and how should the federal government be involved in planning and constructing water resource projects ? .
this report first discusses some broad categories of water resource topics relevant to the 116 th congress â€” projects and activities of usace , western water and reclamation , indian water rights settlements , international waters shared with canada and mexico , and water resource science at usgs .
historically , reclamation constructed projects in the 17 arid states west of the mississippi river ; these projects were designed principally to provide reliable supplies of water for irrigation and some municipal and industrial uses .
