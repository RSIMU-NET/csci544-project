 ( recommendation 4 ) .
according to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , more than 300,000 indians — roughly 12 percent of the approximate total indian population of the united states — live within 3 miles of a site that has released or may release a hazardous substance .
additionally , data on sites that have nai are not accurate or complete due , in part , to unclear guidance for how regions should determine whether a site has nai .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the director of epa's office of superfund remediation and technology innovation should clarify agency guidance regarding tribal consultation for the superfund program to clearly identify the circumstances under which the agency should consider consulting with tribes .
this report ( 1 ) examines the extent to which epa has reliable data identifying npl sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , ( 2 ) examines the extent to which epa has reliable data on the agency's consultation with tribes regarding npl sites , and ( 3 ) describes what actions , if any , epa has taken to address the unique needs of tribes when making decisions about cleanup actions at npl sites .
although epa has documented guidance , it is not clear about how epa officials should make determinations about designating sites as having nai .
we are making the following four recommendations to epa: the director of epa's office of superfund remediation and technology innovation should develop a regular review process to ensure the quality of sems data identifying npl sites on tribal property and revise automated reports used to check the accuracy of sems data to include on tribal property data .
releases of hazardous substances into the environment can create significant risks to human health and the environment , and indian tribes can face unique challenges associated with exposure to such substances .
to examine the extent to which epa has reliable data identifying npl sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , we obtained epa data on npl sites currently proposed , final , or deleted , that ( 1 ) epa data indicate are associated with indian tribes , ( 2 ) the agency has determined to have native american interest ( nai ) , and ( 3 ) epa officials told us may be within 10 miles of tribal property .
epa policies and guidance epa policy for the administration of environmental programs on indian reservations ( 1984 ) .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the assistant administrator of epa's office of land and emergency management should clarify guidance to regional offices on how to determine whether sites have nai , including by adding criteria for when a site should be designated as having nai in the sems database and how , if at all , to adjust sems data if a tribe is no longer interested in a site .
this appendix provides information on the site - wide cleanup status of national priorities list ( npl ) sites with known native american interest ( nai ) , as of december 2017 .
without developing such a review process , epa will not have reasonable assurance that regional officials have accurately identified the sites that are on tribal property .
