this report addresses ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to review records that are maintained in its databases to identify potential overstays , ( 2 ) the extent to which dhs's changes in its systems or processes have improved data on potential overstays and dhs's ability to report overstay rates , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dhs has made progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system .
to provide reasonable assurance of when dhs will be able provide an assessment of the benefits and costs of biometric air exit options to congress , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security establish time frames and milestones for developing and implementing an evaluation framework to be used in conducting the department's assessment of biometric air exit options .
to help improve confidence in the quality of overstay data that dhs plans to report in december 2013 in accordance with statutory reporting requirements , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct relevant dhs components to assess and document the extent to which the reliability of the data used to develop any overstay estimates has improved and any remaining limitations in how the data can be used .
however , overstays could pose homeland security the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has primary responsibility for identifying and taking enforcement action to address overstays .
u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is the lead agency for enforcing immigration law in the interior of the united states and is primarily responsible for overstay enforcement .
furthermore , any delays in providing this information to congress could further affect possible implementation of a biometric exit system to address statutory requirements .
in addition to taking actions in response to the recommendations we have made , since april 2011 , dhs has reported taking other actions to strengthen its processes for identifying and taking enforcement action against overstays , such as enhancing its use of biographic data to identify overstays and developing plans to capture biometric data as part of departure records to comply with federal law .
within dhs , u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is tasked with , among other duties , inspecting all people applying for entry to the united states to determine their admissibility to the country and screening visa waiver program applicants to determine their eligibility to travel to the united states under the program .
dhs plans to provide congress with an assessment of the benefits and costs of various options for pursuing a biometric exit system at airports , but without robust planning that includes time frames and milestones to develop and implement an evaluation framework for this assessment , dhs lacks reasonable assurance that it will be able to provide this assessment to congress for the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle as planned .
regarding our second recommendation , that dhs establish time frames and milestones for developing and implementing an evaluation framework to be used in conducting the department's assessment of biometric air exit options , dhs indicated that cbp and s&t will finalize the goals and objectives for biometric air exit by january 31 , 2014 , and that these goals and objectives will be used in the development of an evaluation framework that dhs expects to have completed by june 30 , 2014 .
