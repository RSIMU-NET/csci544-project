with a budget of about $42.5 million , cpsc carries out its mission by ( 1 ) enforcing federal consumer product regulations ( by recalling products from store shelves , for example ) and ( 2 ) conducting projects to address products with potential hazards not covered by existing regulations .
specifically , this report ( 1 ) identifies the criteria cpsc uses to select projects and reviews the information it relies upon in making these choices , ( 2 ) assesses the information cpsc draws on to perform risk assessment and cost - benefit analyses and evaluates the agency's methodology for conducting cost - benefit analyses , and ( 3 ) describes cpsc's procedures for releasing manufacturer - specific information to the public and reports whether evidence exists that cpsc violated its statutory requirements concerning the release of such information .
contending that the agency is ineffectively allocating its resources , cpsc's critics have voiced dissatisfaction with the selection of certain agency projects and have questioned the validity of cpsc's risk assessment and cost - benefit analyses supporting those projects .
for example , cpsc would be better able to make informed decisions on potential agency projects if it had additional statistically reliable and timely data in several areas , including ( 1 ) injuries treated outside of hospital emergency rooms ; ( 2 ) exposure to consumer products and product - related hazards ; ( 3 ) chronic illnesses related to consumer products ; and ( 4 ) hazards that disproportionately affect certain vulnerable populations , such as low - income individuals and consumers with disabilities .
these projects may result in cpsc issuing new regulations concerning specific products , assisting in the development of voluntary industry standards , or providing information to consumers about how to use the products safely .
we concluded that cpsc's death and injury data are generally insufficient to support the agency's project selection process for two reasons: ( 1 ) cpsc has little or no data on several project selection criteria and ( 2 ) cpsc's data on its other project selection criteria exhibit significant gaps .
created to protect consumers from “unreasonable risk of injury,” the u.s. consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) oversees these and about 15,000 other consumer products ranging from kitchen appliances and children's toys to hot tubs and garage door openers .
we included not only major regulatory efforts but also smaller - scale projects .
they stated that cpsc's actions are based on solid injury and death estimates and that cpsc ( 1 ) employs sound economic analyses that are appropriate for the circumstances , ( 2 ) tracks projects to monitor the progress of its work , and ( 3 ) has been successful in dramatically reducing the threat to consumers from unsafe products .
cpsc has wide latitude over which potential product hazards it targets for regulatory and nonregulatory action .
the lack of comprehensive data on individual product hazards and on agency initiatives raises questions about cpsc's ability to evaluate its own effectiveness — which it is now required to do under the government performance and results act of 1993 ( the results act ) .
without these improved data , cpsc will remain unable to accurately apply measurable criteria in choosing projects or to rigorously assess relative risks among potential hazards .
