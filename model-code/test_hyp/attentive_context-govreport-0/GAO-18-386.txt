to assist providers , ocr has worked with onc to develop a model notice of privacy practices to help providers adequately communicate access rights to patients in a standardized , easy - to - understand way .
we assessed the reliability of these data by ( 1 ) performing electronic testing of required data elements , ( 2 ) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them , and ( 3 ) consulting agency officials who are knowledgeable about the data .
we conducted interviews with relevant stakeholders , including representatives from seven release - of - information ( roi ) vendors and nine individuals or entities with expertise in hipaa , including hipaa lawyers in both private practice and who work in health policy .
ocr ( 1 ) investigates complaints it receives from patients and others regarding access to patient medical records , ( 2 ) audits a sample of providers to determine the extent to which their policies and procedures are compliant with hipaa , ( 3 ) reports to congress on compliance with hipaa , and ( 4 ) educates patients and providers about patients' rights to access their medical records .
we also interviewed officials from hhs's ocr , office of the national coordinator for health information technology ( onc ) , and office of inspector general ( oig ) .
in 2016 , the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office for civil rights ( ocr ) , which is responsible for enforcing the rights established under hipaa , issued guidance about the right of access .
