because of a concern about the extent of erroneous eic claims , the congress included provisions in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 ( tra97 ) that led to the internal revenue service's ( irs ) establishment of a compliance effort known as the eic recertification program .
the earned income credit ( eic ) is a refundable tax credit available to low - income , working taxpayers .
our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) irs's communications with taxpayers about recertification meet the needs of irs and taxpayers , ( 2 ) information taxpayers are told to provide to prove their entitlement to the eic is reasonably easy to obtain and consistent with what irs examiners accept in making recertification decisions , and ( 3 ) examiners are consistent in how they assess supporting documentation provided by taxpayers .
from january through december 2001 , according to irs , about $31 billion was paid to about 19.0 million eic claimants .
while it is important to ensure that all persons eligible for the eic receive it , equally important is the need to identify and deny erroneous claims , whether due to fraud , negligence , or confusion .
because of the need to strike an appropriate balance between compliance and taxpayer burden , you asked us to assess the eic recertification program .
under the program , taxpayers who have been disallowed the eic through an irs audit are to substantiate their qualification for the eic before irs recertifies them to receive the credit again .
our assessment of the recertification program included analyses of irs forms , correspondence , and guidance related to recertification ; interviews of irs examiners who worked on recertification cases ; and interviews of representatives from organizations who provide assistance to low - income taxpayers in controversies with irs .
most relevant to this report , ( 1 ) the definitions of qualifying child and eligible foster child for eic purposes have changed and ( 2 ) starting with tax returns filed in 2001 , irs , as authorized by tra97 , began imposing a 2-year ban on credits to taxpayers who it determines negligently claimed the eic through reckless or intentional disregard of the regulations .
although our assessment was directed at the eic recertification program , many of our findings would also apply to other irs enforcement efforts involving eic claims .
these procedures generally involve examiners ( 1 ) asking taxpayers to provide support , ( 2 ) reviewing any support provided , and ( 3 ) advising taxpayers of the audit results .
many of these changes were in response to recommendations resulting from prior reviews by us and the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) .
there have also been some significant program developments since 1998 .
ii for information on prior recommendations by us and tigta and irs's corrective actions. ) .
since july 1999 , we and the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) have reported several concerns about the eic recertification program and have made several recommendations .
irs examiners are to select the return for audit unless the taxpayer is no longer claiming the eic child ( ren ) previously disallowed and is not claiming a new eic child .
