title i , part a , of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) authorizes federal aid to local educational agencies ( leas ) for the education of disadvantaged children .
title i - a is the largest federal elementary and secondary education assistance program , with services provided to ( 1 ) more than 90% of all leas ; ( 2 ) approximately 52,000 ( 54% of all ) public schools ; and ( 3 ) approximately 16.5 million ( 34% of all ) pupils , including approximately 188,000 pupils attending private schools .
these include requirements for assessments of pupil achievement ; adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) standards and determinations for schools , leas , and states ; consequences for schools and leas that fail to make ayp for two consecutive years or more ; plus teacher and paraprofessional qualifications .
another crs report ( crs report rl33731 , education for the disadvantaged: reauthorization issues for esea title i - a under the no child left behind act , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] ) discusses issues related to the accountability and other policies of esea title i - a .
title i - a grants provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other pupils attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from low - income families .
this report provides: ( a ) descriptions of the esea title i - a allocation formulas ; ( b ) a review of recent funding trends for title i - a ; and ( c ) analyses of major issues related to the title i - a allocation formulas , divided into general categories of broad issues directly affecting all regions of the nation and issues that directly affect only a limited number of states or local educational agencies .
in recent years , they have also become a "vehicle" to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public k - 12 education for all pupils have been attached as a condition for receiving title i - a grants .
currently , although the authorization for esea title i - a has expired , appropriations have continued to be provided , and the program continues to be implemented under the policies established by the most recent authorization statute .
those interested in a more concise description of the esea title i - a allocation formulas and review of reauthorization issues related to them than found in this report should refer to the final section of that report ( rl33731 ) .
these formulas are used to allocate funds not only under the largest federal k - 12 education program , but also several other esea and non - esea programs under which grants are made in proportion to esea title i - a allocations .
the focus of this report is on the formulas used to allocate title i - a funds to states , leas , and schools .
at best , it is a crude and indirect measure of variations in the costs of providing public k - 12 education .
the 111 th congress is expected to consider proposals to extend and amend the esea .
