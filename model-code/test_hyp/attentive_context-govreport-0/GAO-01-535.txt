the six programs and associated agencies were the ( 1 ) health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) medicare program ; ( 2 ) department of agriculture's food stamp program ; ( 3 ) social security administration's ( ssa ) old age , survivors , and disability insurance ( oasdi ) program ; ( 4 ) ssa's supplemental security income ( ssi ) program ; ( 5 ) u.s. customs service's compliance measurement program ( cmp ) ; and ( 6 ) immigration and naturalization service's ( ins ) inspections' traveler examinations ( intex ) pilot program .
the internal revenue service ( irs ) reviews all tax returns after they are filed to ensure compliance with the tax laws governing this voluntary system .
in order to understand the overall extent of noncompliance and the effectiveness of its compliance assurance programs , irs has periodically measured voluntary compliance .
there are three types of voluntary compliance measures: filing compliance , which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner ; payment compliance , which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner ; and reporting compliance , which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns .
in spite of irs' efforts to enforce compliance , each year billions of dollars in taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid , which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs , higher tax rates , or both .
the u.s. tax system is based on voluntary reporting â€” taxpayers self - report their liabilities on the returns they file .
however , the commissioner of internal revenue has said that a current measure of voluntary compliance is needed to assess how well irs is accomplishing its mission .
these reviews include the math error program , matching of information returns to tax returns and operational audits .
in light of the controversy surrounding irs' last effort to measure voluntary reporting compliance by randomly auditing taxpayers , we initiated this review to determine the status of irs' current efforts .
operational audits are targeted on returns where irs suspects noncompliance , often based on a computerized screening of returns that looks for indicators of noncompliance .
to determine the status of irs' plans to measure voluntary reporting compliance , we reviewed available planning documents and discussed the plans with irs officials .
irs does not have a current measure of voluntary reporting compliance .
we initiated this assignment as part of our effort to monitor irs' activities related to its reorganization , implementation of its new strategic goals , and development of measures to assess its progress in meeting these goals .
in addition , we looked at how selected programs in other federal agencies use random sampling to measure compliance with the rules and regulations governing their programs .
unlike operational audits , done to help ensure compliance and targeted on suspected noncompliance , random audits are done to measure compliance and are conducted on a sample of returns selected without regard to suspected noncompliance .
also , we wanted to explore how other agencies assessed compliance with their rules and regulations and measured progress against their strategic goals .
