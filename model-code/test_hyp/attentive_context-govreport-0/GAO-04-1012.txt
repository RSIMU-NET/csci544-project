we were asked to provide information on ( 1 ) how key provisions of the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) reform act have affected program services , ( 2 ) what have been the challenges in implementing the taa reform act's new provisions , ( 3 ) whether demand for taa training has changed , and how states are meeting this demand , and ( 4 ) what is known about what the taa program is achieving .
in light of recent changes to the program , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) how key provisions of the taa reform act have affected program services , ( 2 ) what have been the challenges in implementing the taa reform act's new provisions , ( 3 ) whether demand for taa training has changed , and how states are meeting this demand , and ( 4 ) what is known about what the taa program is achieving .
in particular , labor should track over time the following: the ability of workers to meet the new training enrollment deadline and of states and local areas to provide appropriate assessments to all trade - affected workers within the deadline , especially when responding to very large layoffs , and whether the eligibility criteria for the new wage insurance program are resulting in the denial of services to some older workers who could benefit from the program .
partly in response to these concerns , congress passed the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) reform act of 2002 .
economists generally agree that international trade has benefited americans in a number of ways , for example , through making a broader range of goods and services available .
the primary program for workers dislocated from manufacturing because of international trade is the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) program , established in 1962 and currently funded at about $1.3 billion annually .
among the changes , the act shortened from 60 days to 40 days the time labor is given to process petitions filed on behalf of groups of workers to determine their potential eligibility for services ; established a deadline for workers to enroll in training , after they have been laid off or their petition has been approved , in order to maintain eligibility for extended income support payments ; created a health coverage tax credit ( hctc ) to help trade - affected workers who are enrolled in or have completed training , or have a waiver from this requirement , pay for health insurance ; created a wage insurance benefit for workers age 50 and older , subsidizing the difference between the prior and new wages of some trade - affected workers who find reemployment quickly ; and expanded the eligibility criteria for secondary workers — defined as those who are indirectly affected by international trade , because they supply component parts to or perform finishing work for directly affected firms .
the act consolidated two former programs that served trade - affected workers — the taa and the north american free trade agreement transitional adjustment assistance ( nafta - taa ) programs — and made a number of key changes designed to expand benefits and decrease the time it takes to get workers into services .
