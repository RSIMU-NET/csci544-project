we appreciate the opportunity to participate in the subcommittee's hearing on us - visit ( the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ) , a multibillion - dollar program of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) that is intended to achieve a daunting set of goals: to enhance the security of our citizens and visitors and ensure the integrity of the u.s. immigration system , and at the same time to facilitate legitimate trade and travel and protect privacy .
to achieve these goals , us - visit is to record the entry into and exit from the united states of selected travelers , verify their identity , and determine their compliance with the terms of their admission and stay .
this legislation also directed us to review these plans .
since fiscal year 2002 , the house and senate appropriations committees have provided valuable oversight and direction to dhs on us - visit by legislatively directing it to submit annual expenditure plans for committee approval .
our reviews have produced four reports that , among other things , described dhs progress against legislatively mandated milestones and identified fundamental challenges that the department faced in delivering promised program capabilities and benefits on time and within cost .
for example , we reported in september 2003 that the program office did not have the human capital and acquisition process discipline needed to effectively manage the program .
managing us - visit effectively requires high levels of capability and expertise .
beyond these two questions , effective program management also means that the program is held accountable for results , which involves measuring and disclosing performance relative to explicitly defined program goals , outcomes , and commitments .
they have also provided recommendations to promote dhs accountability for the program .
to be sure that a program is doing the right thing , it needs to be justified by sufficient fact - based and verifiable analysis to show that the program as defined will properly fit within the larger homeland security operational and technological environments and that it will produce mission value commensurate with expected costs and risks .
over the last 4 years , our reports have provided recommendations to dhs to ensure that these questions are answered and used as the basis for informed decision making about us - visit .
to be done the right way , a program needs to be executed in a rigorous and disciplined manner , which means that it needs to employ the necessary mix of people , processes , and tools to reasonably ensure that promised program capabilities and expected mission value are delivered on time and within budget .
in light of the challenges that we identified , we concluded that the program carries an appreciable level of risk , meaning that it must be managed effectively if it is to be successful .
further , they concur with the need to implement them with due speed and diligence .
according to dhs , the recommendations have made us - visit a stronger program .
fundamentally , it entails being able to respond affirmatively to two basic questions .
these recommendations have been aimed at helping the department to ensure that this program fulfills expectations: in other words , that the program is doing the right thing in the right way , and that it is holding itself accountable for doing so .
