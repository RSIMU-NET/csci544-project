interest in cabin air quality heightened in 2003 , with reports that a small number of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) infections may have occurred on board aircraft serving areas with sars outbreaks .
the council report's 10 recommendations focused on five aspects of cabin air quality and its environment: ( 1 ) the establishment of cabin air quality surveillance and research programs , ( 2 ) faa's oversight of the operation of aircraft ventilation systems , ( 3 ) exposures on aircraft due to the transport of small animals in aircraft cabins , ( 4 ) distribution of health related information , and ( 5 ) recommended procedures as a result of a ventilation system shutdown .
in 2001 , the national research council issued a report that assessed airborne contaminants in commercial aircraft , including an evaluation of their toxicity and associated health effects ; addressed cabin pressure ( oxygen supply ) and ventilation ; and recommended approaches to improving data on cabin air quality .
specifically , our research focused on the following questions: ( 1 ) what is known about the major potential health effects of air quality in commercial airliner cabins on passengers and flight attendants ? .
specifically , you asked us to address the following questions: ( 1 ) what is known about the major potential health effects of air quality in commercial airliner cabins on passengers and flight attendants ? .
faa generally agreed with the report's contents and its recommendations .
the ranking democratic member of the subcommittee on aviation , house committee on transportation and infrastructure , asked us to provide information on steps that the aviation community is taking to address concerns about cabin air quality .
 ( 3 ) what technologies are available today to improve the air quality in commercial airliner cabins , and which , if any , should be required ? .
 ( 2 ) what actions has the national research council recommended to improve cabin air quality , and what is the status of those actions ? .
to help ensure that faa's research and surveillance efforts on airliner cabin air quality answer critical outstanding questions about the nature and extent of potential health effects of cabin air quality on passengers and flight attendants , gao recommends that the secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to develop a detailed plan for the research and surveillance efforts , including key milestones and funding estimates , in accordance with generally accepted practices for oversight and independence ; appoint a committee of acknowledged experts in the fields of aircraft ventilation and public health , including representatives of epa and niosh , to assist in planning and overseeing the research and surveillance efforts recommended by the national research council in 2001 ; leverage the findings of international research on airliner cabin air quality to inform faa's surveillance and research efforts ; and report to congress annually on the progress and findings of the research and surveillance efforts and funding needs .
the administrator should also consult with medical associations and health organizations , such as cdc , on other ways to increase the dissemination of this information .
