the objectives of our report were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) has policies for identifying and responding to possible human exposures to environmental hazards on its installations ; ( 2 ) what programs currently exist to provide health care and compensation to individuals for adverse health conditions resulting from environmental exposures on military installations and any factors that may affect these individuals' access to health care or compensation ; and ( 3 ) the features of alternative federal programs that provide medical benefits or compensation to large groups of individuals affected by a specific environmental exposure , which may be considered as possible options in the design of any future programs for individuals harmed by environmental hazards .
 ( 3 ) provide guidance on what actions , if any , dod should take to identify and address possible health risks faced by individuals from past exposures at military installations .
section 314 of the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 set out a number of congressional findings related to military environmental exposures and directed gao to conduct an assessment of possible exposures of individuals to environmental hazards while living and working on military installations.that mandate , our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which dod has policies for identifying and responding to possible human exposures to environmental hazards on its installations , ( 2 ) what programs currently exist to provide health care and compensation to individuals for health conditions resulting from environmental exposures on military installations and any factors that may affect how these individuals obtain access to health care or compensation , and ( 3 ) what features of alternative federal programs that provide medical benefits or compensation to large groups of individuals affected by a specific environmental exposure may be considered as possible options in the design of any future programs for individuals harmed by environmental hazards .
without these improvements , dod is missing opportunities to ensure that vital public health issues are adequately addressed .
congress has also expressed interest regarding how the u.s. government provides compensation and medical benefits for those who may have suffered adverse health effects from their exposure to such hazards .
however , the department of defense's ( dod ) response in identifying , studying , addressing , and communicating these three environmental hazards has raised congressional concerns in general about how dod responds to possible individual exposures to environmental hazards on its installations .
dod only recently revised its policy on health surveillance to include dependents when collecting data that could improve its ability to address health risks that may have resulted from environmental exposures .
specifically: dod stated that it will review its procedures for tracking dod's responses to agency for toxic substances and disease registry recommendations and , if needed , make the appropriate changes to its tracking system .
 ( 2 ) establish a policy that identifies when installations should consider requesting public health assessments in addition to the initial assessments at national priorities list sites .
therefore , we believe dod needs to make improvements to its tracking system .
dod stated that its cleanup policy is adequate because the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act does not require responsible parties to identify individuals who may have been exposed to contamination in the past .
