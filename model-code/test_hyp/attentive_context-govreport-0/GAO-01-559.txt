section 1051 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 ( public law 106-398 ) requires that we review the working capital fund activities of the department of defense ( dod ) to ( 1 ) identify any potential changes in current management processes or policies that , if made , would result in a more efficient operation and ( 2 ) evaluate various aspects of the dod policy that allow defense working capital fund activities to carry over a 3-month level of work from one fiscal year to the next .
this report is the first in a series of reports that responds to this requirement and addresses the working capital fund fiscal year - end workload funding issue generally referred to as “carryover.” according to dod's fiscal year 2001 budget estimates , working capital fund industrial activities will have about $7 billion of funded work that will be carried over from fiscal year 2001 into fiscal year 2002 .
specifically , our objectives were to review ( 1 ) the basis for dod's 3-month carryover policy , ( 2 ) the military services' implementation of this policy , ( 3 ) the military services' budgeted versus reported actual carryover amounts and whether there were any instances when the reported year - end carryover exceeded the 3-month policy , and ( 4 ) the potential financial and operational impact of reducing the amount of permitted carryover .
to the extent that carryover is high , the congress may redirect the funds gained from such reductions to other priority initiatives .
this report assesses the working capital fund policies and practices related to carryover .
dod's budget estimates that these activity groups will have about $6.3 billion of carryover at the end of fiscal year 2001 — about 90 percent of the defense working capital fund's $7 billion total carryover .
however , past congressional defense committee reports raised concerns that the level of carryover may be more than is needed for this purpose .
excessive amounts of carryover financed with customer appropriations are subject to reductions by dod and the congressional defense committees during the budget review process .
the congressional defense committees recognize that these industrial activities need some carryover to ensure a smooth flow of work during the transition from one fiscal year to the next .
a working capital fund relies on sales revenue rather than direct appropriations to finance its continuing operations .
a working capital fund is intended to ( 1 ) generate sufficient revenue to cover the full costs of its operations and ( 2 ) operate on a break - even basis over time — that is , not make a profit nor incur a loss .
dod's carryover guidance does not address how certain items should be treated and / or calculated and , as a result , it is a contributing factor to the military services' inconsistent implementation of dod's formula for determining the number of months of carryover .
until these weaknesses are resolved , concerns will continue to be raised about whether an activity group has too much or not enough carryover .
the military services have not consistently implemented dod's guidance for determining whether an activity group has exceeded the 3-month carryover standard .
