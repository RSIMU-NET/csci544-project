accordingly , we assessed ( 1 ) the department's progress in assessing its core functions as a basis for sourcing decisions , ( 2 ) the plans and progress dod has made in identifying and implementing alternatives to a - 76 , and ( 3 ) the current status of dod's a - 76 program .
specifically , the objectives of this report were to assess ( 1 ) the department's progress in assessing its core functions as a basis for sourcing decisions , ( 2 ) the plans and progress dod has made in identifying and implementing alternatives to a - 76 , and ( 3 ) the current status of dod's a - 76 program .
the department of defense ( dod ) is currently examining a core competency - based approach for making sourcing decisions â€” that is , the decision to use a public or private sector source to perform a necessary agency function or activity based on whether the function or activity is core to the agency's mission .
recently , dod's study goals have increased because of omb's competitive sourcing goals .
at your request , we examined dod's plans for sourcing non - core functions and the effect this may have on its a - 76 program .
in determining how to best perform non - core functions , dod's position is that its components should look beyond just the use of office of management and budget ( omb ) circular a - 76 , with its focus on public - private competitions , in making sourcing decisions .
dod has been a leader among federal agencies in using a - 76 in recent years .
also , a - 76 competitive sourcing is a major initiative under the president's management agenda and omb has set ambitious goals for those competitions .
such conversions may be a more cost - effective alternative than simply increasing military end - strength where shortages exist in military positions .
this is one of the business transformation initiatives that have been endorsed by one of dod's high - level management committees , the senior executive council .
as requested by the ranking minority member of the house committee on armed services , subcommittee on readiness , we reviewed dod's plans for sourcing non - core functions and the effect this may have on its a - 76 program .
nonetheless , despite its experience in implementing competitive sourcing , the department faces a number of challenges related to its a - 76 program .
integrating operations ( maximizing combat capability ) .
omb has established ambitious a - 76 competitive sourcing program goals for the department to meet in both the short term and the long term , even while dod is focusing on its core competency approach .
however , decisions to replace military personnel with civilians or contractors without identifying sources for increases in operations and maintenance funds to support those decisions could stress the ability of the operations and maintenance account to meet other pressing needs .
dod's fiscal year 2002 fair act inventory exempted 171,698 positions from competition because of statutory , national security , or operational concerns .
we also recommend that the secretary of defense require dod components to ensure that decisions to convert functions performed by military personnel to performance by civilians or contractors are predicated on having clearly identified sources of funding to support those decisions .
