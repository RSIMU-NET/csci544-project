3. prior years' performance ; identify opportunities for irs to reduce taxpayers' reliance on rals and refund anticipation checks ( rac ) ; and identify opportunities , based on prior gao reports such as those on higher education tax benefits , for irs to enhance taxpayer compliance during returns processing .
for example , timely issuance of refunds can reduce taxpayer demand for refund anticipation loans ( ral ) , which are short - term , often high - interest loans offered by tax preparers or banks that allow taxpayers to receive their refund cash quickly , sometimes within the same day .
the internal revenue service's ( irs ) 2009 filing season is an enormous and critical undertaking .
in light of its importance , the chair and ranking member of subcommittee on oversight , committee on ways and means , house of representatives , and the chair and ranking members of the senate finance committee asked us to provide an overall assessment of irs's 2009 filing season performance .
where irs has the statutory authority , also known as math error authority ( mea ) , it corrects certain errors before interest is owed by taxpayers , and helps taxpayers and irs avoid burdensome audits .
irs's filing season performance also has indirect effects on taxpayers .
earlier this year , we provided an interim assessment of irs's 2009 filing season performance , made recommendations to improve irs's 2010 filing season performance , and made suggestions to congress to better ensure compliance , when tax returns are being processed , with the first - time homebuyer tax credit .
last filing season , irs processed over 140 million individual income tax returns and issued over 100 million refunds .
during each of the last two filing seasons , irs has been called upon to quickly implement complex tax law changes , including economic stimulus policies that have resulted in unexpected increases in call volume and created new taxpayer compliance challenges and workload .
for this report , our objectives were to 1. assess irs's filing season performance compared to 2009 goals and 2 .
irs also answered tens of millions of taxpayer questions through telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance .
the filing season is also the time irs begins its enforcement efforts with its math error program , in which irs uses its computers to identify errors during processing , such as calculation mistakes or omitted or inconsistent entries .
interviewed irs officials about current operations , trends , and significant factors and initiatives that affected performance ; efforts to reduce reliance on rals and racs ; and monitoring and oversight of compliance issues , including higher education credit claims .
reviewed treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) reports and interviewed a tigta official about irs's performance and initiatives .
to reduce taxpayer confusion and enhance compliance with the eligibility requirements for higher education benefits , irs should determine the feasibility of using current information reported on form 1098-t , such as school location and taxpayer identification number or ssn , in irs's compliance programs ; and revise form 1098-t to improve the usefulness of information on qualifying education expenses .
