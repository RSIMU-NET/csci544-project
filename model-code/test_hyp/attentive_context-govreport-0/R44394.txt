there are several ways to measure traffic safety: the number of highway fatalities ; the number of serious injuries from crashes ; the economic loss to people involved in crashes ; and the social cost of emergency response and accident - induced traffic delays .
to understand these numbers in context , other measures are often applied to produce rates such as number of events per million miles traveled , per million registered drivers , and per million persons in the total population .
as figure 1 indicates , the fatality rate has improved significantly since the passage of the first federal highway safety legislation in 1966 .
the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled ( vmt ) is the most commonly cited measure of traffic safety , due in part to the seriousness of that outcome and in part to the fact that fatalities are closely tracked and unambiguous .
the rate of crashes resulting in serious injuries was significantly higher in 2013 than in 2008 , and the overall crash rate has been rising ( figure 2 ) .
in contrast , crashes involving injuries or property damage may be reported inconsistently by local public safety agencies or may not come to the attention of authorities ; reported data on the numbers of serious crashes and of crashes involving injuries are estimated based on sampling .
instead , it has had to rely on both carrots ( incentive grants ) and sticks ( penalties that reduce federal transportation funding ) to influence state governments to adopt and enforce traffic safety measures affecting driver behavior .
there have been four periods of abrupt declines in the fatality rate since 1970 , all of which coincided with recessions ; in each instance , the decline was followed by a period of little improvement or even an increase in the fatality rate as the economy emerged from recession .
however , the improvement has not been continuous .
similar measures can reveal trends for narrower categories such as vehicle occupants and bicyclists .
however , some of the change in accident and fatality rates over the past several decades is attributable to factors beyond the scope of federal highway safety policies .
as the fatality rate has become lower , reductions in that rate have necessarily become more modest: over the past 20 years it dropped from around 1.8 to 1.1 .
although the fatality rate from motor vehicle crashes has fallen to a record low , other measures indicate that improvement in traffic safety has stalled .
these tools may be used , in different ways , to achieve three traffic safety goals: reducing the number of crashes ; reducing the severity of crashes ; and improving medical care for people injured in crashes .
the number of people killed in traffic - related crashes dropped from a high of around 55,000 in 1972 to around 33,000 in 2013 .
highway safety rates and trends vary by state .
nearly every crash involving a fatality is investigated and clearly identified as a vehicle - related incident .
in addition , some states have relatively strict laws concerning safety matters , such as enforcement of mandatory seat belt use and requirements that motorcyclists wear helmets , while other states have fewer safety laws or enforce such laws less vigorously .
