however , over many years , va has experienced challenges in managing its it projects and programs , raising questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and its ability to deliver intended outcomes needed to help advance the department's mission .
these challenges have spanned a number of critical initiatives related to sharing electronic health record data and developing major systems , in addition to improving the efficiency of operations by closing and optimizing data centers and decommissioning antiquated legacy systems .
in addition , it discusses our prior work on the department's development and use of its benefits claims processing system , the veterans benefits management system ( vbms ) , as well as our recent reports that addressed va's data center consolidation and legacy systems .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the information technology ( it ) modernization projects and programs at the department of veterans affairs ( va ) .
as you know , the use of it is crucial to helping va effectively serve the nation's veterans and , each year , the department spends billions of dollars on its information systems and assets .
at your request , my testimony today summarizes findings from a number of our reports that addressed va's efforts toward exchanging electronic health records with the department of defense ( dod ) and highlighted it challenges that have contributed to our designation of va health care as a high - risk area .
we have previously reported on these and other it management challenges at the department .
in developing this testimony , we relied on our previous reports , as well as information provided by the department on its actions in response to our previous recommendations .
however , the department faces challenges in several key areas , including its approach to pursuing electronic health record interoperability with dod .
the ipo is responsible for monitoring and reporting on va's and dod's progress in achieving interoperability and coordinating with the departments to ensure that these efforts enhance health care services .
in addition , va's continued operation of two of the oldest legacy it systems in the federal government raises concern about the extent to which the department continues to spend funds on it systems that are no longer effective or cost beneficial .
while we recognize that va has initiated steps to mitigate the it management weaknesses we have identified , sustained management attention and organizational commitment will be essential to ensuring that the transformation is successful and that the weaknesses are fully addressed .
system availability: although vba had improved its performance regarding system availability to users , it had not established system response time goals .
as such , va's approach to addressing its electronic health record system needs remains uncertain .
although va has proceeded with its program to modernize vista ( known as vista evolution ) , the department's long - term plan for meeting its electronic health record system needs beyond fiscal year 2018 is uncertain .
beyond modernizing vista , va has undertaken numerous initiatives with dod that were intended to advance electronic health record interoperability between the two departments .
since 1998 , va has undertaken a patchwork of initiatives with dod to allow the departments' health information systems to exchange information and increase interoperability .
