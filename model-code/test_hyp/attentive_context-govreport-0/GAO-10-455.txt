the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) of 2006 required gao to evaluate strategies and options for the long - term structural and operational reform of the united states postal service ( usps ) .
our objectives were to assess ( 1 ) the viability of usps's business model , ( 2 ) strategies and options to address the challenges to usps's current business model , and ( 3 ) actions congress and usps need to take to facilitate progress toward usps's financial viability .
the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) of 2006 required us to report on strategies and options for the long - term structural and operational reform of the united states postal service ( usps ) .
these proposals could focus on adapting delivery and retail services to declining mail volumes ; making postal operations , networks , and workforce more cost - efficient ; and generating new revenue .
these changes provided additional tools to improve its effectiveness and accountability in an increasingly competitive delivery and communications marketplace .
these reports could include the actions taken to reduce costs and increase revenues , the results of these actions , and progress toward addressing financial problems .
in fiscal year 2010 , usps expects a record loss of over $7 billion , its outstanding debt to increase to $13.2 billion , and limited cash flow that will continue to constrain capital investment .
at that time , usps was given additional pricing flexibility and required to develop service standards , while paea reconfigured certain financial obligations .
recent developments have highlighted deficiencies in usps's business model , which is to fulfill its mission through self - supporting , businesslike operations .
congress also should consider requiring usps to provide regular reports to congress to ensure that usps is making progress to improve its financial condition .
making the necessary progress would require ( 1 ) taking more aggressive actions to reduce costs and increase revenues within its current authority , using the collective bargaining process to address wages , benefits , and workforce flexibility , and ( 2 ) congressional action to address legal restrictions and resistance to realigning usps operations , networks , and workforce .
these volume declines have been brought on by customers' changing use of the mail and have been accelerated by the recession and continuing difficulties in the economy .
usps has incurred close to $12 billion in losses in fiscal years 2007 through 2009 and is rapidly approaching its statutory debt limit .
at the same time , to facilitate making progress in difficult areas , congress should consider establishing ( 1 ) a panel of independent experts , similar to a brac - like commission , to coordinate with usps and stakeholders to develop a package of proposed legislative and operational changes needed to reduce costs and address challenges to usps's business model and ( 2 ) procedures for the review and approval of these proposals by the president and congress .
usps's financial outlook is poor .
as mail volume declined in fiscal years 2007 through 2009 , usps financial viability deteriorated , and it was not able to cut costs fast enough to offset the accelerated decline in mail volume and revenue .
