the shutdown of these reactors has been a long - standing nonproliferation goal of the united states , and efforts to secure their closure have continued for over a decade .
russia's continued operation of three plutonium production reactors , which together produce enough weapons - grade plutonium each year for about 300 nuclear weapons , poses a serious proliferation threat .
to address concerns about large carryover balances of program funding , we recommend that the secretary of energy and the administrator of the national nuclear security administration monitor funding requirements to ensure that funds are obligated in a determine whether future funding requirements need to be reduced in light of the slow rate of spending to date on the program .
this report ( 1 ) describes doe's efforts to manage and implement the program since it was transferred from dod , ( 2 ) assesses the challenges that doe faces in achieving its goal of shutting down the reactors , and ( 3 ) identifies doe's current expenditures and projected costs to implement the program .
final shutdown of russia's three plutonium production reactors is uncertain because doe faces challenges in implementing its program .
this plutonium — up to 1.2 metric tons produced annually — is being added to russia's already vast stockpile of weapons - usable nuclear material .
doe has developed an overall management plan for its program that ( 1 ) emphasizes detailed project planning , ( 2 ) seeks to identify project risks , and ( 3 ) develops alternative strategies to reduce risks .
some actions that russia has taken raise serious questions about its commitment to the nonproliferation and safety - related goals of doe's program .
both agencies stated that russia rejected these initiatives primarily due to its security concerns about granting u.s. officials access to the reactors .
by 1992 , russia had shut down all but 3 of its 13 plutonium production reactors — 2 continue to operate in the closed nuclear city of seversk and 1 in the closed nuclear city of zheleznogorsk .
the history of u.s. - russian nonproliferation activities has demonstrated that some well - intentioned programs have had limited success because the agreements governing them lacked specificity or oversight was inadequate .
russia's recent rejection of doe's initiatives to reduce the amount of plutonium being produced by the reactors and to improve the safety of the reactors prior to their shutdown raises serious questions about russia's commitment to the fundamental nonproliferation and safety goals of the program .
doe's national nuclear security administration said the draft report provided a balanced evaluation of its program to shut down russia's three plutonium production reactors .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
doe's slow rate of spending on program activities has led to about $179.1 million in unobligated and unspent funds .
without implementing doe's proposed safety upgrades , the safety risks posed by the reactors will continue to increase dramatically .
perhaps the most important of these challenges is ensuring russia's commitment to key aspects of the program .
