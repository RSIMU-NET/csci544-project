as part of our ongoing work examining how federal agencies have used buyouts to downsize the federal workforce , you asked that we compare the projected costs and savings of buyouts with an alternative downsizing strategy , reductions - in - force ( rif ) , over a 5-year period .
because such an analysis is dependent on many factors that may vary considerably among agencies , we used a variety of assumptions and scenarios in our analysis to determine the average costs and savings of each method .
we based our analysis on available workforce data and on the results of earlier studies completed by us and by other organizations .
this report describes and compares the circumstances under which buyouts or rifs offer greater potential savings , but it does not calculate or compare the actual costs of either alternative in past years .
these effects included the ability to use buyouts to restructure agency workforces , retain or improve workforce diversity , and avoid lowering productivity and morale .
two driving forces in the reductions have been the federal workforce restructuring act of 1994 and the national performance review ( npr ) .
both congress and the administration have agreed that federal employment levels should be cut as a means of reducing federal costs and controlling deficits .
through a series of executive orders and legislation , goals have been established for reducing federal staffing levels .
the act , passed in march 1994 , mandated governmentwide reductions of 272,900 full time equivalent ( fte ) positions through fiscal year 1999 .
congress is considering new legislation that would again give non - dod agencies temporary authority to pay retirement and separation incentives .
for many federal agencies , achieving reduced staffing levels cannot be attained by relying solely on attrition .
over 112,500 buyouts have been paid to employees governmentwide since dod was authorized use of the authority in early 1993 .
these procedures give favorable consideration in layoff decisions to employees with ( 1 ) career appointments , ( 2 ) military veteran status , ( 3 ) seniority , and ( 4 ) good job performance .
dod was authorized use of the buyout authority through separate legislation .
one approach that has been historically available to agencies is rifs .
the npr recommended that any reductions be accomplished through agency efforts to streamline operations , reduce “management control” and headquarters positions , and improve government operations through reinvention and quality management techniques .
varying assumptions have been used in past economic studies of buyouts and rifs .
while economics play an important part in an agency's decision on which downsizing strategy to use , noneconomic effects were also described to us by agency officials .
the studies we reviewed included our 1985 study of rifs,a 1994 dod study of buyouts and rifs , a 1993 congressional budget office study of buyouts and rifs , and a 1995 office of personnel management ( opm ) analysis of buyout and rif costs .
the economics of workforce reduction strategies can vary widely among agencies depending on ( 1 ) the positions eliminated , ( 2 ) the demographics of the retirement eligible population , ( 3 ) how early in the fiscal year separations are made , and ( 4 ) whether positions are refilled , eliminated , or the work contracted out .
