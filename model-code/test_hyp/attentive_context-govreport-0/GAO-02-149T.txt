on september 28 , 2001 , we released a report that describes ( 1 ) the research and preparedness activities being undertaken by federal departments and agencies to manage the consequences of a bioterrorist attack , ( 2 ) the coordination of these activities , and ( 3 ) the findings of reports on the preparedness of state and local jurisdictions to respond to a bioterrorist attack .
preparing to respond to the public health and medical consequences of a bioterrorist attack poses some challenges that are different from those in other types of terrorist attacks , such as bombings .
i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our work on the activities of federal agencies to prepare the nation to respond to the public health and medical consequences of a bioterrorist attack .
these agencies are participating in a variety of activities , from improving the detection of biological agents to developing a national stockpile of pharmaceuticals to treat victims of disasters .
in summary , we identified more than 20 federal departments and agencies as having a role in preparing for or responding to the public health and medical consequences of a bioterrorist attack .
in addition , we found emerging concerns about the preparedness of state and local jurisdictions , including insufficient state and local planning for response to terrorist events , a lack of hospital participation in training on terrorism and emergency response planning , the timely availability of medical teams and resources in an emergency , and inadequacies in the public health infrastructure .
the last includes weaknesses in the training of health care providers , communication among responsible parties , and capacity of laboratories and hospitals , including the ability to treat mass casualties .
federal departments and agencies have engaged in a number of efforts to coordinate these activities on a formal and informal basis , such as interagency work groups .
despite these efforts , we found evidence that coordination between departments and agencies is fragmented .
my testimony will summarize the detailed findings included in our report , highlighting weaknesses in the public health infrastructure that we have identified in our ongoing work and which we believe warrant special attention .
we did , however , find recent actions to improve coordination across federal departments and agencies .
its funding has increased from approximately $121 million at that time to approximately $194 million in fiscal year 2001 .
federal spending on domestic preparedness for terrorist attacks involving wmds has risen 310 percent since fiscal year 1998 , to approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2001 , and may increase significantly after the events of september 11 , 2001 .
for example , several different agencies are responsible for various coordination functions , which limits accountability and hinders unity of effort ; several key agencies have not been included in bioterrorism - related policy and response planning ; and the programs that agencies have developed to provide assistance to state and local governments are similar and potentially duplicative .
over 40 federal departments and agencies have some role in combating terrorism , and coordinating their activities is a significant challenge .
overall coordination of federal programs to combat terrorism is fragmented .
several agencies received little or no funding in fiscal year 1998 .
