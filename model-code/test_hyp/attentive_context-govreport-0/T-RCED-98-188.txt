our report discussed three main issues: ( 1 ) the practice of using individual inspectors in repair station inspections ; ( 2 ) the condition of inspection documentation ; and ( 3 ) current faa actions to improve the inspection process .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) oversight of repair stations that maintain and repair aircraft and aircraft components .
in recent years , faa's oversight of repair stations has become a matter of concern , in part because the work performed by repair stations has been identified as a factor in several aircraft accidents .
since the may 1996 crash of a valujet dc - 9 in the florida everglades , faa has announced new initiatives to upgrade the oversight of repair stations .
we also found that while faa typically relies on individual inspectors , the use of teams of inspectors , particularly at large or complex repair stations , may be more effective at identifying problems and are more liable to uncover systemic and long - standing deficiencies .
because faa does not tell its inspectors what documentation to keep , the agency's ability to identify and react to trends is hampered .
faa is spending more than $30 million to develop a reporting system that , among other things , is designed to enable the agency to apply its inspection resources to address those areas that pose the greatest risk to aviation safety .
we also surveyed inspectors responsible for repair stations to obtain their views on how faa's oversight could be improved .
finally , faa has recently announced a major overhaul of its entire inspection process .
it is designed to systematize the process and ensure consistency in inspections and in reporting the results of these inspections so as to allow more efficient targeting of inspection resources .
for example , the national transportation safety board determined that a fatigue fracture from corrosion pits that were not discovered or properly repaired by a repair station was the probable cause of a propeller loss on an atlantic southeast airlines embraer - 120 in august 1995 .
these initiatives were directed at clarifying and augmenting air carriers' oversight of repair stations , not at ways in which faa's own inspection resources could be better utilized .
however , faa has several other efforts under way that would have a more direct bearing on its own inspection activities at repair stations .
however , the revision of the regulations began in 1989 and has been repeatedly delayed .
this effort is scheduled to be implemented in the fall of 1998 .
the propeller loss occurred at 18,000 feet , and the plane crashed during an emergency landing , killing 8 and injuring 21 others on board .
however , more than half of the inspectors said that there were areas of compliance that repair stations could improve , such as ensuring that their personnel receive training from all airlines for which they perform work and have current maintenance manuals .
last year , at the request of the ranking minority member of this subcommittee and senator ron wyden , we reported on faa's oversight of repair stations .
faa was meeting its goal of inspecting every repair station at least once a year and 84 percent of the inspectors believed that the overall compliance of repair stations was good or excellent .
