i appreciate the opportunity to testify on the results of our work on the management of first responder grants in the national capital region ( ncr ) .
what has been the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) role to date in enhancing the preparedness of ncr through such actions as coordinating the use of federal emergency preparedness grants , assessing preparedness , providing guidance , targeting funds to enhance preparedness , and monitoring the use of those funds ? .
what challenges exist within ncr to organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs ? .
our report addressed the following questions: what federal funds have been allocated to local jurisdictions in ncr for emergency preparedness , for what specific purposes , and from what sources ? .
to respond to these questions , we met with and obtained documentation from officials of dhs including its office for national capital region coordination ( oncrc ) , the senior policy group , the metropolitan council of governments , state emergency management agencies , and first responder officials from ncr jurisdictions .
our report is being released today , and my testimony highlights the major findings and recommendations of that report .
these 16 grants were selected to cover a range of programs , including the largest funding sources ; grants provided for general purposes , such as equipment and training ; and grants provided for specific purposes , such as fire prevention and bioterrorism .
what gaps , if any , remain in the emergency preparedness of ncr ? .
oncrc has concentrated its efforts on developing a coordinated assessment and plan for the use of urban area security initiative funds .
effectively managing first responder federal grants funds requires the ability to measure progress and provide accountability for the use of public funds .
third , there is no established process or means for regularly and reliably collecting data on ( 1 ) the amounts of first responder grants available to each jurisdiction and ( 2 ) the budget plans and criteria used for determining spending allocations and budget priorities .
the lack of benchmarks and performance goals may contribute to difficulties in developing a coordinated region - wide plan for determining how to spend federal funds and assessing the benefits of that spending .
as with other major policy areas , demonstrating the results of homeland security efforts includes developing and implementing strategies , establishing baselines , developing and implementing performance goals and data quality standards , collecting reliable data , analyzing the data , assessing the results , and taking action based on the results .
according to dhs , a governance structure was approved in february 2004 that will provide the essential region - wide coordination that is necessary .
we identified 25 emergency preparedness programs that provided funding to ncr jurisdictions in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 , and we selected 16 of them for detailed review .
to help ensure that emergency preparedness grants and associated funds are managed in a way that maximizes their effectiveness , we recommend that the secretary of the department of homeland security take the following three actions to fulfill dhs's statutory responsibilities in ncr: work with ncr jurisdictions to develop a coordinated strategic plan to establish goals and priorities for enhancing first responder capacities that can be used to guide the use of federal emergency preparedness funds .
