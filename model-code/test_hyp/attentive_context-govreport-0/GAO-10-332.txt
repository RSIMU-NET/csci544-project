the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) have long - standing efforts to increase sharing of data between their health information systems .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , our objectives for this fourth report are to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) dod and va developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by the september 30 , 2009 , deadline and ( 2 ) the interagency program office established by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 is functioning as a single point of accountability for developing and implementing electronic health records .
to determine the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by the september 30 , 2009 , deadline , we reviewed our previous work on dod and va efforts to develop health information systems , interoperable health records , and interoperability standards to be implemented in federal health care programs .
to expedite the exchange of electronic health information between the two departments , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 included provisions directing dod and va to jointly develop and implement , by september 30 , 2009 , fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities that are compliant with applicable federal interoperability standards .
as a result , the interagency program office's ability to effectively provide oversight and management , including meaningful progress reporting on the delivery of interoperable capabilities , is jeopardized .
further , the act directed us to assess dod's and va's progress in implementing the electronic health record systems and to semiannually report our results to the appropriate congressional committees .
however , while the departments have progressively increased electronic health information sharing , questions have been raised about when and to what extent the departments intend such sharing capabilities to be fully achieved .
furthermore , implementation of our recommendations will also better position the office to function as a single point of accountability for the delivery of interoperable electronic health records , which are intended to improve service members' and veterans' health care .
if the departments continue to implement our recommendations , they should be better positioned to effectively manage their ongoing efforts to increase their interoperable electronic health record capabilities .
if the departments fully implement our recommendations , they will have the comprehensive picture that they need for effectively defining and managing progress toward meeting their interoperability objectives and goals , including vler .
such systems and capabilities are important for making patient information more readily available to health care providers in the departments , reducing medical errors , and streamlining administrative functions .
in addition , the act established an interagency program office to be a single point of accountability for the departments' efforts .
our january 2009 report noted that the departments had defined plans to further increase their sharing of electronic health information ; however , the plans did not contain results - oriented ( i.e. , objective , quantifiable , and measurable ) performance goals and measures that could be used as a basis to track and assess progress .
