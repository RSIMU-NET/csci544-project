most federal offshore oil and gas production leases contain royalty provisions that require the lessee to pay a certain percentage of revenue on the value of oil and natural gas production to the federal government as the lessor .
in 1995 , congress passed the deep water royalty relief act ( dwrra ) , which provides an incentive for exploration of oil and natural gas reserves in "deep water," which might otherwise be uneconomic , by providing that a certain initial volume of production from deep water wells would be exempt from royalty obligations .
as a result , holders of these 1998 and 1999 deepwater leases have no obligations to make royalty payments up to the suspension volumes , regardless of the market price of oil or natural gas ; the leases do not contain a price threshold on royalty relief .
any holder of a "covered lease" is forced to decide between three options: ( 1 ) the lessee can keep the lease under its current terms ( i.e. , without a price threshold ) and lose the right to bid on future offshore lease sales in the gulf of mexico ; ( 2 ) the lessee can pay a newly created "conservation of resources" fee , as established elsewhere in the proposed act ; or ( 3 ) the lessee can renegotiate the covered lease to include royalty relief price thresholds .
included in this omnibus energy bill is the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 .
in 1998 and 1999 , mms issued deepwater offshore leases that were eligible for royalty suspension but did not include a price - based limitation on that eligibility .
while section 302 of the dwrra addresses royalty relief for holders of leases in existence at the time of the enactment of the act , sections 303 and 304 address post - enactment lease sales .
section 302 of the dwrra provides a mechanism by which holders of existing leases can apply for royalty relief , which is to be granted by the secretary of the interior if the lease would otherwise be uneconomic .
as discussed above , section 7504 requires that persons who hold "covered leases" either: ( 1 ) renegotiate their leases to include price thresholds ; ( 2 ) pay a "conservation of resources" fee as set forth in the section ; or ( 3 ) forfeit eligibility for future oil or gas production leases in the gulf of mexico .
however , section 302 also provides that these lessees will not be eligible for royalty relief if the price of oil or natural gas exceeds a certain threshold level .
around the same time that the perceived oversight in the 1998 and 1999 leases described above was brought to the public's attention , kerr - mcgee oil & gas corp. ( kerr - mcgee ) initiated litigation that challenged the authority of the department of the interior ( doi ) to impose price thresholds on leases sold between 1996 and 2000 ( i.e. , the effective period of section 304 of the dwrra ) .
pursuant to section 304 , the standard royalty requirement is to be suspended for lessees holding these leases until a certain volume of oil or natural gas is produced by the lessee .
