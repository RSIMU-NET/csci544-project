among other things , our report identified ( 1 ) how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal laws , ( 2 ) challenges associated with federal investigations and prosecutions of rogue internet pharmacies , ( 3 ) efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and ( 4 ) efforts to educate consumers about the risks of rogue internet pharmacies and how to recognize legitimate online pharmacies .
it regularly scans the internet and , using nabp's standards , classifies internet pharmacies into one of four categories: ( 1 ) legitimate , ( 2 ) not recommended , ( 3 ) rogue , or ( 4 ) pending review .
u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for enforcing laws prohibiting the illegal importation of goods , including prescription drugs that have not been approved for marketing in the united states by fda .
the department of justice ( doj ) may investigate and prosecute an operator of an internet pharmacy that is suspected of violating federal laws .
while some internet pharmacies are legitimate businesses that offer consumers a safe , convenient , and cost - effective way to obtain their medications , the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the national association of boards of pharmacy ( nabp ) have reported that thousands are fraudulent enterprises .
u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is responsible for , among other things , investigating violations of customs and trade laws , including those related to trafficking in counterfeit goods .
despite these actions of agencies and stakeholders , consumer education efforts face many challenges .
for example , fda is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs , and fda approval is required prior to marketing prescription drugs in the united states .
to identify efforts to educate consumers about the risks of rogue internet pharmacies and how to recognize legitimate online pharmacies , we interviewed officials from federal agencies and stakeholders to discuss their consumer education efforts .
many rogue internet pharmacies seek to take advantage of this perception by purporting to be located in canada , or sell drugs manufactured or approved for sale in canada , when they are actually located elsewhere or selling drugs sourced from other countries .
like brick - and - mortar pharmacies , internet pharmacies are subject to federal and state statutes and regulations that are designed to ensure the safety , efficacy , and proper administration of medications .
despite fda warnings to consumers that the agency could not ensure the safety of drugs not approved for sale in the united states that are purchased from other countries , the prevalence of such programs may have contributed to a perception among u.s. consumers that they can readily save money and obtain safe prescription drugs by purchasing them from canada .
in addition to counterfeit drugs , these “rogue” internet pharmacies often sell prescription drugs that have not been approved for sale in the united states , are substandard and have no therapeutic value , or are harmful to consumers .
despite these challenges , federal agencies and others have taken actions to combat rogue internet pharmacies .
instead , a number of federal and state agencies share responsibility for regulating prescription drugs that are marketed and sold to u.s. consumers , including by internet pharmacies .
