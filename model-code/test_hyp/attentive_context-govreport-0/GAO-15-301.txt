cer , research that evaluates and compares health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness , risks , and benefits of two or more medical treatments , services , or items such as health care interventions , is important because more than half of all medical treatments may be delivered without clear evidence of effectiveness , according to the institute of medicine ( iom ) .
ppaca also mandated gao to review hhs's cer - related activities in 2015 and 2018 .
in addition to establishing the two advisory panels required by ppaca , pcori has also established five additional advisory panels: ( 1 ) assessment of prevention , diagnosis , and treatment options ; ( 2 ) improving healthcare systems ; ( 3 ) addressing disparities ; ( 4 ) patient engagement ; and ( 5 ) communication and dissemination research .
in 2012 , pcori established five broad research priorities: ( 1 ) assessment of prevention , diagnosis , and treatment options ; ( 2 ) improving health care systems ; ( 3 ) communication and dissemination research ; ( 4 ) addressing disparities ; and ( 5 ) accelerating patient - centered outcomes research and methodological research .
specifically , ppaca directed pcori to establish priorities for research that take into account factors that include disease incidence , prevalence , and burden ; gaps in evidence with regard to clinical outcomes ; patient needs , outcomes , and preferences ; and practice variations and health disparities in terms of delivery and outcomes of care , among other things .
