as requested , this statement summarizes our draft report that ( 1 ) determines the status and plans of efforts to restructure the center weather service units , ( 2 ) evaluates efforts to establish a baseline of the current performance provided by the center weather service units so that faa and nws can ensure that any operational changes do not degrade aviation weather services , and ( 3 ) evaluates challenges to restructuring the center weather service units .
the national weather service ( nws ) plays a significant role in providing weather services to the aviation community .
we identified both agencies' efforts to establish a baseline of current performance and compared these efforts to government guidance and best practices of leading organizations in performance management .
to identify challenges , we compared the agencies' plans with best practices of leading organizations in system development , interagency collaboration , and architecture planning .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the proposed changes to the aviation weather services provided at the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) en route centers .
in september 2005 , faa asked nws to restructure its services to be more efficient .
since then , nws has developed and submitted two proposals to faa , both of which were rejected .
in preparing our draft report and this testimony , we reviewed nws's proposals and transition plans for restructuring the service units and faa's response to nws's proposals .
nws's weather products and data are vital components of faa's air traffic control system , providing weather information to local , regional , and national air traffic management , navigation , and surveillance systems .
these include challenges associated with ( 1 ) interagency collaboration , ( 2 ) defining requirements , and ( 3 ) aligning any changes with the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) — a long - term initiative to increase the efficiency of the national airspace system .
over the last few years , faa and nws have been exploring options for enhancing the efficiency of the aviation weather services provided at en route centers .
nws aviation weather products include forecasts and warnings of meteorological conditions that could affect air traffic , including thunderstorms , air turbulence , and icing .
in addition to providing aviation weather products that are developed at its own facilities , nws also provides staff on - site at each of faa's en route centers — the facilities that control high - altitude flight outside the airport tower and terminal areas .
for the draft report on which this testimony is based , we determined the status of nws's plans for restructuring the center weather service units by reviewing the existing interagency agreement , faa's proposed requirements , and nws's draft and final proposals for addressing faa's requirements .
other key contributors to this testimony include colleen phillips , assistant director ; gerard aflague ; kate agatone ; neil doherty ; rebecca eyler ; and jessica waselkow .
looking forward , if a proposal is accepted , the agencies could face three additional challenges in implementing the proposal , including ( 1 ) developing a feasible schedule that includes adequate time for stakeholder involvement , ( 2 ) undertaking a comprehensive demonstration to ensure no services are degraded , and ( 3 ) effectively reconfiguring the infrastructure and technologies to the new structure .
