medicare administrative contractors ( mac ) , on behalf of the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , process and pay ffs claims for health care items and services submitted by medicare providers .
this appendix provides additional details regarding our analysis of ( 1 ) trends in medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 ; ( 2 ) differences in claim - level and appeal - level reversal rates ; ( 3 ) appeals resolved by the centers for medicare & medicaid services' ( cms ) global settlement ; ( 4 ) cms's estimate of interest paid by the agency to certain providers ; and ( 5 ) data reliability .
in fiscal year 2014 , medicare processed 1.2 billion fee - for - service ( ffs ) claims submitted by providers or suppliers on behalf of beneficiaries .
the three appeals data systems are the contractor reporting of operational and workload data ( crowd ) system , the medicare appeals system ( mas ) , and the medicare operations division automated case tracking system ( modacts ) .
hhs efforts to reduce the number of appeals and the appeal backlog .
when medicare denies or reduces payment for an item or service , health care providers , beneficiaries , and state medicaid agencies , or their representatives , may appeal these coverage decisions through a medicare ffs appeals process .
macs and other cms contractors also identify and deny for payment health care claims that are invalid or otherwise improper as part of cms's responsibility to ensure payments to medicare providers are made correctly .
as a result , hhs and members of congress have considered ways to streamline the medicare appeals process and improve the timeliness with which appeals are decided .
to examine trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 — the 5 most recent and complete fiscal years at the time we began our analysis — we analyzed extracts of three data systems we obtained from the hhs components responsible for the medicare appeals process: cms ; the office of medicare hearings and appeals ( omha ) , an hhs staff division ; and the medicare appeals council ( the council ) within the departmental appeals board ( dab ) , which is also an hhs staff division .
in this report , we examine 1. trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 ; 2. data hhs uses to monitor the medicare appeals process ; and 3 .
hhs generally agreed with four of the five draft recommendations and outlined a number of initiatives it is taking to improve the efficiency of the medicare appeals process , reduce the backlog of pending appeals , and mitigate the possibility of future backlogs .
according to hhs , in fiscal year 2014 , medicare denied 128 million ffs claims , or 10.5 percent of claims submitted .
currently , hhs data systems are not collecting additional information that would assist hhs agencies in their monitoring efforts .
hhs also expressed its willingness to modify the appeal data systems in order to collect consistent data across the appeal data systems and to implement a more efficient way to adjudicate certain repetitive claims .
