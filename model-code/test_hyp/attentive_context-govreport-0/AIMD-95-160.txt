the 1990 amendments require the states to collect , analyze , and report information to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) epa's planned state emissions reporting requirements exceed the agency's program needs and ( 2 ) states use epa's aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) to monitor emissions data .
after the amendments were passed , the chairman of the former environment , energy , and natural resources subcommittee expressed concern that epa and the states could be overwhelmed by the collection and reporting requirements of the law and might not be able to make appropriate use of the information .
this report conveys the results of our evaluation of selected data collection and reporting requirements of the clean air act amendments of 1990 .
epa began work on the now suspended emissions regulation in order to consolidate and standardize several state emissions reporting requirements ( i.e. , emission statements , periodic emission inventories , and annual statewide point source reporting ) and to align these requirements with the mandates in the 1990 amendments .
epa has suspended its promulgation of the regulation and has recently begun studying alternative reporting options .
epa acknowledged these concerns and has suspended the regulation .
the clean air act gives epa authority to set national standards to protect human health and the environment from emissions that pollute ambient ( outdoor ) air .
epa's draft regulation on states' reporting of air pollution emissions exceeded what was needed by epa to meet minimum agency air pollution program needs .
we believe the report adequately reflects epa's process and states' concern with the additional burden that would have been imposed on them if the draft regulation had been promulgated .
to determine whether epa's planned state emissions reporting requirements exceeded the agency's actual program needs , we reviewed the clean air act , and we analyzed various information reporting requirements of the 1990 amendments and epa documents interpreting requirements of the amendments .
budgeted subsystem costs were not available for fiscal year 1996 .
the act assigns primary responsibility for ensuring adequate air quality to the states .
neither of these estimates include states' personnel costs .
in december 1994 , epa issued a study that stated that minimum program needs could be met with a fraction of the data that would have been required by the suspended regulation .
when airs was originally designed , states were expected to be one of its primary users ; however , most heavy emission states now use their own systems because these systems are more efficient and easier to use than airs .
expands several existing information collection , storage , and reporting requirements currently being met by the aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) .
the acting director also commented that the report did not adequately reflect epa's efforts to respond to the states' concerns .
our analysis of the study revealed that , in one case , epa only needed to collect about 20 percent of the volatile organic compounds data requested in the suspended regulation to meet minimum program needs .
budgeted operating and maintenance costs for fiscal year 1996 are projected to be $2.7 million .
