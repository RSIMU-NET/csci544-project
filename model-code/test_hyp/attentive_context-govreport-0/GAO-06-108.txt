as agreed with your offices , we are providing information on: ( 1 ) examples of strategies being used to help tanf recipients increase their incomes through employment ; ( 2 ) the key factors related to implementing and operating such strategies ; and ( 3 ) the actions hhs has taken to facilitate the use of these strategies .
the centerpiece of this legislation is the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , under which states receive federal funds to design and operate their own welfare programs within federal guidelines .
since states have implemented welfare reforms , they have spent almost $200 billion in federal and state tanf funds to meet the broad goals of the law , including ending the dependence of low - income parents on government benefits through job preparation , work , and marriage .
potential benefits include improved household incomes , reductions in government benefit programs , and increased contributions to the nation's workforce .
seek out additional opportunities to work with the secretaries of labor and education to jointly conduct and promote research and distribute information and implementation assistance related to enhancing skills and earnings capacity among low - income parents .
much less is known , however , about how welfare - to - work programs can increase participants' earnings , and ultimately household incomes .
in addition to tanf funds , state welfare agencies draw on a vast array of federal , state , and community programs and services to assist tanf recipients' work efforts , including employment , training , and education programs overseen by the departments of labor and education .
much remains to be explored about whether and how best to incorporate education and training into the lives of low - income parents to improve employment outcomes .
while many entities at all levels of government are involved in providing support and services to tanf recipients , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is responsible for overseeing welfare reform at the federal level .
2. review existing research dissemination and technical assistance efforts across its relevant units to better ensure a comprehensive process for distributing information and implementation assistance to the wide range of program administrators and programs involved in welfare reform .
to help ensure that the federal government considers research on these promising strategies and better informs welfare agencies and programs about how they might incorporate such strategies for tanf recipients , we recommend that the secretary of hhs: 1. review its current research agenda and identify opportunities to conduct and promote additional research on increasing earnings capacity among low - income parents .
current federal and state welfare reforms are built upon a considerable research base showing that welfare - to - work programs can succeed in moving welfare recipients into jobs and reduce their reliance on public assistance .
as congress considers reauthorization of welfare reform , much attention has focused on helping welfare families transition to more stable and higher - paying employment and ending welfare dependence .
in some cases , hhs' comments included information on research , dissemination , or technical assistance activities that it had not shared with us earlier ; these have been added to the report .
