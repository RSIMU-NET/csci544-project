the regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over what constitutes equitable distribution of federal highway aid among the states .
for many years , "donor states" ( mostly in the south , but also including some states in the midwest and the west ) have complained that they receive significantly less federal highway aid than their highway users pay into the highway account of the highway trust fund ( htf ; unless otherwise indicated all references to the htf are to the highway account ) .
the most recent multi - year authorization , the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea ; p.l .
on the other side of the debate , "donee states," those that receive more federal highway aid than they pay in federal highway taxes , have opposed any reduction in their existing shares of total federal highway aid .
the donor - donee issue has often been the most difficult issue to resolve during surface transportation reauthorization .
since 1982 , congress has included provisions in every surface transportation reauthorization act to address these distributional concerns by assuring that each state receives at least a specified proportion of its trust - fund contributions in highway grants .
a series of extension acts has extended safetea , most recently through december 31 , 2011 .

historically , transportation policy battle lines have often formed along regional rather than partisan alignments .
the concern by states that federal spending might benefit other states' road infrastructure more than their own has a long history .
"scope" issues an issue related to the federal role issue is whether a high rate of return percentage , such as 95% , coupled with a similarly broad program scope could constrain a federal programmatic response to federal needs as they arise .
the current federal - aid highway program has been criticized for failing to link each state's funding with its performance in areas such as the cost - effectiveness of its highway construction efforts or the benefit / cost ratio of its projects .
in 1808 , secretary of the treasury albert gallatin recommended that the federal government provide $20 million over a ten - year period for a national network of canals and roads .
among the factors that mitigated against the plan was the view of southern states , which generally opposed federal grants for roads and canals , that spending would benefit other regions more than the south .
355 ) , which established the first federal aid for roads on a programmatic basis .
the debate over equity among donor and donee states has had a role in the shifting balance of control of and responsibility for highway spending between the federal government and the states .
the new england states , which had relatively good roads , opposed federal funding for roads because they expected the money would be spent for roads outside new england .
