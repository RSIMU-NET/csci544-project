the indian health service ( ihs ) is responsible for providing health care for over two million american indians and alaska natives ( ai / an ) who are members or descendants of federally recognized tribes .
in the years since the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) authorized states to expand access to medicaid and offer health insurance through the exchanges in 2014 , the percent of american indian and alaska native ( ai / an ) in the general population with health insurance has increased .
these facilities may also bill public programs such as medicaid ( the federal - state health insurance program for certain low - income individuals ) , medicare ( the federal health insurance program for persons aged 65 and over , and certain others ) , and the department of veterans affairs ( which provides health care services for veterans ) , as well as private insurance , for care provided to patients .
in addition , officials from two ihs area offices noted that prc has been able to pay for services such as patients' long - awaited knee and hip replacements , which have enabled patients to return to normal activities of life and reduce their need for pain management .
in february 2017 , gao added federal management of programs that serve indian tribes and their members to our high risk list because inadequate oversight hindered ihs's ability to ensure that indian communities have timely access to quality health care , among other reasons .
this ihs data reflect care provided through ihs - administered prc programs , which represented 39 percent of total prc appropriations in fiscal year 2018 ; similar data on the scope of care provided through tribally - administered prc programs , which account for the remaining portion of prc appropriations , were not available because such data are not required to be reported to ihs .
beginning in 2014 , the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) provided opportunities to expand coverage of ai / an through medicaid and private health insurance .
for example , medicaid collections grew 47 percent , from $496 million in fiscal year 2013 to $729 million in fiscal year 2018 .
in this report we describe , for fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , 1. trends in health insurance coverage among ai / an populations served by federally operated and tribally operated facilities as well as trends in third - party collections at these facilities , and 2. the effects of any changes in health insurance coverage and third - party collections on federally operated and tribally operated facilities .
you asked us to review how ppaca has affected ai / an access to health care .
health insurance may also provide ai / an with options to obtain care outside of federally operated or tribally operated facilities , including more comprehensive health services , if such options exist in their community .
medicaid collections accounted for 65 percent of the total $360 million increase , though collections from medicare , private insurance , and veterans affairs also increased during this period .
to describe trends in health insurance coverage among ai / an populations served by federally operated and tribally operated facilities , we analyzed ihs data representing the self - reported health insurance status of patients seeking care at all 73 federally operated ihs hospitals and health centers that were in operation from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 .
