many analysts , policy makers , and politicians argue that the u.s. health care system would perform better if market or market - like institutions played a larger role .
government intervention may enhance economic efficiency , although in other cases government action may exacerbate market failure .
the special characteristics of health care often lead to market failures .
the extent of government activity vis - a - vis the health system is seen by many economists and health care analysts as a policy response to the inequalities and inefficiencies associated with such market failures .
the report provides an overview of efforts to expand the use of market or market - like institutions in health care and considers effects of these initiatives or proposals on the federal budget .
this report explains what well - grounded economic theory has to say about the limits and capabilities of the market in the health care sector .
these conditions essentially state that consumption or production by one person does not affect others , that no one has a privileged position in the market , and that property rights are well - defined .
nonetheless , improving the performance and efficiency of the health system presents significant policy and political challenges even to well - designed reforms .
the challenge for those who wish to expand the use of market incentives in health care is to design policies that align material incentives facing consumers and providers of health care so that changes in behavior enhance economic efficiency .
reforms that are designed to address sources of market failure have better chances of enhancing economic performance than those that are not .
this view is based on the belief held by economists that markets generally work most efficiently when left alone , provided that certain conditions are met .
these limits and capabilities then outline what the government can or cannot do to improve the health care system's performance .
even if some view market forces and the use of the price system to allocate health care services as an intrusion , consumers and providers of health care are strongly affected by economic incentives .
both friends and foes of the expanding role of markets have sometimes relied on crude ideas about what markets can or cannot accomplish .
health care professionals often view a market orientation as a threat to their traditions , ethics , and culture .
consumers use less health care when they must pay a larger share of the cost .
physicians increased the volume ( i.e. , number of patient visits ) and intensity of patient care ( i.e. , number or complexity of services provided in an average visit ) seen after reductions in medicare part b payments .
if those conditions are violated , however , markets may function inefficiently , which is what economists call "market failure. .
dissatisfaction with the performance of the u.s. health care system has spurred wider interest in using market or market - like institutions to generate better results and lower costs .
absent the political will to increase taxes significantly , rising federal health care expenditures will force major cuts in benefits or fundamental changes in the health delivery system .
a bottom - line mentality , they argue , cannot deliver the same high quality of care as the so - called traditional approach based on professional ethics and responsibilities .
