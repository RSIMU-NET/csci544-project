several federal agencies are involved in analyzing the problem , including the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , and the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
hypoxia refers to a depressed concentration of dissolved oxygen in water .
in addition , spawning areas and other essential habitat can be destroyed by the lack of oxygen .
one model suggests that a 12% to 14% reduction in the use of fertilizer on croplands in the mississippi river basin would reduce the net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs by about 30% , without any loss in crop production .
legislation was enacted by the 105 th congress to provide additional authority and funding for research and monitoring to address these concerns .
although the extent of effects of hypoxic events on u.s. coastal ecosystems is still uncertain , the phenomenon is of increasing concern in coastal areas .
mortality is especially likely for sedentary species .
strategies selected focus on encouraging voluntary , practical , and cost - effective actions ; using existing programs , including existing state and federal regulatory mechanisms ; and following adaptive management .
decreased concentrations of dissolved oxygen result in part from natural eutrophication when nutrients ( e.g. , nitrogen and phosphorus ) and sunlight stimulate algal growth ( e.g. , algae , seaweed , and phytoplankton ) , increasing the amount of organic matter in an aquatic ecosystem over decades and centuries .
legislation has been introduced in the 110 th congress to reauthorize and amend the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act .
noaa initiated the nutrient enhanced coastal ocean productivity ( necop ) program in 1989 to study the effects of nutrient discharges on u.s. coastal waters .
while definitions vary somewhat by region , it is generally agreed that hypoxia in a marine environment occurs seasonally when dissolved oxygen levels fall below 2-3 milligrams per liter .
hypoxia is more likely to occur in coastal waters where the water column is stratified ( i.e. , layered ) because of differences in temperature or salinity or both .
as organisms die and sink to the bottom , they are consumed ( decomposed ) by oxygen - dependent bacteria , depleting the water of oxygen .
when this eutrophication is extensive and persistent , bottom waters may become hypoxic , or even anoxic ( no dissolved oxygen ) , while surface waters can be completely normal and full of life .
while some believe this problem may have no fast solutions and any management regime considered will need to recognize that progress or improvement may not be apparent for years or even decades , others suggest that improved agricultural practices in efficient application of chemical fertilizers and prevention of soil erosion could yield immediate and measurable benefits .
about 21% to 43% of the area of the united states' estuaries have experienced a hypoxic event ; more than half of the affected area is in the mississippi / atchafalaya river plume .
in the last few years , the u.s. department of agriculture's cooperative state research , education , and extension service has provided a special research grant of around $220,000 annually to iowa state university's leopold center for sustainable agriculture for a project to define and implement new methods and practices in farming that reduce impacts on water quality and the hypoxia problem in the gulf of mexico .
