the united republic of tanzania is an east african country of nearly 54 million people that is about twice as large as california .
the international monetary fund ( imf ) estimates it to have been the 31 st - poorest country globally in 2016 when ranked by per capita gross domestic product ( gdp ) , which stood at $970 in 2016 .
the country has substantial natural resource wealth and agricultural potential , however , and multiple socioeconomic development indicators have generally improved in recent years .
such concerns have centered on the nullification of the 2015 election results ( and the subsequent rerun in 2016 ) in the semiautonomous coastal region of zanzibar , restrictions on civil liberties , and similar issues .
since the 2015 elections , however , u.s. concerns about tanzania's governance have raised some tensions .
its relative political stability and government reforms have attracted substantial official development aid , although there are abiding concerns regarding corruption and a difficult business climate .
u.s. - tanzanian ties have generally been cordial and u.s. aid expanded significantly under the last two u.s .
citing such concerns , in march 2016 , the u.s. millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) board announced it would suspend its partnership with tanzania , deferring a vote on the country's continued eligibility for a potential second large development compact ; this effectively ended , for the time being , the development of a second mcc compact with tanzania , following its completion of an initial compact between 2008 and 2013 .
despite such challenges , some sectors of the economy , most notably the extractive industries , are attracting private investment .
president john magufuli was elected in 2015 and is serving his first five - year term in office .

the bulk of u.s. development aid for tanzania in recent years has been provided under obama administration presidential development initiatives , including feed the future ( ftf ) , the global health initiative , the global climate change initiative , power africa , and trade africa .
the mcc had previously authorized and helped fund initial research and concept design activities focused on the development of a second compact , which had been expected to center on the electrical power sector â€” and in mid - 2015 had informed congress of its intent to negotiate such a compact tanzania .
tanzania may also benefit from the fact that mark green , the new usaid administrator , is a former u.s. ambassador to the country ( 2007 to 2009 ) .
in 2014 tanzania was selected as one of six initial partner countries under the obama administration's african peacekeeping rapid response partnership ( aprrp ) .
these developments ran counter to a prior narrative of improving governance and economic development in tanzania and closer u.s. ties , underscored by former president obama's july 2013 visit to the country , during which he highlighted such progress , as well as growing u.s. trade and investment ties .
in recent years , tanzania has been the second - or third - largest annual recipient of such aid in sub - saharan africa , with funding reaching a high of $634.1 million in fy2015 and a low of $546.6 million in fy2017 ( provisional current estimate ; see table 1 ) .
