the department of health and human services' food and drug administration ( fda ) has responsibility for ensuring the safety of seafood imports .
the united states has increased the amount of seafood it imports over the past 10 years , currently importing seafood from approximately 130 countries .
we did not address the remaining practices: ( 1 ) define and articulate a common outcome ; ( 2 ) establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies ; ( 3 ) agree on roles and responsibilities ; ( 4 ) develop mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results ; ( 5 ) reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts ; and ( 6 ) reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts .
to better ensure the safety of seafood imports , we recommend that the secretary of health and human services direct the commissioner of fda to take the following three actions: study the feasibility of adopting other practices used by other entities , such as requiring foreign countries that want to export seafood to the united states to develop a national residues monitoring plan to control the use of aquaculture drugs , to more efficiently ensure the safety of imported seafood and report its findings to the secretary ; develop a more comprehensive import sampling program for seafood by more effectively using its laboratory resources and taking into account the imported seafood sampling programs of other entities and countries ; and develop a strategic approach with specific time frames for enhancing collaborative efforts with nmfs and better leveraging nmfs inspection resources .
specifically , this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) fda's program is able to ensure the safety of seafood imports against residues from unapproved drugs and ( 2 ) fda and nmfs have implemented the 2009 mou to enhance federal oversight of seafood and leverage federal resources .
we provided the departments of agriculture , commerce , and health and human services ( hhs ) a draft of this report for their review and comment .
according to estimates from the department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration , in 2010 more than 80 percent of seafood consumed in the united states — such as shrimp , salmon , and tilapia — was imported , with about half coming from aquaculture ( fish farming ) .
provisions in the new food safety legislation also provide fda with more specific direction and opportunity for greater collaboration with nmfs through , in part , more effective use of its inspection resources or results .
because fish grown in confined aquacultured areas can have high rates of bacterial infections , farmers may treat them with drugs , such as antibiotics and antifungal agents , to increase their survival rates .
furthermore , although fda worked effectively with nmfs in ensuring the safety of domestic seafood during the gulf of mexico oil spill , it lacks systematic collaboration with that agency .
according to the department of health and human services' food and drug administration's ( fda ) 2008 report to congress , the residues of some drugs can cause cancer , allergic reactions , and antibiotic resistance when consumed by humans .
further , fda will work with nmfs to develop strategic approaches for enhancing collaboration and better leveraging seafood inspection resources .
