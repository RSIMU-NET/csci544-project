our specific objectives were to identify ( 1 ) critical success factors in building information - sharing relationships and ( 2 ) related challenges and how to address them .
accordingly , the federal government's strategy for protecting the nation's critical computer - dependent infrastructure sectors includes efforts to establish information sharing and analysis centers ( isacs ) within both the federal government and individual industry sectors .
these factors included ( 1 ) fostering trust and respect ; ( 2 ) establishing effective , timely , and appropriately secure communication ; ( 3 ) obtaining top management support ; ( 4 ) ensuring organization leadership continuity ; and ( 5 ) generating clearly identifiable membership benefits .
information sharing and coordination are key elements in developing comprehensive and practical approaches to defending against computer - based , or cyber , attacks , which could threaten the national welfare .
the importance of sharing information and coordinating the response to cyber threats among various stakeholders has increased as our government and our nation have become ever more reliant on interconnected computer systems to support critical operations and infrastructures , such as telecommunications , power distribution , financial services , national defense , and critical government operations .
implementation of such provisions , as well as other monitoring actions , could facilitate information sharing and , thus , federal and private efforts to protect critical infrastructures .
to identify practices that could be adopted by federal agencies and others to ( 1 ) promote successful sharing of information on computer - based vulnerabilities and incidents and ( 2 ) overcome related challenges , we studied 11 organizations experienced in developing pertinent information - sharing relationships and procedures .
prior to 2000 , the congress held important hearings on year 2000 readiness , and , in 1998 , passed legislation intended to address concerns from private - sector entities about exposure to legal liability and antitrust law violations that might arise due to sharing information on year 2000 readiness .
the congress is currently considering measures intended to address several of the practices and challenges we identified .
computer - based incidents , such as the iloveyou virus in may 2000 and the recent code red , sircam , and nimda attacks , have caused significant disruptions and damage .
such attacks could severely disrupt computer - supported operations , compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information , and diminish the integrity of critical data .
information on threats and incidents experienced by others can help stakeholders identify trends , better understand the risks they face , and determine what preventative measures should be implemented .
for example , the congress can actively monitor progress in meeting critical infrastructure protection goals , including improved information sharing , and promote trust by assisting in clarifying the way federal agencies may use sensitive information provided for critical infrastructure protection purposes .
such analysis centers can use comprehensive , timely information on incidents to determine the nature of an attack , provide warnings , and advise on how to mitigate an imminent attack .
as the government's critical infrastructure protection strategy evolves , both public and private - sector entities can adopt the practices described to establish trusted relationships with a wide variety of federal and nonfederal entities that may be in a position to provide potentially useful information and advice on vulnerabilities and incidents ; develop standards and agreements on how shared information will be establish effective and appropriately secure communication take steps to ensure that sensitive information is not inappropriately disseminated , which may require statutory changes ; ensure that benefits are realized by developing and maintaining staff with the skills to support analytical capabilities and facilitate communication among information - sharing partners ; obtain the support of senior officials in both federal and nonfederal obtain adequate funding .
