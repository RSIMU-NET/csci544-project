we recommend that the secretary of labor take steps to ( 1 ) better utilize information in labor's database , such as indicators of program performance , for management oversight , particularly for apprenticeship programs in occupations with expected future labor shortages ; ( 2 ) develop a cost - effective strategy for collecting data from council - monitored states ; ( 3 ) conduct labor's reviews of apprenticeship activities in states that regulate their own programs on a regular basis to ensure that state activities are in accord with labor's requirements for recognition of apprenticeship programs ; and ( 4 ) offer substantive feedback to states from its reviews .
specifically , we assessed ( 1 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of labor monitors the operations and outcomes of registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , ( 2 ) its oversight activities for council - monitored states , and ( 3 ) the outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions in relation to those sponsored by employers alone .
our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of labor monitors the operations and outcomes of registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , ( 2 ) its oversight activities for council - monitored states , and ( 3 ) outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions in relation to those sponsored by employers alone .
it has granted 27 other states , the district of columbia , and 3 territories authority to register and oversee their own programs , and ensures programs comply with federal standards and meet additional state standards .
the national registered apprenticeships system , administered by the office of apprenticeship training , employer and labor services ( oatels ) within the department of labor , has an important role in the development of this skilled workforce .
the anticipated shortage of skilled construction workers has heightened concerns about the relationship between program outcomes and program quality , the prospect for expanding the supply of skilled workers through apprenticeships , and labor's oversight of these programs .
we also visited four states , both federal ( texas ) and council - monitored ( california , new york , and washington ) , that had large numbers of construction apprentices ( from about 52,000 to 6,500 ) .
in addition , some have raised concerns that the failure to complete programs could be indicative of poor program quality .
with a budget of $21 million , oatels promulgates standards to safeguard the welfare of apprentices and registers apprenticeship programs that meet those standards , which include requirements for related instruction , on - the - job training , and equal employment opportunity for apprentices .
between 2002 and 2012 an estimated 850,000 jobs will open in the construction industry , but experts predict that there will not be enough skilled workers to fill them .
labor has infrequently reviewed states to which it has delegated oversight responsibility .
while labor and apprenticeship councils provide oversight , recent studies have shown that a significant number of construction apprentices are not completing their programs and that construction programs sponsored by employers without union participation have lower completion rates and wages for apprentices .
