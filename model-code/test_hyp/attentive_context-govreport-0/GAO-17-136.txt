to ensure that the elements of the agency's process for making asset maintenance decisions are achieving desired outcomes , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director of the park service to evaluate the capital investment strategy and its results to determine if it is achieving its intended outcomes or if changes need to be made .
the national park service ( park service ) , within the department of the interior , manages more than 75,000 assets — including buildings , roads , and water systems — at 413 park units that cover 84 million acres across all 50 states , the district of columbia , and some territories .
however , evaluating the capital investment strategy and its results in a few years may allow the park service to determine if the strategy is achieving its intended outcomes or if changes need to be made .
as of september 30 , 2015 , the park service estimated that its deferred maintenance had grown to about $11.9 billion .
in recent years , reports prepared by the park service and stakeholder groups have highlighted challenges that the park service faces — particularly fiscal challenges — and the park service has reported that its funding does not cover the cost of its mission to preserve the parks for current and future generations to enjoy .
maintenance allocation data from fiscal year 2015 are the most current data available .
in a 2013 testimony before congress , the director of the park service said that the organization faced a maintenance backlog of about $11.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 2012 and would need to spend nearly $700 million per year on deferred maintenance to keep the backlog from continuing to grow .
with the park service celebrating its centennial in 2016 and park visits at an all - time high , policymakers and others have expressed concern about the condition of park units and the amount of park service deferred maintenance .
to examine how much the park service has allocated to maintain assets in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 , we obtained and analyzed maintenance allocation data from the park service for that period .
the park service has allocated $1.16 billion on average to maintain its assets in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 , but its deferred maintenance has continued to increase .
