this report describes ( 1 ) what has been reported in state and local governments' comprehensive annual financial reports ( cafr ) about unfunded opeb liabilities , ( 2 ) actions state and local governments have taken to address the liabilities associated with retiree health benefits , and ( 3 ) the overall fiscal pressures these governments face .
when state and local governments ( referred to in this report as governments ) provide health benefits to their retired employees , they may do so by paying for a portion of the costs of these benefits .
given concerns about state and local governments' fiscal challenges and the potential erosion of retiree health benefits , you asked us for information on state and local governments' retiree health liabilities .
governments have typically funded their share of the cost of retiree health benefits when they are paid or provided to retirees ( i.e. , during retirement ) , as opposed to during active employment .
to describe state and local governments' unfunded opeb liabilities , we reviewed the most recent cafrs for the 50 states and 39 large local governments ( cities and counties with total revenue of $2 billion or more according to u.s. census bureau data ) .
under accounting standards issued in 2004 , governments are required to account for the costs of postemployment benefits other than pensions — referred to as other postemployment benefits ( opeb ) — as employees earn the benefits and the costs are accrued , not when the benefits are paid or provided .
the model's results are not a prediction of future decisions on government policies ; in the face of growing fiscal pressure , changes in policies are likely .
to describe what is reported about state and local governments' unfunded other postemployment benefits ( opeb ) liabilities , we reviewed the most recent governmentwide comprehensive annual financial reports ( cafr ) , as of june 30 , 2009 , for the states and selected local governments .
this has raised concerns about the fiscal pressures that state and local governments will face in the coming decades and leads to questions about the actions state and local governments can take to address their opeb liabilities , such as changing their retiree health benefits .
additionally , reporting of governments' opeb liabilities has brought renewed focus on how governments will address these liabilities .
such changes could include reductions in health care benefits , reductions in the number of retirees receiving benefits , increases in state and local taxes , or a combination of these .
in general , state and local retiree benefits are not subject to federal laws governing private sector retiree benefits .
while the standards include requirements for the reporting of governments' opeb liabilities , they do not include requirements for funding opeb , such as retiree health benefits .
because state and local governments have historically funded retiree health benefits when paid or provided rather then when the benefits are earned , much of their opeb liability may be unfunded .
under the accounting standards , fiscal year 2008 was generally the first year that the largest governments were to begin reporting , in annual financial statements , the amount of government's obligation to employees who have earned opeb ; these amounts are known as opeb liabilities .
