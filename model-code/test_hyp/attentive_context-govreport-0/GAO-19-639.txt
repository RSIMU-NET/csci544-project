 ( recommendation 5 ) .
the u.s. airspace system is one of the safest in the world , but incidents and near misses at and around u.s. airport runways and taxiways still occur .
what efforts have faa and others implemented to improve terminal area safety , and how does faa assess their effectiveness ? .
you asked us to review faa's safety oversight of airport terminal areas — runways , taxiways , and ramp areas ( the area from the gate to the taxiway or runway , where aircraft are prepared for departure and arrival ) — and update our prior work , including our 2011 report on terminal area safety .
faa's guidance on the runway safety program states that faa may evaluate the effectiveness of its runway safety programs , and the extent to which they are helping faa meet its safety goals .
in addition , in fiscal year 2018 , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) recorded over 1,800 incidents of planes , vehicles , or pedestrians entering runways when they were not authorized to do so .
 ( recommendation 4 ) 5 .
faa data show runway incidents nearly doubled between fiscal years 2011 and 2018 .
to address both objectives , we reviewed our prior work and other published work on faa's runway and taxiway safety efforts , including those from faa , the department of transportation's ( dot ) inspector general , and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) .
 ( recommendation 1 ) 2 .
 ( recommendation 2 ) 3 .
to identify faa's and other stakeholders' efforts , including technologies , to improve terminal area safety and determine how faa assesses their effectiveness , we reviewed documentation of faa , airports' and airlines' current or planned terminal area initiatives .
despite these efforts , reported runway incidents have continued to increase .
since establishing runway safety as a strategic objective in 2002 , faa has undertaken many efforts to address this issue , including collecting and sharing information on incidents and deploying technologies that can alert air traffic controllers of potential collisions .
faa has taken steps to improve terminal area safety , but has not assessed the effectiveness of many of its runway and taxiway safety efforts .
we also found that faa may be missing opportunities to improve its terminal - area safety efforts , including improving communication within faa .
additionally , faa has implemented a data - driven , risk - based safety oversight approach that is designed to identify hazards , manage risks , and take corrective action before an accident occurs .
in some instances , faa has taken steps to evaluate its terminal - area safety efforts .
in addition , establishing a plan to evaluate all of its runway and taxiway safety efforts would help faa direct its resources toward activities and technologies proven to enhance safety and identify ways to strengthen those efforts .
the runway safety manager should establish a plan to assess the effectiveness of all of faa's terminal area - safety efforts , including airport surface detection equipment , model x ( asde - x ) and the runway safety program .
 ( recommendation 3 ) 4 .
by assessing the effectiveness of its primary efforts , faa may be better positioned to make decisions about how to target its limited resources within and among these efforts .
