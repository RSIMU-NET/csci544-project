the department of justice ( doj ) was created in june 1870 , with the attorney general as its head .
since its establishment , doj has expanded to include 40 agencies .
the major investigative agencies — the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) — prevent and deter crime and arrest offenders .
doj oig lists grant management as a management challenge because ( 1 ) oig reviews continue to find that many grantees do not submit financial and progress reports ; ( 2 ) numerous deficiencies continue to be found in the cops office's monitoring of grantee activities ; ( 3 ) audits found that grants were not regularly awarded in a timely manner and grantees were slow to spend funds ; and ( 4 ) more than 375 audits of cops grants have resulted in significant dollar - related findings .
a 2003 oig audit of ojp and cops grant programs found ( 1 ) a structural overlap between the cops office and ojp ; ( 2 ) an overlap in grant programs between the cops office and ojp ; ( 3 ) a lack of on - line grant application processing in the cops office ; ( 4 ) an overlap in ojp's organization structure ; and ( 5 ) inefficiencies in ojp's automated grant management systems .
congress attempted to address some of these issues when it passed the violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act of 2005 ( p.l .
the united states attorneys office prosecutes offenders and represents the federal government in court .
for years , some have questioned the effectiveness of doj grant programs and have called for program evaluations .
the office of justice programs ( ojp ) , the community oriented policing services ( cops ) office , and the office of violence against women ( ovw ) , provide grant funds to state , local , and tribal governments for crime prevention and intervention programs as well as funding for criminal justice system improvement programs .
marshals service ( usms ) provides protection to the federal judiciary , apprehends fugitives , and detains people in federal custody .
the bureau of prisons ( bop ) provides confinement and supervision for convicted federal offenders .
this report does not discuss any other discretionary grant programs administered by ojp and cops , nor does it discuss the justice assistance grant program ( jag ) , any grant program administered by the office on violence against women ( ovw ) , any grant program administered by the office of victims of crime ( ovc ) , or ojp and cops grant programs that have traditionally received funding through earmarks .
the government accountability office ( gao ) assessed six evaluations of five drug courts and found mixed results .
since 2000 , doj oig has identified grant management as one of doj's top ten management challenges .
the administration responded by requiring federal agencies to submit strategic and annual performance plans and report on program performance .
