the military health services system ( mhss ) provides for the mental health care needs of the approximately 1.7 million active - duty members of the u.s. armed services .
to meet its military readiness requirements , the mhss had 478 psychiatrists and 395 clinical psychologists on board in fiscal year 1996 .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 ( p.l .
some of these problems have been resolved .
given dod's readiness requirements , the pdp's substantial cost and questionable benefits , and the project's persistent implementation difficulties , we see no reason to reinstate this demonstration project .
in the future , should prescribing psychologists be needed to meet dod's medical readiness requirements , the congress should require dod to ( 1 ) clearly demonstrate that the use of those mhss psychologists who have been trained to prescribe has resulted in savings , ( 2 ) clearly define a prescribing psychologist's role and scope of practice in the mhss compared with other psychologists and psychiatrists , ( 3 ) design a curriculum appropriate to this role and scope of practice , and ( 4 ) determine the need for and the level of supervision that prescribing psychologists require .
on the basis of discussions with your offices , our evaluation includes ( 1 ) an assessment of the need for prescribing psychologists in the mhss , ( 2 ) information on the implementation of the pdp , and ( 3 ) information on the pdp's costs and benefits .
although dod met the mandate to establish a demonstration project to train military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication for mental illness , the pdp implementation faced several problems .
dod .
each of the three services has a model and procedures to determine the number of specific types of health care providers needed to support its mhss medical readiness mission .
these include delays in granting prescribing privileges and disagreements over the extent of supervision .
we also examined the results of a vri survey of dod health care providers that collected information on providers' perceptions of pdp's benefits .
the implementation faced several problems , however , that persisted for the pdp's duration .
seven have completed it .
because no medical training is required to practice clinical psychology , clinical psychologists , whether in the military or the civilian sector , historically have not been permitted to prescribe drugs .
each service has more than enough psychiatrists , as well as clinical psychologists , to care for its anticipated wartime psychiatric caseload .
about one out of eight casualties would involve combat stress , according to an army official.caring for combat stress requires skill in ( 1 ) diagnosing combat stress , including the ability to distinguish it from neurological or other psychological disorders with like signs and symptoms , and ( 2 ) treating a range of severity levels of combat stress .
furthermore , although the pdp produced additional providers who can prescribe and some facilities have reported positive experiences with them , determining the pdp's cost - effectiveness is impossible at this time .
given this surplus , spending resources to provide psychologists with additional skill does not seem justified .
the pdp has trained military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication for mental conditions such as depressive and adjustment disorders .
