congress has enacted specific post - government employment restrictions designed to protect the u.s. government from the improper use of government information or other undue influence by former government employees .
this report discusses ( 1 ) the extent to which these agencies collect and maintain information on the post - government employment activities of these officials and ( 2 ) the key challenges the agencies face in enforcing post - government employment restrictions and fara requirements .
to enhance justice's ability to ensure that the american people know the identity of persons trying to influence u.s. government policy in the united states on behalf of foreign entities , congress may wish to consider ( 1 ) granting the department of justice civil investigative demand authority to inspect records of persons justice believes should be registered as foreign agents and ( 2 ) requiring persons claiming certain exemptions to provide advance written notification to justice before engaging in the exempt activities .
our past work has found problems with the u.s. government's implementation of these laws .
we maintain that congress consider the proposed legislative changes to enhance justice's ability to ensure that the american people know the identity of persons trying to influence u.s. government policy .
the office of government ethics ( oge ) and executive branch agencies have implemented regulations and procedures to inform employees about the restrictions .
in addition to these laws and other lobbying disclosure requirements , such as the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as amended , congress has enacted the foreign agents registration act ( fara ) to ensure that the u.s. government and the american people are informed of the source and identity of persons engaging in representational activities or otherwise trying to influence u.s. government policy on behalf of foreign entities .
we also interviewed officials at selected executive branch agencies that work on issues directly related to bilateral relations , including the departments of state ( state ) and the treasury ( treasury ) , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the office of united states trade representative ( ustr ) , and analyzed documents at those agencies to understand how the agencies notify employees of post - government employment restrictions .
in addition , justice officials have cited a lack of clear legal authority and a lack of resources as barriers to monitoring compliance with fara registration requirements .
for example , the restrictions include a ban , for 1 year , on all senior and very senior employees of federal agencies , members of congress , and congressional staff from performing certain representational or advocacy activities on behalf of a foreign government , before any u.s. government official , with the intent to influence a decision of the government official .
the restrictions prohibit federal employees from engaging in certain activities , such as lobbying or other advocacy communications , for a specified period of time after leaving federal service .
in 1990 , we reported that justice had not implemented a 1980 gao recommendation to seek authority to ( 1 ) give the justice department additional enforcement measures , including administrative subpoena powers , and ( 2 ) require individuals to submit written notification of all exemption claims prior to engaging in the representation of a foreign principal .
