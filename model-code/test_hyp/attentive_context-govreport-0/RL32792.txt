this report considers population longevity in the united states , as measured by life expectancy .
life expectancy is the expected number of years to be lived , on average , by a particular cohort , if current mortality trends continue for the rest of that cohort's life .
it most commonly refers to life expectancy at birth , the median number of years that a population born in a particular year could expect to live .
this tells us that , for those born in calendar year 2003 in the united states , 50% will die before that age ; the other half will live longer .
in the united states , data on mortality are collected and compiled through the vital statistics system by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) / national center for health statistics ( nchs ) .
in addition , it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years .
there is a lively debate among researchers regarding whether the biological limits of life spans have been reached or whether future increases are probable .
while this report concentrates on trends and differentials in life expectancy at birth , appendix b table b - 2 provides estimates of life expectancy at selected additional ages in 2003 ( the most recent final data available ) .
what program changes are required to ensure the continued viability of such programs as the number of beneficiaries increases ? .
while this report focuses on describing the demographic context of longevity change in the united states , these trends have implications for a wide range of social and economic issues that are likely to be considered by congress .
for instance , one consequence of lengthening life expectancies is that the older population's needs for careâassistance with daily tasks to allow continued community - living for high - functioning seniors , institutions for those with more severe disabilities or cognitive impairments , training of a specialized work force in geriatric careâare likely to increase , particularly for the oldest - old .
at the same time , there is the recognition that government programs , such as social security and medicare , will face financial pressures to meet the increasing needs .
life expectancy at age 60 in the year 2003 was 22.2 years in the united states .
what will be the federal government's role in an environment of competing demands for limited resources ? .
according to the u.s. census bureau , international data base , the highest attained life expectancy to date for a national population was that of andorra in 2006 , when life expectancy was 83.5 years for the total population ( 86.6 years for females ; 80.6 years for males ) .
for instance , based on recently released final data , life expectancy at birth in 2003 was 77.5 years .
measures of life expectancy are published in official life tables , which are based on age - specific death rates .
this report documents the improvements in life expectancy that have occurred , analyzing both the underlying factors that contributed to mortality reductions as well as the continuing longevity differentials by sex and race .
life expectancy at age 60 , for instance , refers to the additional number of years that a person who has already attained age 60 will live beyond age 60 .
