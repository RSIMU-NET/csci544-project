with a staff of 64,000 , ssa administers the nation's largest federal program — social security — as well as the largest cash welfare program , supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
in that report , we highlighted the challenges that ssa would face as an independent agency: the shortfall in funds to pay future social security benefits , growing and changing disability caseloads , and public concerns about ssi program growth .
i am pleased to be here today to provide our assessment of the social security administration's ( ssa ) efforts to address policy and program issues and to prepare for managing the challenges it faces in the 21st century .
ssa's expenditures totaled $363 billion in fiscal year 1995 , nearly one - fourth of this nation's $1.5 trillion federal budget .
today , i will describe these policy and program challenges and assess ssa's progress in addressing them and in preparing to manage its future challenges .
yet as ssa acknowledges , public confidence in its programs is low and has been low for some time .
although much of this lack of confidence stems from concerns about the future solvency of the social security system , public confidence is also eroded by reports of fraud and abuse .
in establishing ssa's independence , the congress recognized the importance of strong and stable leadership for the agency .
as we noted in our february 1995 report on ssa's transition to independence , independence heightens the importance of ssa's playing a strong leadership role in addressing long - standing problems and preparing for future challenges .
has not sufficiently promoted return - to - work efforts in the administration and design of its disability programs .
i will also assess what additional actions are needed to help ssa meet these challenges .
social security provides benefits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors ; ssi provides assistance to the needy aged , blind , and disabled .
any failure to do so seriously undermines the public's confidence in government and its ability to efficiently and cost - effectively administer programs and protect taxpayer dollars .
at this critical juncture , effective leadership is needed so the agency can take the following actions to better ensure its success in the 21st century: inform the national debate on social security financing issues , complete its redesign of the disability claims process and promote return to work in its disability programs , enhance efforts to ensure program integrity , and make the technology enhancements and workforce decisions needed to meet increasing workloads with fewer resources .
in addition , ssa has not done enough to combat fraud and abuse in the ssi program and address program weaknesses .
these observations are drawn from completed and ongoing gao work on social security issues .
ssa faces significant challenges , however , in modernizing its information systems — a complex , multiyear effort that could easily cost billions of dollars .
we also spoke with ssa officials , selected officials of the social security advisory council and advisory board , and other experts to determine ssa's progress so far , what problems remain , and what else is needed to make ssa a premier agency .
