the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventi ons and administers the registration of trademarks .
it also assists other federal departments and agencies to protect american intellectual property in the international marketplace .
under the new statute , the use of fees generated is still subject to the appropriations process whereby congress provides the budget authority for the uspto to spend these fees .
in addition , the new law grants the uspto authority "to set or adjust by rule any fee established or charged by the office" under certain provisions of the patent and trademark laws .
proponents of the withholding approach to funding the uspto claimed that despite the ability of the appropriators to impose limits on spending current year fee collections , the office was provided with sufficient financial support to operate .
under the america invents act , the budget authority to use fees collected by the uspto remains within the congressional appropriations process .
112-29 , the leahy - smith america invents act , makes several changes to the handling of fees generated by the uspto .
the act requires that "patent and trademark fee amounts are in the aggregate set to recover the estimated cost to the office for processing , activities , services and materials relating to patents and trademarks , respectively , including proportionate shares of the administrative costs of the office. .
it remains to be seen how this new approach addresses the issues associated with the operations of the uspto and the use of those fees collected within a given fiscal year .
critics argued that , over time , a significant portion of the fees collected were not returned to the uspto due to the ceilings established by the appropriations process and the inability of the office to use the fees on a dollar - for - dollar basis .
the uspto is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as "offsetting collections" and subject to spending limits established by the committee on appropriations .
beginning in 1990 , appropriations measures have , at times , limited the ability of the u.s. patent and trademark office to use the full amount of fees collected in each fiscal year .
this appears to provide the uspto with greater flexibility to adjust its fee schedule absent congressional intervention .
these funds will be available to the uspto "to the extent and in the amounts provided in appropriations acts" and may only be used for the work of the uspto .
they claimed that all fees were necessary to cover actual , time - dependent activities at the uspto and that the ability of the appropriators to limit funds severely diminished the efficient and effective operation of the office .
fees generated above the amount provided in the appropriations legislation are to be put into a special fund and are restricted to use solely by the patent and trademark office .
an additional issue was raised in regard to the fy2013 sequestration of fees paid to the uspto .
however , to address the issue of fees withheld from the office in the past , the america invents act creates within the treasury a "patent and trademark fee reserve fund" into which fee collections above that "appropriated by the office for that fiscal year" will be placed .
