as requested , after providing some context about records management in the federal government and the roles of federal agencies and the national archives and records administration ( nara ) , my statement will focus on describing the challenges of electronic records management and potential means of addressing these challenges .
as you are aware , federal agencies are increasingly using electronic means to create , exchange , and store information , and in doing so , they frequently create federal records .
i appreciate the opportunity to discuss critical issues surrounding electronic records management in the federal government .
according to the federal records act , federal records are information in whatever form that documents government functions , activities , decisions , and other important transactions , and such records must be managed and preserved in accordance with the act .
strong indications from the congress that records management needs more attention could also raise the priority among agency management .
accordingly , we recommended that it develop a strategy for conducting systematic inspections of agency records management programs to ( 1 ) periodically assess agency progress in improving records management programs and ( 2 ) evaluate the efficacy of nara's governmentwide guidance .
 ( a transition to electronic recordkeeping was under way at one of the four agencies , and two had long - term plans to use electronic recordkeeping. ) .
however , we concluded that the new approach that nara initiated ( targeted assistance ) did not provide systematic and comprehensive information for assessing progress over time .
we attributed weaknesses in agency e - mail management ( such as senior officials not conforming to regulations ) to factors including insufficient training and oversight regarding recordkeeping practices ( as well as the onerousness of handling large volumes of e - mail ) â€” similar to the effects of low priority described by sra .
accordingly , to ensure that they have appropriate recordkeeping systems with which to manage and preserve their records , agencies are required to develop records management programs .
nara concluded that the varying levels of agency compliance with its records management regulations and policies have implications for the government's effectiveness and efficiency in conducting its business , protecting citizens' rights , assuring government accountability , and preserving our national history .
the federal records act gave nara responsibility for oversight of agency records management programs by , among other functions , making it responsible for conducting inspections or surveys of agencies' records and records management programs and practices ; conducting records management studies ; and reporting the results of these activities to the congress and omb .
without adequate and readily accessible documentation , agencies may not have access to important operational information to make decisions and carry out their missions .
also significant is the push for open government , which , by heightening the importance of agencies' providing information to the public , makes information a more central part of their missions and could help highlight the actual importance to agencies of actively managing their information .
accordingly , we recommended that agencies with weaknesses in oversight , policies , and practices develop and apply oversight practices , such as reviews and monitoring of records management training and practices , that would be adequate to ensure that policies were effective and that staff were adequately trained and were implementing policies appropriately .
