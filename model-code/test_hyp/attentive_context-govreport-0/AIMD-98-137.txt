this act creates the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , a fixed federal funding stream that replaces the aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program and a number of welfare programs in which federal funding matched state spending and increased automatically with caseloads .
specifically , you asked us to report on ( 1 ) how state budgetary resources , including federal aid , have been allocated since states have had access to tanf funds , ( 2 ) what plans states are making to assure programmatic stability in times of fiscal and economic stress , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states have used , or plan to use , the program's federal contingency fund and the loan fund which are available for downturns or other emergencies affecting states .
in 1996 the congress made sweeping changes to national welfare policy in passing public law 104-193 , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) .
this report is part of a series of gao work reviewing the implementation of federal welfare reform .
you asked us to review states' fiscal decisions for the tanf block grant and to address whether states are taking steps now to prepare for the effects of future economic downturns on their welfare programs .
in this report , we focus on the fiscal aspects of welfare reform .
in a related report , we responded to a request from you and the chairman of the senate committee on finance to monitor states' efforts to implement programs to meet the stated objectives of title i ( tanf ) of prwora .
in that report , we described states' efforts to require and encourage welfare recipients and potential recipients to assume greater personal responsibility , examined how states are providing services to support the objectives of tanf , and reviewed early reported data to assess states' progress .
currently authorized through federal fiscal year 2002 , the tanf block grant represents an entitlement to states of $16.5 billion annually .
prwora also creates two safety - net mechanisms for states to access additional federal resources in the event of a recession or other emergency — the $2 billion contingency fund for state welfare programs ( contingency fund ) and a $1.7 billion federal loan fund for state welfare programs ( loan fund ) .
states currently have more resources available for these programs under tanf than would have been available under the old financing system , but future fiscal demands are uncertain .
a number of factors unrelated to states' savings decisions have influenced the levels of these funds , including cash management practices , slow - starting programmatic spending , and caseload declines .
federal funding under the tanf grant is fixed , and states are required to maintain a significant portion of their own historic financial commitment to their welfare programs as a condition of receiving their full tanf grant — referred to as their maintenance of effort requirement ( moe ) .these two funding streams — federal tanf and state general funds for moe — represent the bulk of the resources available to states as they design , finance , and implement their new low - income family assistance programs .
