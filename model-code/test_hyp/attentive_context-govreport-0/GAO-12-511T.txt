my statement today focuses on initial observations from our ongoing review for this subcommittee and examines the status and management of ssa's efforts to ( 1 ) update its medical listings to reflect current medical knowledge and ( 2 ) develop its own occupational information system ( ois ) to reflect labor market changes .
in the last 20 years , ssa disability benefit payments to beneficiaries and their dependents have increased almost fivefold , from $35 billion in 1990 to over $164 billion in 2010 .
in addition , the ois should ( 1 ) meet ssa's legal , program , and data requirements ; ( 2 ) be flexible enough to incorporate changes in ssa's policies and processes ; and ( 3 ) be able to be updated to reflect the evolving workplace environment .
given the extensive size and cost of its disability programs , ssa must have current and appropriate criteria by which to assess whether an applicant's medical conditions affect his or her ability to perform work in the national economy .
gao has designated ssa's federal disability program as a high - risk area ; in 2008 , we reported that the agency's medical criteria did not fully reflect medical and technological advances , and the occupational criteria it used from the department of labor ( labor ) had not been updated since 1991 , despite the trend away from manual labor jobs and towards service - and knowledge - based jobs .
the number of working - age beneficiaries also grew from about 9 million in 2000 to almost 12 million in 2010 , and , as more baby boomers enter their disability - prone years , ssa expects the number of claims to grow .
we will also identify any mitigation strategies the agency may have to address project risks , such as the risk of the agency not receiving full funding .
to examine these issues we reviewed prior gao and ssa office of inspector general reports ; relevant federal laws and regulations ; program documentation including policies , procedures , strategic goals , and supporting project plans and cost estimates ; and position papers and testimonies from disability groups and commissions .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our preliminary observations on efforts by the social security administration ( ssa ) to modernize its disability criteria .
ssa administers two of the largest disability programs: the disability insurance ( di ) program , enacted in 1956 , and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , enacted in 1972 .
ssa continues to face delays in completing both comprehensive and other ongoing updates .
we will also review more broadly other steps ssa is taking to incorporate modern concepts of disability into its programs .
for example , ssa contracted with the institute of medicine to study its medical criteria for determining disability and to make recommendations for improving the timeliness and accuracy of its disability decisions , resulting in a 2007 report with recommendations and a symposium of experts in 2010 .
two of the remaining six body system listings — mental and neurological disorders , which are among those ssa uses most frequently in its eligibility determination process — have not been comprehensively revised for 27 years.to expire in 2012 .
