if , in making revisions to its manual , the board determines that statutory changes may be helpful to enhance board operations , then the board should also engage with stakeholders on such proposed changes .
although the board has undergone some changes since that time — such as designating the chief of the capitol police ( chief ) as a non - voting member in 2003 and adopting a manual of procedures ( manual ) in 2013 to document , among other things , its mission , purpose , and composition — according to some congressional stakeholders , accountability and communication challenges persist .
our report also outlines a number of options requiring statutory change , which could further address concerns about the board's operations , but could also pose new challenges .
to ensure that the capitol police board's current and any new approaches help enhance accountability , transparency , and effective external communication with its stakeholders , we recommend that the board revise its manual of procedures to fully incorporate each of the leading practices for internal control and governance standards discussed in this report .
in this report , we examine the following objectives: ( 1 ) what are the roles and responsibilities of the capitol police board ( board ) and the chief of the capitol police ( chief ) as set out in statute and in the board's manual of procedures and how does the board's scope compare to other law enforcement oversight entities ? .
what are congressional stakeholder perspectives on the degree to which the board is accountable , transparent , and effective in its communication approaches and what options exist to enhance the board's approaches ? .
the u.s. capitol police is responsible for protecting the congress , as well as its members , staff , visitors , and facilities so that it can fulfill its constitutional and legislative responsibilities in a safe , secure , and open environment .
thus , in 2002 we provided insights into the board's operations , internal controls , and standardized governance practices , as well as alternatives to the existing board's design .
identifying and communicating potential changes to its congressional stakeholders , and incorporating their views into the revision process , as appropriate , would help the board ensure that steps to revise its manual best address both the leading practices and chief stakeholder concerns .
these leading practices are: ( 1 ) defining roles , responsibilities , and areas of authority ; ( 2 ) overseeing functions of the corporation ; ( 3 ) conducting performance evaluations and reviews ; ( 4 ) developing processes for internal functions of the board ; ( 5 ) disclosing information to stakeholders ; and ( 6 ) developing processes for communication with stakeholders .
 ( 2 ) to what extent does the board's manual of procedures incorporate leading practices from internal control and other standardized governance principles to facilitate accountability , transparency , and effective external communication and in what ways is the board implementing these practices ? .
these options center on changes to the boards' scope and duties , its composition and size , and alternatives to congressional oversight of the board , among other things .
