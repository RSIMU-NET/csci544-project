specifically , nrc stated that the agency would consider gao's recommendations as part of the working groups the agency has established to evaluate ( 1 ) including category 3 sources in wbl and nsts , ( 2 ) license verification transfer requirements for category 3 sources , and ( 3 ) enhancing security and safety measures as part of the prelicensing process .
this report ( 1 ) examines what steps nrc and agreement states have taken since 2007 to ensure that radioactive materials licenses are granted only to legitimate organizations , and licensees can obtain materials only in quantities allowed by their licenses , and ( 2 ) presents the results of our covert vulnerability testing designed to test the effectiveness of these controls .
in addition , in 2005 , congress passed the energy policy act ( epact ) establishing a radiation source protection and security task force ( task force ) to make recommendations relating to the security of radiation sources in the united states from potential terrorist threats .
nrc retains its mandate to regulate the use of radioactive materials in the remaining 13 states ( nrc states ) .
as part of the ongoing efforts of nrc working groups meeting to develop enhancements to the prelicensing requirements for category 3 licenses , consider requiring that an on - site security review be conducted for all unknown applicants of category 3 licenses to verify that each applicant is prepared to implement the required security measures before taking possession of licensed radioactive materials .
in 2008 , we found that nrc had worked with the agreement states and others to ( 1 ) identify sealed sources of greatest concern , ( 2 ) enhance requirements to secure radioactive sources , and ( 3 ) ensure that security requirements were implemented .
specifically , in september 2007 , nrc approved its action plan to respond to recommendations to address security issues its and agreement states' radioactive materials programs raised in nrc inspector general , senate subcommittee , and gao reports .
in addition , we found that nrc had made progress toward implementing recommendations to ( 1 ) modify its process for issuing licenses to ensure that radioactive materials cannot be purchased by those with no legitimate need for them and ( 2 ) examine whether certain radioactive sources should be subject to more stringent regulations .
the atomic energy act gives the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) regulatory authority over domestic industrial , medical , and research uses of radioactive materials .
specifically , we recommend that the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) take the following three actions: take the steps needed to include category 3 sources in the national source tracking system and add agreement state category 3 licenses to the web - based licensing system as quickly as reasonably possible .
according to nrc officials , all agreement states have fully implemented compatible requirements to part 37 as of march 19 , 2016 ; state licensees operated under orders or other legally binding requirements in the interim .
adequate to protect public health and safety and minimize danger to life and property .
radioactive materials are commonly used throughout the world for a variety of purposes in medicine and the oil and gas , electric power , construction , and food industries .
