while the rapidly emerging field of nanotechnology is believed by many to offer significant economic and societal benefits , some research results have raised concerns about the potential environmental , health , and safety ( ehs ) implications of nanoscale materials .
a key issue before congress regarding nanotechnology is how best to protect human health , safety , and the environment as nanoscale materials and products are researched , developed , manufactured , used , and discarded .
this report identifies the potential environmental , health , and safety opportunities and challenges of nanotechnology ; explains the importance of addressing nanotechnology ehs concerns ; identifies and discusses nanotechnology ehs issues ; and summarizes several options for congressional action , including the nanotechnology ehs - related provisions of selected legislation .
potential tools the federal government might use to address these issues include research and development , regulation , and international engagement .
some of the properties of nanoscale materials ( e.g. , small size , high surface area - to - volume ratio ) that have given rise to great hopes for beneficial applications have also given rise to concerns about their potential adverse implications for the environment , and human health and safety .
these properties are believed by many to offer substantial economic and societal benefits .
nanotechnology — a term encompassing nanoscale science , engineering , and technology — is focused on understanding , controlling , and exploiting the unique properties of matter that can emerge at scales of one to 100 nanometers .
the nni is a multi - agency federal effort to coordinate and expand federal nanotechnology research and development ( r&d ) efforts .
such large investments and intensified efforts to capitalize on these public and private investments have caused some observers ( as detailed later in this report ) to suggest that there is insufficient information about the potential effects nanotechnology products and manufacturing processes may have on human health , safety , and the environment .
for more information on nanotechnology and the nni see , see crs report rl34401 , the national nanotechnology initiative: overview , reauthorization , and appropriations issues , crs report rl34493 , nanotechnology and u.s. competitiveness: issues and options , and crs report rl34614 , nanotechnology and environmental , health , and safety: issues for consideration , all by john f. sargent .
among the issues these stakeholders have identified are characterizing the toxicity of nanoscale materials ; developing methods for assessing and managing the risks of these materials ; and understanding how these materials move in , and interact with , the environment .
with more than 1,000 nanotechnology products reportedly commercially available , there is great interest in protecting the health and safety of the scientists working with nanoscale materials , workers who manufacture the products , consumers who use the products , and members of the general public who may be exposed to nanoparticles , as well as in understanding the environmental impact of nanomanufacturing processes and the use and disposal of nanotechnology products .
congressionally - mandated reviews of the nni by the national research council ( nrc ) and the president's council of advisors on science and technology ( pcast ) have concluded that additional research is required to make a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials .
