the federal government continues to face new and more complex challenges in the 21st century resulting from long - term fiscal constraints , changing demographics , and other factors .
leadership in agencies across the federal government , especially at senior executive levels , is essential to providing accountable , committed , consistent , and sustained attention to human capital and related organizational transformation issues .
as requested , this report updates our january 2003 report and provides information ( 1 ) on the representation of women and minorities in the ses and the ses developmental pool ( i.e. , gs - 15 and gs - 14 positions ) for the executive branch as of fiscal year 2007 and compares this representation to fiscal year 2000 levels and to levels we projected for the end of fiscal year 2007 in our 2003 report ; ( 2 ) for fiscal years 2000 and 2007 , the average age at which women and minorities were appointed to and retired from the ses , the average length of service among those appointed to the ses in fiscal year 1990 , as well as information for 2000 and 2007 on the representation of individuals with targeted disabilities among the ses ; and ( 3 ) on the overall processes used in executive branch agencies for selecting and certifying members into the ses .
the information provided for objectives ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) was reported earlier this year in testimony .
over the past several years , we have reported on the diversity of the senior executive service ( ses ) .
this report goes beyond the representation of the ses in 2007 to include other characteristics of the diversity of the ses , specifically age of ses members and disability status .
the federal government's senior corps generally represents the most experienced segment of the federal career workforce .
for this report , we extracted representation data for the ses and the ses developmental pool governmentwide and by chief financial officers act ( cfo ) agencies for october 2000 and september 2007 from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) central personnel data file ( cpdf ) .
opm and the equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) each play important roles in ensuring equal employment opportunity ( eeo ) in the federal workplace through their leadership and oversight of federal agencies .
for example , we issued a january 2003 report that included both a comprehensive review of career ses by race , ethnicity , and gender governmentwide as of october 2000 and a statistically estimated projection of what the profile of the ses would be in october 2007 if appointment and separation trends did not change .
in june 2008 , opm re - advertised the second opm - sponsored federal candidate development program , and 18 candidates were selected for the program and have started their 12-month training and development program .
having a diverse senior corps can be an organizational strength that can bring a wider variety of perspectives and approaches to bear on policy development and implementation , strategic planning , problem solving , and decision making .
in both 2000 and 2007 , half of the cfo act agencies ( 12 ) did not employ any ses members with targeted disabilities .
