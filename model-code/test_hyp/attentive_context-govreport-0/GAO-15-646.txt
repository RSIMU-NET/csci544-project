this report examines ( 1 ) how selected pfs projects have been structured and what potential benefits these projects can provide ; ( 2 ) how selected pfs contracts have been structured to address potential project risks ; and ( 3 ) the potential roles for the federal government's involvement in pfs projects .
we examined ( 1 ) how selected pfs projects have been structured and what potential benefits these projects can provide ; ( 2 ) how selected pfs contracts have been structured to address potential project risks ; and ( 3 ) the potential roles for the federal government's involvement in pfs projects .
agencies at all levels of government can improve the lives of vulnerable populations and make effective use of available resources by allocating them to prevention programs that demonstrate the promise to innovatively solve intractable social challenges .
federal , state , and local agencies play an important role in improving outcomes for our society's most vulnerable populations , who often face complex social or economic problems .
a small number of foreign and u.s. state and local governments are employing a contracting mechanism known as a social impact bond ( sib ) or a pay for success ( pfs ) program to fund preventive efforts designed to more effectively serve vulnerable populations .
this report responds to a request that we examine pay for success ( pfs ) to help congress gain a better understanding of how the mechanism has been defined in theory and practice and what is known about its implementation and results to date .
these challenges include reducing recidivism rates of recently released prisoners , helping homeless individuals find stable accommodation , and expanding access to quality early childhood education for economically disadvantaged children .
since fiscal year 2014 , the president's budgets have proposed a $300 million appropriation for a new pfs incentive fund in the department of the treasury to expand the role of the federal government and support state and local governments and other intermediaries seeking to establish pfs projects .
members of congress have also introduced legislation during the 113th and 114th congresses on pfs to expand federal support for pfs projects .
the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) and education ( education ) have been exploring opportunities to pursue the pfs concept .
moreover , by defining and achieving prevention outcomes , agencies can potentially reduce future budgetary pressures by lessening the need for costly remediation programs .
the president and members of congress have made proposals to expand federal support for pfs projects .
the departments of labor ( dol ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and justice ( doj ) and the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) have funded or plan to fund specific pfs projects .
to date , four federal agencies have allocated resources to support pfs projects .
in a 2013 memo , omb identified areas in which agencies could improve their use of evidence , including: ( 1 ) strengthening evaluation capacity and proposing new evaluations ; ( 2 ) developing high - quality , low - cost evaluations and rapid , iterative experimentation ; ( 3 ) using innovative outcome - focused design ; and ( 4 ) increasing agency capacity to use evidence .
