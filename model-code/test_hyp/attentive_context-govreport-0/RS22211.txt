estimates of the number of muslims in europe vary widely , depending on the methodology and definitions used , and the geographical limits imposed .
in recent years , there have been influxes of muslim migrants and political refugees from other regions and countries , including the balkans , iraq , somalia , and the west bank and gaza strip .
excluding turkey and the balkans , researchers estimate that as many as 15 to 20 million muslims live on the european continent .
many muslim communities have their roots in western european labor shortages and immigration policies of the 1950s and 1960s that attracted large numbers of north africans , turks , and pakistanis especially .
europe's muslim population is ethnically and linguistically diverse ; muslim immigrants hail from middle eastern , african , and asian countries , as well as turkey .
also notable are european union ( eu ) efforts to boost police and judicial cooperation , enhance intelligence - sharing , and strengthen external eu border controls .
substantial muslim populations exist in western european countries , including france , germany , the united kingdom , spain , italy , the netherlands , and belgium .
the united states and the eu have been placing increasing emphasis on cooperation in the areas of intelligence - sharing , border control , and transport security .
nor has france's assimilation policy prevented the segregation of its muslim communities , as seen most vividly in the riots that erupted throughout france in the fall of 2005 in working class suburbs populated largely by north africans .
long - standing traditions against intelligence - sharing , rivalries among the various local and national security services , and different national laws continue to impede more robust eu cooperation .
historically , european countries have pursued somewhat different policies with respect to managing their immigrant and minority populations .
the united states has captured or identified several u.s. citizens with similar views in the course of the fight against terrorism .
the bush administration and members of congress have welcomed european initiatives to curtail islamist extremism and improve u.s. - eu counterterrorism cooperation in the hopes that such efforts will ultimately help root out terrorist cells in europe and beyond .
however , none has been completely successful .
some terrorism experts and members of congress remain concerned about the u.s. visa waiver program ( vwp ) , despite steps taken to tighten passport requirements for participating countries .
a disproportionately large number of muslims in europe are poor , unemployed , or imprisoned , and many feel a sense of cultural alienation and discrimination .
the vwp has become a sticking point in u.s. - eu relations ; the eu would like the vwp to be extended to all eu members ( currently 12 are excluded due to problems meeting u.s. immigration laws ) .
for example , full implementation of the eu - wide arrest warrant has been slowed in poland and cyprus because of court rulings that found the warrant incompatible with constitutional bans on extraditing their own nationals .
muslims are the largest religious minority in europe , and islam is the continent's fastest growing religion .
in addition , the eu has been working to encourage good integration practices among its 27 member states and prevent radicalization .
