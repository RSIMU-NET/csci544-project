in its place , congress instituted a system of supervised release , which applies to all federal crimes committed after november 1 , 1987 .
supervised release is the successor to parole in the federal criminal justice system .
in 1984 , congress eliminated parole to create a more determinate federal sentencing structure .
2332b ( g ) ( 5 ) ( b ) , the courts must impose a term of supervised release of any term of years or life .
parole ordinarily stands in lieu of a portion of the original term of imprisonment , while supervised release begins only after full service of the original term ( less any "good time" credits ) .
both parole and supervised release call for a period of supervision following release from prison and for reincarceration upon a failure to observe designated conditions .
it authorizes a term of supervised release of not more than five years , when the defendant is convicted of a class a or b felony ( e.g. , bank fraud ) ; not more than three years , when the defendant is convicted of a class c or d felony ( e.g. , bank robbery ) ; and not more than one year , when the defendant is convicted of a class e felony or a misdemeanor ( crimes with a maximum penalty of imprisonment of three years or less ) .
however , the sentencing guidelines , promulgated by the united states sentencing commission , recommend that sentencing courts impose a term of supervised release in most felony cases .
the constitution vests the judicial power of the united states in the supreme court and such inferior courts as congress shall ordain and establish .
there is a split among the circuits , however , over when the term of supervised release begins for a defendant whose release from federal custody is stayed pending a civil commitment determination .
section 3583 ( b ) sets the authorized duration for a term of supervised release , subject to exceptions for certain drug , terrorism , and sex offenses .
the sex offender conditions have generated a number of first amendment challenges , primarily in two areas: overbreadth and freedom of association .
except in specified drug and domestic violence cases , courts may technically exercise discretion to decline to impose supervised release altogether for a particular defendant .
both challenges are often resolved by recourse to section 3583 ( d ) 's "reasonably related" and "no unnecessary deprivation of liberty" requirements , which can provide the narrow tailoring that the first amendment demands .
conversely , a court may extend a defendant's term of supervised release , unless the term has already run or unless the court initially imposed the maximum permissible term .
sentencing courts are said to have broad discretion when imposing the conditions for supervised release , although such discretion must be understood within the confines established for mandatory conditions , the scope of permissible standard discretionary conditions and special conditions , and the deference that must be afforded the sentencing guidelines .
a term of supervised release begins when a prisoner is actually released , regardless of when he should have been released .
sentencing courts determine the terms and conditions of supervised release at the same time that they determine other components of a defendant's sentence , and "[t]he duration , as well as the conditions of supervised release are components of a sentence. .
