this report is intended to provide congress with information about how the military selective service act ( mssa ) , the selective service system ( sss ) , and associated requirements for registration have evolved over time .
the united states has not used conscription to fill manpower requirements for over four decades ; however , the selective service system and the requirement for young men to register for the draft remain today .
congress appropriates approximately $23 million annually to maintain the selective service agency .
men who fail to register are subject to penalties in the form of lost benefits and criminal action .
others have questioned whether the current requirements for registration are fair and equitable .
this report does not discuss the state of the all - volunteer force or whether it is adequate to meet our nation's current or future manpower needs .
still others have suggested amendments to the mssa to address issues of equity , efficiency , and cost .
the first section of the report provides background and history on the military selective service act , the selective service system , and the implementation of the draft in the united states .
the future of the selective service system is a concern for many in congress .
the final section discusses policy options and consideration for congress for the future of the mssa and the selective service system .
some have questioned the need to maintain this agency and the registration requirements .
the second section discusses statutory registration requirements , processes for registering , and penalties for failing to register .
it explains why the united states developed the sss , what the system looks like today , how constituents are affected by the mssa requirements , and what the options and considerations may be for the future of the selective service .
in addition , it will not provide an analysis of other options for military manpower resourcing such as universal military service or universal military training .
the third section discusses the current organization , roles , and resourcing of the selective service system .
these questions and others will be reviewed by the national commission on military , national , and public service established by the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2017 ( p.l .
it also does not discuss the history of the draft and draft planning for health service workers .
following the adoption of the all - volunteer force ( avf ) in 1973 , authority to induct new draftees under the military selective service act ceased .
finally , this report does not evaluate whether the sss , as currently structured , is adequately resourced and organized to perform its statutory mission .
at the same time , some see the preservation of the sss as an important component of national security and emergency preparedness .
conscription into the armed forces of the united states was used just prior to , during , and immediately after world war ii ( wwii ) .
the registration requirements and associated penalties affect young men in every congressional district .
when first adopted in 1863 , national conscription was a marked departure from the traditional military policy of the united states , which from the founding era had relied on a small standing force that could be augmented by state militias in times of conflict .
