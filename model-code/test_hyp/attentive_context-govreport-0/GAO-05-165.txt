as requested , this report discusses the views of nationally recognized experts on key issues concerning wastewater security , including the potential vulnerabilities of wastewater systems ; activities that most warrant federal support to mitigate the risk of terrorism ; and the criteria that the experts believe should be used to determine how any federal funds are allocated among recipients to improve their security and the methods the experts suggest should be used to distribute these funds .
in 2003 , congress responded by considering legislation that would have authorized $200 million for use in making grants to wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement security improvements , $15 million for technical assistance for small systems , and $5 million over 5 years for refinement to vulnerability assessment methodologies .
wastewater systems in the united states provide essential services to residential , commercial , and industrial users by collecting and treating wastewater and discharging it into receiving waters .
should such funds be appropriated , key judgments about which recipients should get funding priority , and how those funds should be spent , will have to be made in the face of great uncertainty about the likely target of an attack ( i.e. , a large but well - protected facility versus a smaller but less - protected facility ) ; the nature of an attack ( cyber , chemical , biological , radiological ) ; and its timing .
while more federal resources have been directed toward drinking water security than wastewater security , some maintain that wastewater systems , like drinking water systems , also possess vulnerabilities that could be exploited .
numerous wastewater utilities have begun to address security concerns by completing vulnerability assessments or by undertaking security upgrades .
in light of the events of september 11 , 2001 , congress and the executive branch have placed increased attention on improving the security of the nation's water infrastructure — including wastewater systems — to protect against future terrorist threats .
to date , the federal government's role in promoting wastewater security has been limited primarily to supporting various training activities on completing vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans and several research projects addressing how contaminants affect treatment systems and other areas .
the experts on our panel have taken these uncertainties into account in deriving their own judgments about these issues .
as agreed with your offices , unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier , we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date .
what specific activities should the federal government support to improve wastewater security ? .
since 2002 , epa has provided more than $10 million to help address the security needs of the wastewater sector .
they note , however , that the implementation of security measures imposes additional financial costs on a sector that is already experiencing difficulty in meeting the financial challenges of an aging infrastructure .
accordingly , the industry has sought federal assistance through the congressional appropriations process .
even though the wastewater industry has not been required by law to undertake the security measures undertaken by drinking water utilities , many in the industry maintain that enhanced security must be pursued .
however , legislation supporting an expanded federal role , including a substantially greater financial commitment , has been proposed in the past and may be considered again in the future .
