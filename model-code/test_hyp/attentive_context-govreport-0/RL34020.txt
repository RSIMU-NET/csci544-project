among the creative works that u.s. copyright law protects are sound recordings , which the copyright act defines as "works that result from the fixation of a series of musical , spoken , or other sounds. .
owners of copyrighted sound recordings have exclusive rights to reproduce , adapt , or distribute their works , or to perform them publicly by digital means .
some members of congress voiced concern as well .
on march 9 , 2007 , the copyright royalty board issued its decision , which was published as a final rule and order on may 1 , 2007 .
enactment of the copyright royalty and distribution reform act of 2004 , p.l .
as required by law , in march 2007 the copyright royalty board announced royalty rates for the period that commenced ( retroactively ) from january 1 , 2006 , through december 31 , 2010 .
however , the copyright law also provides several types of statutory , or compulsory , licenses for sound recordings .
congress interceded as well with enactment of the small webcasters settlement act ( swsa ) of 2002 , p.l .
normally , anyone who wants to exercise any of the copyright owner's exclusive rights must obtain the copyright owner's permission to do so , typically by direct negotiations between copyright owners and users .
in 1998 , in the digital millennium copyright act ( dmca ) , congress amended several statutory licensing statutes to provide for and clarify the treatment of different types of internet broadcasting , or "webcasting. .
in making this determination , the two factors in section 114 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( b ) ( i ) and ( ii ) must be considered , but neither factor defines the standard .
the final determination of the crb establishes new rates for commercial and noncommercial webcasters who qualify for the ยง 114 compulsory license ; the decision is effective on july 15 , 2007 .
rates established pursuant to the original ratemaking determination and swsa were to remain in effect through 2005 .
these licenses allow third parties who pay statutorily prescribed fees to use copyrighted sound recordings under certain conditions and according to specific requirements , without having to negotiate private licensing agreements .
although the past two years have been consumed with the reactions to the copyright royalty board's may 2007 decision , time marches on , and the crb announced on january 5 , 2009 , that it would begin the third proceeding ( "webcaster iii" ) to determine the royalty rates for the statutory license covering internet transmissions of sound recordings , applicable to the next royalty period that runs from january 1 , 2011 , through december 31 , 2015 .
some transmissions of sound recordings are exempt from the public performance right , for example , a nonsubscription broadcast transmission ; a retransmission of a radio station's broadcast within 150 miles of its transmitter ; and a transmission to a business establishment for use in the ordinary course of its business .
rates are as follows: for commercial webcasters: $.0008 per performance for 2006 , $.0011 per performance for 2007 , $.0014 per performance for 2008 , $.0018 per performance for 2009 , and $.0019 per performance for 2010 .
