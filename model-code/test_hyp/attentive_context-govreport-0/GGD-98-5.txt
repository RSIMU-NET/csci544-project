this report includes recommendations to the president's working group on financial markets to ( 1 ) develop a formal mechanism for collecting data on sales practice issues and ( 2 ) consider assisting dealers and end - users in resolving their disagreements over the nature of their relationship as a part of otc derivatives transactions .

because disputes and concerns were also prevalent for transactions involving mortgage - backed securities and structured notes , we included these products in our review as well .

to address congressional concerns associated with sales practices for otc derivatives , mbs , and structured notes , our objectives were to analyze ( 1 ) the federal sales practice requirements applicable to these products and the dealers marketing them ; ( 2 ) the extent of end - user satisfaction with sales practices , product use , and related disputes and the costs of these disputes ; ( 3 ) the views of end - users and dealers on the nature of their relationship and responsibilities ; ( 4 ) the actions dealers and end - users have taken to reduce the potential for sales practice disputes ; and ( 5 ) the actions regulators have taken to address sales practice issues .
to date , attempts to address these differences have not been successful .
these benefits do not come without risk because using otc derivatives , similar to using other financial products , can result in losses from adverse market movements , credit defaults , or operations errors .
these included direct costs from litigation or regulatory fines and indirect costs , such as reduced revenues and income .
review of regulatory and other data indicated that cases involving sales practice disputes were not widespread .
