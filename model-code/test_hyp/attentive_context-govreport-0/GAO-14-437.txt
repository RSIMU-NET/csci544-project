to determine the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) has developed procedures for managing the technical corrosion collaboration ( tcc ) program , we reviewed dod's guidance — the 2014 dod corrosion prevention and mitigation strategic plan .
in 2013 , the department of defense ( dod ) reported spending an estimated $20.8 billion annually to prevent and mitigate corrosion of all of its assets , including military equipment , weapons , facilities , and other infrastructure .
this report addresses to what extent dod ( 1 ) has established procedures for managing the tcc program , ( 2 ) can provide information on the amount of funds spent on the program since inception , and ( 3 ) has established goals for the tcc program and transitioned demonstrated results from projects to the military departments .
congress has taken a series of legislative actions aimed at enhancing dod's ability to effectively address corrosion prevention and mitigation , and to provide congress with greater transparency over the department's corrosion - prevention and mitigation efforts .
dod implements several programs to help prevent and mitigate the costs of corrosion .
to help identify technology or methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion , and educate personnel about corrosion prevention and mitigation , dod funds research by universities and military research labs that participate in dod's technical corrosion collaboration ( tcc ) program , a research and development program .
to determine the extent to which dod has developed procedures for managing the tcc program , we reviewed dod's guidance — the 2014 dod corrosion prevention and mitigation strategic plan .
corrosion is defined in section 2228 of title 10 of the united states code as the deterioration of a material or its properties due to a reaction of that material with its chemical environment .
to better ensure that dod can demonstrate the success of the tcc program and the extent to which tcc results will help to prevent or mitigate corrosion , we recommend that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics require the director , corrosion policy and oversight office , to establish a process for transitioning demonstrated results of tcc projects to the military departments as required by the section 2228 of title 10 of the united states code .
corrosion affects military readiness by taking critical systems out of action and creating safety hazards .
to enhance dod's ability to make consistent and informed decisions in its management of the tcc program in accordance with internal control standards , we recommend that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics require the director , corrosion policy and oversight office , to document the procedures for approving projects within the tcc program for civilian institutions ; document the procedures for selecting and approving projects within the tcc program for military academic institutions ; document the procedures for selecting and approving military research labs supporting civilian and military institutions in conducting projects within the tcc program ; and track and maintain accurate records that include amounts of funds used for the tcc program , and have them readily available for examination to ensure that funding data will be accurately accounted for and reported in future reports , such as the annual budget report to congress .
