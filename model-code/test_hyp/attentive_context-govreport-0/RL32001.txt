although the aids epidemic in the broader latin america and caribbean region is not as pervasive as in africa , over 1.8 million people were estimated to be living with hiv in the region in 2007 , including 230,000 in the caribbean and 1.6 million in latin america .
in terms of sheer numbers , brazil accounts for about one - third of those living with hiv in latin america , but its prevalence rate of 0.5% ( 2005 ) is low compared to many countries in central america and the caribbean .
moreover , the adult prevalence rate in several countries in the caribbean and central america are among the highest outside of sub - saharan africa .
furthermore , brazil's active prevention efforts have lowered prevalence among the high risk groups — intravenous drug users and homosexuals — and the government's extensive antiretroviral ( arv ) treatment program has lowered death rates .
the caribbean countries with the highest prevalence or infection rates in 2006 were haiti , the bahamas , belize , guyana , and trinidad and tobago , with rates between 2% and 4% ; and barbados , the dominican republic , jamaica , and suriname , with rates between 1% and 2% .
in haiti , there are been declining infection levels in port - au - prince and other cites , and the declines appear to be associated with some protective behavioral changes ( an increase in condom use and a drop in the number of sexual partners ) although aids mortality has also been a factor .
the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) notes that haiti's poverty , conflict , and unstable governance have contributed to the rapid spread of aids over the years .
haiti and the dominican republic account for three - quarters of the region's infected population .
in contrast , the mode of transmission in several caribbean and central american countries has been primarily through unprotected heterosexual contact , which has made it more difficult to contain the epidemic because it affects the general population .
in central america , honduras has the highest prevalence rate of 1.5% ( with aids related diseases the second leading cause of death in the country ) , while el salvador , guatemala , and panama have rates just under 1% .
in the dominican republic , where there has been a large increase in the use of condoms by commercial sex workers , the epidemic appears to have stabilized .
however , workers on sugar cane plantations ( bateyes ) continue to have high prevalence rates , with rates up to 12% found among males aged 40-44 .
in honduras , the garifuna community ( descendants of freed black slaves and indigenous caribs from the caribbean island of st. vincent ) concentrated in northern coastal communities has been especially hard hit by the epidemic , with over 8% and 14% of the population infected .
the epidemic in central america is concentrated in large urban areas , although some rural areas have been hard hit .
nevertheless , trends in both countries suggest the need to protect against a resurgence of the epidemic .
high prevalence rates have also been found among female sex workers in el salvador , honduras , and guatemala .
