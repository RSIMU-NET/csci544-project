the act's changes were due to take effect for tax years beginning after december 31 , 2008 .
among these provisions were more generous rules for multinationals to use in allocating interest expense for purposes of the u.s. foreign tax credit .

the jobs act's interest allocation provision was designed to correct what some argue was an imperfection in the design of the foreign tax credit rules .
111-147 , further delayed implementation to 2021 .
tax planning techniques could undermine this objective — and lead to increased revenue loss and efficiency costs .
specifically , the provision expands the subgroup election for banks to include other financial intermediaries , including insurance companies — which allows for the separate calculation of interest allocation .
another proposal in the 111 th congress , h.r .
because of effects detailed below , the more interest that is assigned to domestic sources , the more foreign tax credits a firm can claim and the lower its u.s. tax liability .
some believed that the prior law's approach unduly left taxpayers exposed to double taxation of foreign - source income .
this provision could insulate some firms from a portion of the interest allocation rules , and it is at odds with the theory underlying the act's other provisions .
the act contained another relevant modification to the interest allocation rules , that would increase a firm's creditable taxes .
the analysis here indicates that worldwide allocation rules , while losing revenue , would likely be better aligned with the objective of the foreign tax credit .
in general , the tax code places a limit on the foreign tax credit .
to calculate the limit , firms are required to separate interest and other expenses according to source — foreign or domestic .
the jobs act addressed this perceived flaw .
