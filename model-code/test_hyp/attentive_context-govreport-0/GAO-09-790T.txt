postal service ( usps ) operations .
my statement will ( 1 ) update usps's financial condition and outlook and explain our recent decision to place usps's financial condition on our high - risk list , and ( 2 ) discuss the need for usps to restructure its mail processing , retail , and delivery networks and its efforts to improve their efficiency .
my statement is based upon on our past and ongoing work , including the report being released today on usps efforts to improve delivery efficiency , and our report adding usps to the high - risk list , as well as our continued monitoring of usps's financial condition and outlook .
we reported that usps urgently needs to restructure to address its current and long - term financial viability .
we stated that usps's restructuring plan should address how it plans to realign postal services , such as delivery frequency , delivery standards , and access to retail services , with changes in the use of mail by consumers and businesses ; better align costs and revenues , including compensation and benefit costs ; optimize its operations , networks , and workforce ; increase mail volumes and revenues ; and retain earnings , so that it can finance needed capital investments and repay its growing debt .
usps has limited its capital expenditures to help conserve cash , which may affect its maintenance backlog .
as a result , usps is projecting the following for fiscal year 2009: a net loss of about $7 billion , even if it achieves record cost savings of about $6 billion ; an increase in outstanding debt by the annual statutory limit of $3 billion ; and , despite this borrowing , an unprecedented $1 billion cash shortfall .
the long - term challenge is to restructure usps operations , networks , and workforce to reflect changes in mail volume , use of the mail , and revenue .
under this scenario , usps would increase its outstanding debt by an additional $3 billion , which would bring its total debt to $13.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2010 — only $1.8 billion less than its $15 billion statutory limit .
accordingly , we have called for usps to develop and implement a broad restructuring plan — with input from the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) and other stakeholders , and approval by congress and the administration — that includes key milestones and time frames for actions , addresses key issues , and identifies what steps congress and other stakeholders may need to take .
usps's projected cost cutting of about $6 billion for this fiscal year is much larger than its previous annual cost - cutting targets that have ranged from nearly $900 million to $2 billion since 2001 .
further , it has high overhead ( institutional ) costs that are hard to change in the short term , such as providing universal service that includes 6-day delivery and maintaining a network of 37,000 post offices and retail facilities , as well as a delivery network of more than 149 million addresses .
to achieve financial viability , usps must align its costs with revenues , generate sufficient earnings to finance capital investment , and manage its debt .
