our objectives were to answer the following questions: ( 1 ) how well does the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) ensure that lenders participating in the multifamily accelerated processing ( map ) program meet hud's qualification requirements ? .
 ( 2 ) how well is hud implementing its processes for reviewing and monitoring map lenders' underwriting of loans ? .
strengthen the lender qualifications and monitoring division's monitoring of lenders and hud field offices , by ( 1 ) establishing a time frame for finalizing and issuing written operating procedures that include criteria for selecting loans and lenders for review that pose a high insurance risk to the department ; ( 2 ) issuing written reports on all quality assurance reviews conducted in fiscal year 2001 to the cognizant map lenders and hud field offices ; and ( 3 ) developing a process for aggregating and analyzing the results of quality assurance reviews to identify patterns of underwriting deficiencies and program violations by map lenders .
each year , the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) insures billions of dollars in multifamily housing mortgage loans to facilitate the construction , substantial rehabilitation , purchase , and refinancing of apartments and health care facilities .
 ( 2 ) how well is hud implementing processes for reviewing and monitoring map lenders' underwriting of loans ? .
fha mortgage insurance protects lenders against financial losses stemming from a borrower's default .
hud could improve its implementation of processes for reviewing and monitoring map lenders' underwriting of loans .
to improve hud's oversight of map lenders and to reduce the financial risks assumed by fha , we recommend that the secretary of hud direct the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner to do the following: strengthen the process for approving map lenders by ( 1 ) issuing guidance that clarifies hud's experience requirements for map underwriters and requires hud staff to evaluate prospective map underwriters against these standards ; and ( 2 ) issuing guidelines that establish standards for quality control plans and require map lenders to develop and maintain these plans as a condition of continued participation in the map program .
 ( 3 ) has hud held any map lenders accountable for noncompliance with program requirements ? .
however , hud has not fully implemented its quality assurance process .
specifically , although the lender qualifications and monitoring division is tasked with implementing this process , it has not ( 1 ) achieved its intended staffing level , ( 2 ) developed and implemented formal operating procedures , or ( 3 ) effectively used the results of its reviews to improve lenders' underwriting of loans .
 ( 3 ) has hud held any map lenders accountable for noncompliance with program requirements ? .
improve field offices' implementation of procedures for reviewing mortgage insurance applications submitted by map lenders , by ( 1 ) holding map team leaders accountable for preparing required review memos , and for ensuring that hud field office staff consistently use review checklists in accordance with map guidance ; ( 2 ) utilizing data in hud's financial assessment subsystem to corroborate expense data for hud - insured or - assisted properties used as comparable properties in appraisal reports ; and ( 3 ) clarifying and enforcing hud's requirement for updating the operating expense estimate for a subject property to the date of the appraisal .
