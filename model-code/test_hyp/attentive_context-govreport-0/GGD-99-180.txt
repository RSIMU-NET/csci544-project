in reviewing bhc merger applications , the federal reserve board ( frb ) has a statutory responsibility , established by the bank holding company act of 1956 ( bhc act ) and the community reinvestment act of 1977 ( cra ) , to take into account an institution's record of community credit performance when evaluating the application .
as you requested , this report discusses large bank holding company ( bhc ) mergers and the impact of such mergers on lending in low - and moderate - income ( lmi ) areas .
as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to analyze ( 1 ) frb's legal responsibilities in assessing bhc mergers for cra performance ; ( 2 ) frb's process for assessing the cra performance of six large bhc merger applicants , including how frb addressed the principal public concerns related to the cra performance ; and ( 3 ) the premerger and postmerger mortgage lending in lmi and minority communities for three large bhc mergers .
in addition , the bhc act requires that frb take into account the convenience and needs of the community to be served when reviewing bhc merger applications .
to meet the first two objectives , we focused on six of the largest bank mergers in the period of 1995-98 .
our legal analysis included a review of the bank holding company act of 1956 ( bhc act ) and the community reinvestment act of 1977 ( cra ) .
in addition , a more transparent process may contribute to more focused public comments from community organizations and provide commenters with knowledge of how frb analyzes an institution's cra record , such as its home mortgage lending performance .
to enhance the transparency and improve the efficiency with which cra concerns are addressed in the bhc merger application process , we recommend that frb develop written guidelines that summarize how public comments raising cra concerns are used with cra examination information in frb's merger application decisions for large bhcs .
frb faced limitations in its legal authority to address branch closure concerns .
enhanced transparency could improve the bhc applicants' understanding of what information is expected of them , what role public comments play in frb's cra review , and what information frb focuses on in response to different cra concerns .
a more transparent process is needed regarding how frb balances the cra ratings of banks , particularly those with good cra ratings , such as the banks in our study , with public comments raising cra concerns .
a more transparent process could be useful for both bhc applicants and public commenters .
to assess frb's process for reviewing bhc merger applications for cra performance , we used a case study approach .
we also did not verify the accuracy of data and other inputs relied upon by frb in its review of the six merger applications .
such guidelines could also include when and how concerns raised in public comments will be considered , the types of analyses frb is likely to conduct and rely upon in reaching its conclusions , and the situations in which hmda statistics are limited .
we did not assess the quality of previous cra examinations conducted by primary banking regulators or the accuracy of public comments .
