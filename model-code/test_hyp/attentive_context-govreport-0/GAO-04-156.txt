the department of defense ( dod ) , in particular , accounts for a large percentage of the federal government's purchase card use .
for fiscal year 2002 , dod reported that an average of about 207,000 cardholders used purchase cards to make about 11 million transactions at a cost of nearly $7 billion .
to meet the objectives of this assignment , we requested that dod and the military services provide us with the ( 1 ) status of dod and the military services' efforts in implementing the provisions of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 and the dod appropriations act , 2003 , ( 2 ) status of actions taken to implement the recommendations included in the four gao reports , and ( 3 ) administrative or disciplinary actions taken against individuals we identified as having made potentially fraudulent , improper , and abusive or questionable transactions .
in prior years , the dod purchase card program at dod has not been well managed .
in response to these concerns , the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 ( national defense authorization act ) , section 1007 , required dod to improve the management of the purchase card program .
in addition , dod and the military services have taken actions on nearly all of 109 recommendations that gao made in its four reports on the purchase card program , and dod has plans to have most of the recommendations implemented by june 2004 .
we identified ( 1 ) a proliferation of cardholders , ( 2 ) lack of documented evidence of training of cardholders and approving officials , ( 3 ) inadequate program monitoring , and ( 4 ) lack of disciplinary actions against cardholders who abused the purchase cards .
in the past few years , the use of purchase cards has dramatically increased as federal agencies have sought to eliminate the lengthy process and paperwork long associated with making small purchases .
to address the issues identified , we made over 100 recommendations targeted at improving the design and implementation of controls over card use and establishing guidelines for disciplining those who misused their government purchase cards .
the report also provides the status of dod efforts to implement the recommendations we made in the reports issued during fiscal years 2002 and 2003 aimed at improving the military service's management of the purchase card program .
dod has initiated actions to implement all of the requirements that were mandated in the fiscal year 2003 national defense authorization and dod appropriations acts .
while dod and the military services provided evidence documenting actions taken to improve the purchase card program and to prevent individuals and companies from further obtaining fraudulent , improper , and abusive or questionable items with a dod purchase card , we did not make any field visits to independently validate whether dod had effectively implemented the reported changes .
dod and the military services have taken strong actions to improve the controls over the purchase card program .
as we stated in various testimonies and reports issued between july 2001 and december 2002 , significant breakdowns in internal controls over the army , navy , and air force management of the purchase card program left the services vulnerable to fraud , waste , and abuse .
