 ( recommendation 3 ) .
for fiscal year 2017 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) requested over $34 billion for o&s .
operations and support ( o&s ) costs make up the majority — sometimes over 70 percent — of an acquisition program's total lifetime costs .
this report assesses , for selected major acquisition programs , the extent that ( 1 ) dhs's budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight ; and ( 2 ) o&s life - cycle cost estimates ( lcces ) are comprehensive and accurate , as well as regularly updated .
however , if information on such costs is vague or inconsistent , congress's ability to conduct oversight would be limited , which in turn can affect its funding decisions for major acquisition programs .
the house homeland security subcommittee on oversight and management efficiency asked us to evaluate operations and maintenance ( o&s ) activities for the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) major acquisition programs .
we found in april 2015 that dhs's funding plans for major acquisition programs did not reflect all of the estimated costs for certain programs , particularly for o&s , resulting in potential operational shortfalls .
this report assesses , for selected major acquisition programs , the extent that ( 1 ) dhs budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight ; and ( 2 ) life - cycle cost estimates ( lcces ) are comprehensive and accurate , as well as regularly updated .
if programs experience o&s funding shortfalls , they may fall short of operational goals or not be able to address maintenance needs .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the dhs chief financial officer should reverse the exclusion of o&s funding at a major acquisition program level in its future years homeland security program report for all components .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the secretary of homeland security should work with congress to include o&s data in monthly execution reports at a major acquisition program level within current program / project activity accounts .
until dhs takes concrete action to reverse the exclusion of o&s funding at a major acquisition program level in its future years homeland security program reports , congress will lack important information necessary for oversight .
we made a recommendation to dhs , with which the department concurred , to account for all o&s funding dhs plans to allocate to each of the coast guard's major acquisition programs .
we are making the following three recommendations to dhs: the secretary of homeland security should work with congress to add information to its annual congressional budget justification to show o&s funding requests for major acquisition programs within current program / project activity accounts .
also , as a system becomes operational , users rely on o&s funds for support through the duration of the system's lifetime .
dhs and the coast guard are continuing to address this recommendation .
dhs first used its common appropriations structure — which dhs proposed and congress enacted — to address appropriations and budget management inconsistencies in its fiscal year 2016 budget submission .
