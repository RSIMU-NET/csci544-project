to identify changes in the department of defense's ( dod ) on - hand and on - order inventories for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 , we used data developed in prior reviews and inventory stratification reports .
the department of defense maintains a supply of spare and repair parts in order to keep its equipment operational for war - and peace - time missions .
the management of this inventory is especially critical as the department and the services are called upon for new missions relating to combating terrorism worldwide and protecting the homeland .
in response to your request , this report ( 1 ) provides information on changes in and make up of the department's inventory and ( 2 ) analyzes changes in inventory requirements , with a focus on causes of requirements changes derived from a sample of navy inventory items .
nevertheless , the department has attributed readiness problems to parts shortages .
such changes in missions can lead to changes in inventory requirements , which , in turn , determine the size of the inventory .
while some improvements have been made , in january 2003 we reported that these conditions still existed and that over half of the department's inventory is not needed to satisfy current operating requirements .
since 1990 , we have identified the department's management of secondary inventory as a high - risk area because levels of inventory were too high and management systems and procedures were ineffective .
while the services are implementing management changes that will reduce the size of dod's inventory , long - standing and systemic inventory management problems continue to exist .
to improve the accuracy of the navy's secondary inventory requirements , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy to require the commander , naval supply systems command , require its inventory managers to use the most current data available for computing administrative lead time requirements .
this report , in response to your interest in the department of defense's inventory management , is one in a series on the department's management of secondary inventory â€” that is , spare and repair parts , clothing , medical , and other items that support the military's operating forces .
the services are implementing management changes that will reduce the size of dod's reported inventory and the amount of inventory that satisfies requirements .
a navy inventory reporting change and increased dod inventory requirements contributed significantly to the growth in dod's inventory .
about 37,000 items accounted for $4.3 billion in inventory requirements increases , and another 37,000 items accounted for a $1.2 billion decrease in inventory requirements decreases .
since 1995 we have reported on imbalances in dod's inventory , and our current work shows that these imbalances continue to exist .
dod's overall inventory requirements increased by $10.6 billion , or 26 percent , between the end of fiscal years 1999 and 2001 , with some of the navy's requirements being overstated .
overall , the amount of dod's inventory that exceeds current operating requirements has decreased since 1996 .
the navy has not formally updated the data it uses to project administrative lead time requirements for aviation parts since 1999 , and thus these requirements are overstated .
