those issues include the following: the prospects for u.s. energy exports , including exports of natural gas and coal ; prospects for u.s. energy companies' investments in china ; chinese investment in the u.s. energy sector ; manufacturing competitiveness between the united states and china ; china's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change ; china's ability to reduce the severe air pollution that hangs over parts of the country , and thus reduce the airborne pollutants that have been shown to travel from china to the west coast of the united states ; china's political and economic relationships with such regions as central asia , a major supplier of natural gas to china via pipelines , and the middle east , currently a major supplier of oil and lng to china ; china's plans for disputed waters in the south china sea , which may contain significant hydrocarbon resources ; and china's management of its energy - rich but troubled xinjiang region , which has a large ethnic turkic population and has been the subject of human rights concerns from governments and groups outside china , and of chinese government concerns about separatism , terrorism , and religious extremism .
china is the sixth largest natural gas producer in the world , with its production almost tripling over the course of 2005-2014 ( see figure 1 ) .
when it comes to global supply and demand for natural gas , china is the main wildcard .
china's production is currently less than 20% of u.s. natural gas production .
its natural gas resource base is large , and its shale gas endowment is estimated to be nearly double that of the united states .
in addition , congress has oversight and appropriations roles related to u.s. dialogues and other cooperation with china on natural gas issues .
agencies involved in those efforts include the u.s. department of energy , the u.s. department of state , and the u.s. trade and development agency .
to address air pollution and to meet recent global commitments it has made to reduce its greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions , china has prioritized expanding consumption of cleaner energy sources , including natural gas .
china's natural gas plans have implications for a number of issues in which congress has expressed a strong interest .
yet , natural gas made up only 6% of china's primary energy consumption in 2014 ( see figure 2 ) , while natural gas accounted for 30% of the u.s. fuel mix .
this is partly due to its geology , regulatory regime , and a lack of technical skills , all of which make it difficult to bring natural gas to market , among other issues ( see " domestic industry concerns " ) .
china has struggled to manage serious environmental problems caused , in part , by its longtime reliance on coal for electric power .
in the 114 th congress , members have expressed interest in chinese policy related to natural gas in hearings , such as the senate committee on energy and natural resources' january 2015 hearing on s. 33 , the lng permitting certainty and transparency act , and the same committee's february 2015 hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the u.s. department of energy .
