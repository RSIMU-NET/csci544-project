the department of defense's ( dod ) military health system ( mhs ) exists to ensure that servicemembers , including medical providers , are ready to deploy and accomplish missions .
 ( recommendation 6 ) .
in february 2020 , the department of defense ( dod ) submitted its implementation plan ( “the plan” ) to congress in response to section 703 ( d ) of the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2017 .
§ 1073d and considered complete information , and ( 2 ) dod has positioned itself to execute transition planning for restructuring its mtfs .
dod's budget request for the defense health program has decreased from $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2019 to $33.1 billion in fiscal year 2021 .
these practices include establishment of ( 1 ) a process for monitoring progress , ( 2 ) roles and responsibilities , ( 3 ) committed leadership from all levels of an organization , and ( 4 ) a dedicated team vested with necessary authority and resources to help set priorities , make timely decisions , and move quickly to implement decisions .
dod also has not defined objectives in a measurable way with related thresholds and goals to enable monitoring of progress and challenges .
this report addresses the extent to which ( 1 ) dod's methodology for determining mtf restructuring actions in the plan prioritized cross - cutting elements from 10 u.s.c .
for example , as previously discussed , dod's three general priorities , or objectives , for restructuring mtfs include ensuring ( 1 ) the medical readiness of servicemembers and readiness of medical providers , ( 2 ) that civilian health care facilities and providers adequately support the health care needs of beneficiaries near each mtf , and ( 3 ) the cost - effectiveness of mtf and purchased care .
until dod takes action to address these gaps by using more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality , access , and cost - effectiveness , dod leaders may not fully understand risks to the achievement of their objectives in restructuring future mtfs .
as the cost of the mhs increased over the past 2 decades as a share of dod's base budget , dod leaders have sought to improve readiness while curtailing the growth of the defense health program that funds the mtfs and purchased care .
dod guidance states that beneficiaries should have a choice of health care providers that is sufficient to ensure access to appropriate , high - quality health care .
to that end , dod's hospitals , medical centers , and clinics — referred to collectively as military medical treatment facilities ( mtf ) — are critical to the mhs .
in response to other provisions in the ndaa for fiscal year 2017 , dod has made reforms aimed at improving the mhs focus on readiness .
these elements include the ( 1 ) support an mtf provides to servicemembers' medical readiness and the readiness of medical personnel , ( 2 ) adequacy of civilian health care in proximity to each mtf , and ( 3 ) cost - effectiveness of direct care services at mtfs versus purchased care in nearby civilian provider networks .
