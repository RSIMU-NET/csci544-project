currently , the united states has active economic sanctions imposed on three major oil - producing and exporting countries: iran , russia , and venezuela .
generally , sanctions - related supply losses have been counterbalanced by increased production and exports from the united states , russia , and other countries ; petroleum trade flow adjustments ; indications of slowing global oil demand growth rates ; and design elements of oil - related sanctions .
oil - related sanctions are one option that could be used to apply economic pressure on certain countries in order to achieve broader geopolitical and foreign policy objectives .
a sustained global petroleum supply imbalance of 1% to 2% could contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements ( both upward and downward ) for crude oil and related petroleum products ( e.g. , gasoline and diesel fuel ) .
finally , the administration has continued to strengthen oil - related sanctions on venezuela through the use of e.o.s and administrative actions .
these design elements are intended to mitigate sanctions - related market and price impacts and to build into the sanctions regime multilateral coordination and cooperation .
venezuela oil production has likely also been affected , although accurately quantifying volumes is challenging due to monthly oil production declines that had been occurring over a period of years prior to u.s. sanctions affecting oil trade in january 2019 .
economic sanctions are one foreign policy tool that can be used to potentially influence the behavior and actions of political leadership in other countries .
the scope of this report is to assess the possible impact of current u.s. economic sanctions on oil production in and exports from iran , russia , and venezuela .
oil sanctions frameworks can include wind - down periods , requirements to consider and certify that global oil supply is adequate to compensate for supply reductions , and engagement with other oil producers before applying certain sanctions .
sanctions - related oil supply losses and trade constraints have had an impact on oil markets .
combined , these countries produced approximately 17.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of oil in 2018âapproximately 18% of total world oil productionâaccording to one estimate .
to date , oil supply impacts related to economic sanctions have not generally resulted in significant upward price pressure for benchmark oil prices .
sanctions applied to russia's oil sector generally target long - term , high - risk oil production projects .
only a portion of these supply volumes might be directly affected by u.s. economic sanctions in the near termâpotentially ranging from 3.3 million to 4.0 million bpd from both iran ( estimated to be 2.8 million bpd ) and venezuela ( estimated to range from 0.5 million to as much as 1.2 million bpd ) .
regarding russia , some members of congress have called for additional sanctions , and several bills have been introduced in the 116 th congress with certain provisions that could affect russia's oil sector .
venezuela sanctions imposed to date prohibit petroleum trade with the united statesâhistorically one of the primary destinations for venezuela's oil exportsâand have the potential to affect venezuela's petroleum trade with other countries .
in some cases , u.s. economic sanctions that target oil sectors in iran , russia , and venezuela have observably affected oil markets in several ways , including reductions in supply , changes in price relationships , and adjustments to trade flows .
