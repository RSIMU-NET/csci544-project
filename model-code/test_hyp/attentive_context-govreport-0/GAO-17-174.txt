the secretary of energy should direct the office of nuclear energy to reassess its decision to engage in discussions with potential host communities , screen sites , or conduct other site selection activities until key prerequisites to these efforts — such as revising health and safety regulations — have been addressed .
these defense - related activities produced about 14,000 metric tons of nuclear waste , consisting of high - level waste ( hlw ) and spent nuclear fuel ( snf ) that are currently stored in facilities in five states and managed by the department of energy ( doe ) .
from 1944 until the 1980s , the united states used nuclear reactors to produce plutonium and other materials for nuclear weapons .
to ensure balance among the entities , we interviewed representatives from ( 1 ) independent groups and academia , ( 2 ) community interest groups , ( 3 ) industry , ( 4 ) state and local governments , and ( 5 ) the federal government .
we found that doe's cost estimates were not reliable because they excluded major costs that will likely add tens of billions of dollars , were minimally documented , lacked transparency , and were not fully credible .
in addition , the nation has nearly 80,000 metric tons of commercial snf from the nation's fleet of nuclear power reactors — an amount that is expected to increase by more than 2,000 metric tons per year .
specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) what doe cited as the benefits of a separate defense hlw repository in its recommendation to the president ; ( 2 ) the reliability of doe's cost and schedule estimates for its new plan to site , license , and construct a defense hlw repository ; and ( 3 ) doe's efforts to site a defense hlw repository and key challenges , if any , to siting the repository .
we compared this information with the best practices identified in the cost guide to determine whether the cost estimates were ( 1 ) comprehensive , ( 2 ) accurate , ( 3 ) well documented , and ( 4 ) credible .
we evaluated this information to determine whether the doe - developed schedules were ( 1 ) comprehensive , ( 2 ) well - constructed , ( 3 ) credible , and ( 4 ) controlled .
stakeholders from potentially affected states and communities have raised concerns about the potential increased costs to defense appropriations that could result from doe's plan .
these categories covered ( 1 ) independent groups and academia , ( 2 ) community interest groups , ( 3 ) industry , ( 4 ) state and local governments , and ( 5 ) the federal government .
doe estimates that the amount of commercial snf will increase to about 140,000 metric tons over the next several decades .
the secretary of energy should direct the office of nuclear energy to conduct a comprehensive assessment , which adheres to omb guidance and best practices , of the benefits , costs , and schedules of the options it reviewed and provided to the president in 2015 , and , in light of the new information and results of its assessment , revise — if needed — the report's conclusion that a strong basis exists to find that a defense hlw repository is required .
