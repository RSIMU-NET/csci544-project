this report ( 1 ) discusses the progress made and some of the problems still facing the department in real property management and ( 2 ) contains recommendations to you to strengthen the department's management .
we based that decision on a number of factors , including the actions taken by the state department and its office of foreign buildings operations ( fbo ) to strengthen real property programs .
the report is based on our work at fbo headquarters and the embassies in nassau , the bahamas ; london , england ; vienna , austria ; santo domingo , dominican republic ; port moresby , papua new guinea ; kuala lumpur , malaysia ; and singapore , singapore .
however , because some problems still exist , state's management of overseas real property still needs to be closely monitored .
in february 1995 , we removed overseas real property management from our list of federal programs most vulnerable to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
management weaknesses also directly contributed to construction delays and cost overruns , oversized and unauthorized housing , poor decisions , and questionable expenditures .
fbo has made progress in strengthening its monitoring capability through its financial audit program , but coverage has been limited .
to upgrade its system capability , fbo is examining the potential for integrating data maintained in the department's new information financial management system and the fbo real estate management system .
these weaknesses resulted in deteriorating facilities and a significant backlog of maintenance and repair requirements .
we reviewed pertinent records and documents , including the fam and fbo's guidance on use of funds ; global maintenance surveys and facilities evaluation and assistance program reports ; fbo's financial audit , real estate management system , and area management trip reports ; and posts' status of obligation reports , purchase orders , and work order reports .
progress has been made in strengthening fbo's planning capabilities .
progress has been made in addressing the long - standing problem of inadequate maintenance and rehabilitation of overseas facilities .
in some cases , area managers ( 1 ) either did not prepare or could not locate their trip reports documenting the status of post controls or ( 2 ) had not completed fbo's standard checklists .
fbo has responsibility for managing about 11,000 leased properties and 3,000 u.s. - owned properties valued about $12 billion .
some progress has also been made in the area management program .
fbo's responsibilities include ( 1 ) overseeing the acquisition , design , construction , sales , operations , and maintenance of properties and ( 2 ) establishing policies and procedures for overseas posts to follow in managing real property programs .
overall , fbo estimates that its financial audit program has resulted in nearly $4 million in uncommitted post funds being returned to fbo for use in other projects and programs .
fbo also recognizes that overall weaknesses in accountability over real property transactions continue .
that obligation ( 1 ) represented a potential misuse of routine maintenance funds and ( 2 ) appeared to represent an effort to fully obligate remaining funds ( year - end buying ) instead of returning them to fbo .
