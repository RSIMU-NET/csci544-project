specifically , we identified ( 1 ) to what extent fta's triennial reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 , ( 2 ) the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process , and ( 3 ) fta's performance measures for the triennial review and to what extent fta's measures meet key attributes of successful performance measures .
the department of transportation's federal transit administration ( fta ) fosters the development and maintenance of bus , subway , trolley , passenger ferry boat , and other public transportation systems through several grant programs to transit agencies serving both rural ( population less than 50,000 ) and urban communities ( population 50,000 or more ) .
to determine the extent to which the triennial reviews indicate grantees met federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 , we reviewed documentation on the federal transit administration's ( fta ) oversight tracking system ( otrak ) — the official electronic information system for tracking and monitoring oversight activities .
public transportation systems are playing an increasingly important role in the nation's overall transportation system .
public transit increases mobility for millions of americans in communities both large and small , provides congestion relief , promotes safe travel , and helps reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil .
in addition , congress recently appropriated an additional $6 billion for the urbanized area formula program in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 .
fta officials recognize the limits of their current performance measures and have begun efforts to enhance them .
fta's current performance measures partially address governmentwide priorities by ensuring that fta reports on its timeliness in conducting reviews and in addressing corrective actions .
this urbanized area formula program received 42 percent of fta grant funds — about $22 billion from fiscal years 2004 through 2009 .
therefore , fta does not assess whether the triennial review program is increasing grantees' ability to continuously meet federal requirements .
from fiscal years 2004 through 2008 , fta nearly met its goals in 4 of the 5 years .
both measures meet 4 of 9 attributes ; that is , they link to agency goals , provide a measurable target , are clear , and have limited overlap with other measures .
strong fta oversight of federal surface transportation grant programs helps ensure that grantees meet federal requirements , provide safe public transportation , and safeguard from misuse the billions of dollars that congress appropriated for surface transportation programs to help america recover from the economic downturn and the billions more that congress plans to reauthorize for surface transportation .
we selected these grantees on several factors , including their past performance , as assessed by triennial reviews ; having both a triennial review and another fta oversight review in the same fiscal year ; and demographic features , such as size and geographic region .
to identify the extent to which triennial reviews indicate that grantees are meeting applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 , we obtained and analyzed data from fta's oversight tracking system ( otrak ) — the official electronic information system used for tracking and monitoring oversight activities .
