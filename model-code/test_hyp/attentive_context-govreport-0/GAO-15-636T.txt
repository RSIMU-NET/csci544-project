i am pleased to be here today to provide some preliminary observations from our ongoing review of the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) science advisory board ( sab ) and the clean air scientific advisory committee ( casac ) .
we are carrying out this work for the senate committee on environment and public works and the house committee on science , space , and technology .
as federal advisory committees , the sab and casac must comply with the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) and its implementing regulations .
the environmental research , development , and demonstration authorization act of 1978 ( erddaa ) mandated that epa establish the sab and required the sab to provide the epa administrator with scientific advice as requested .
this testimony reflects our preliminary observations from our ongoing review that examines ( 1 ) the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional committees' requests for scientific advice from the sab ensure compliance with erddaa and ( 2 ) the extent to which casac has provided advice related to naaqs .
water body connectivity is the biological , chemical , and hydrologic connectivity of waters and the effects that small streams , wetlands , and open waters have on larger downstream waters such as rivers , lakes , estuaries , and oceans .
epa's written procedures for processing congressional committee requests to the sab are found in the sab charter and in the following two documents that establish general policies for how epa's federal advisory committees are to interact with outside parties: epa policy regarding communication between members of federal advisory committee act committees and parties outside of the epa ( the april 2014 policy ) , and clarifying epa policy regarding communications between members of scientific and technical federal advisory committees and outside parties ( the november 2014 policy clarification ) .
in addition , recent testimony received by the committee has raised questions regarding whether casac advises epa of any adverse public health , welfare , social , economic , or energy effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of naaqs as called for in the clean air act .
as you know , the sab and casac are federal advisory committees that review the scientific and technical basis for epa's decision making .
recent interactions between the house committee on science , space , and technology and the sab related to specific sab reviews on hydraulic fracturing and water body connectivity have raised questions with the committee regarding whether the sab is fulfilling its statutory obligations to provide scientific advice to the designated congressional committees .
in addition , epa must have procedures to ensure that the advice or recommendations of its federal advisory committees , including the sab , are products of their independent judgment and not “inappropriately” influenced by epa .
naaqs , we reviewed the clean air act , its legislative history , and legal cases involving the act .
these two federal advisory committees were established pursuant to statute .
the clean air act requires epa to set and periodically review and revise naaqs for certain air pollutants , the emission of which cause or contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare .
