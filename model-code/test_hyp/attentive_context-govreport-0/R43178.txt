the rapid pace of technological advances , including the shift from voice to data , from wireline to wireless , and from copper to fiber is redefining the parameters of the telecommunications and media markets .
in general terms , the regulatory debate focuses on a number of issues including the extent to which existing regulations should be applied to traditional providers as they enter new markets where they do not hold market power , the extent to which existing regulations should be imposed on new entrants as they compete with traditional providers in the same markets , and the appropriate regulatory framework to be imposed on new and / or converging technologies that are not easily classified under the present framework .
the deployment , adoption , and regulatory treatment of broadband technologies continues to hold a major focus in the policy debate .
the transition of the universal service fund to the connect america fund to support broadband deployment and adoption has generated concerns regarding consequences for small rate - of - return carriers .
as these changes dramatically transform the marketplace , there is a growing consensus that existing laws and regulations be reexamined to address this transformation .
the impact of broadband deployment on the media sector as consumers change their viewing patterns and adopt new delivery technologies is also central to the debate .
if , and to what extent , the role of the federal communications commission and state regulatory bodies should be modified as networks transition from a circuit - switched to an internet protocol network and how to ensure that the core values ( e.g. , consumer protection , public safety , disability access , and competition ) are preserved in this new environment are also being addressed .
how traditional policy goals , such as the advancement of universal service mandates in the provision of telecommunications services and the media market's long - standing policy objectives of localism , diversity of voices , and competition , should be applied , and / or revised , as these markets transform is also under consideration .
some policymakers feel it is necessary to take steps to ensure access to the internet for content , services , and applications providers , as well as consumers , while others feel that such actions will slow deployment of and access to the internet , and limit innovation .
the ability of new wireless technologies to deliver a variety of communications services and the increasing demand for mobility has placed increased pressure on usable spectrum as consumer demand fuels commercial demand for spectrum .
the allocation and regulation of radio - frequency spectrum has also become a crucial component in the policy debate .
the public sector also requires spectrum for a variety of government and emergency uses .
policymakers are increasingly being called upon to balance the needs of both the public and the private sector .
internet regulation and the fcc's authority to implement such regulations , which is currently facing court challenge , is an issue of growing importance in the wide ranging debate over broadband regulation .
according to the federal communications commission's ( fcc's ) national broadband plan , the lack of adequate broadband availability is most pressing in rural america , where the costs of serving large geographical areas , coupled with low population densities , often reduce economic incentives for telecommunications providers to invest in and maintain broadband infrastructure and service .
