to deal with this situation , a variety of government - to - government efforts and transatlantic dialogues have been created to increase understanding between policymakers and regulators on both sides of the atlantic , to minimize existing regulatory barriers , and to prevent the emergence of new regulatory barriers .
the united states and the 27-member european union ( eu ) share a huge , dynamic , and mutually beneficial economic partnership .
while the transatlantic market is today highly integrated due in large part to a massive amount of foreign direct investment by both u.s. and european companies in each other's markets , differences in regulatory approaches , standards , and philosophies militate against the development of an even tighter and more integrated marketplace .
not only is the u.s. - eu commercial relationship , what many call the transatlantic economy , the largest in the world , it is also arguably the most important .
they also agreed on a framework for advancing transatlantic economic integration ( the framework ) and created a new institutional structure , the transatlantic economic council ( tec ) , to advance the process of regulatory cooperation and barrier reduction .
at the 2007 u.s. - eu summit , leaders of the eu and united states committed their governments to increasing the efficiency and transparency of transatlantic economic cooperation and to accelerating the reduction and elimination of barriers to international trade and investment with the ultimate objective of achieving a barrier free transatlantic market .
since the establishment of the new transatlantic agenda ( nta ) in 1995 , there have been a number of new trc initiatives , all aimed at removing or reducing regulatory barriers to trade .
it is presented in seven parts: the first section describes the nature and scope of u.s. - eu regulatory barriers ; the second section explains the rationale for regulatory cooperation ; the third section highlights the differences in u.s. - eu regulatory approaches ; the fourth section examines the various forms of regulatory cooperation ; the fifth section evaluates the results of past initiatives at regulatory cooperation ; the sixth section analyzes the creation and operation of the transatlantic economic council ; and the last section highlights the role of congress in transatlantic regulatory cooperation .
these efforts , falling under the rubric of transatlantic regulatory cooperation ( trc ) , are seen as being important to today's u.s. - eu economic relationship .
proponents maintain that trc undertakings can not only prevent disruptive and costly trade disputes from occurring , but also spur trade and investment flows by reducing costs for producers and consumers on both sides of the atlantic .
much could depend upon whether the tec can exert enough political leverage to convince regulators to make reforms that will result in reduction of regulatory barriers between the eu and the united states , as well as increase the role that legislators on both sides of the atlantic play in the process .
while each of these initiatives has made some progress toward reducing regulatory burdens , many u.s. and european companies heavily engaged in the transatlantic marketplace maintain that the results have not been materially significant .
regulatory differences are also behind some of the most politically sensitive bilateral trade disputes .
