the u.s. congress has a long history of engagement on u.s. policy toward sudan — since the end of apartheid in south africa , there is no country in africa on which congress has focused more sustained attention .
this bipartisan focus has been driven in part by diverse advocacy groups and public awareness campaigns on issues in sudan ranging from famine to modern - day slavery , religious persecution , genocide , and other violations of human rights and humanitarian law .
prior to the secession of south sudan , sudan was africa's largest nation by area , and the site of its longest running civil war .
the secession of south sudan was a major financial blow to sudan , which lost 75% of its oil production , two - thirds of its export earnings , and half of its fiscal revenues .
u.s. sanctions limit sudan's access to u.s. dollars and , alongside debt arrears , impede sudan's access to international financial markets and institutions .
mistrust between sudan and south sudan lingers , and unresolved disputes still threaten the stability of the region .
the north - south split did not resolve other simmering sudanese conflicts , notably in darfur , blue nile , and southern kordofan ( see figure 1 ) .
terrorism concerns have overlapped the policy debates .
overlapping struggles between security forces and armed groups , among ethnic groups , and between nomadic and farming communities have caused extensive displacement and human suffering .
the country carries a heavy external debt burden of $45 billion ( 78% of gdp ) , much of it in arrears .
after the united states levied heavy fines against the french bank bnp paribas in 2014 for violating u.s. sanctions against sudan and other countries , most foreign banks stopped transacting with sudanese banks , tightening the foreign exchange market and adversely affecting its trade .
iran has reportedly played a significant role in the development of sudan's military industry ( sudan now ranks as the third largest weapons manufacturer on the continent , after egypt and south africa ) .
khartoum's internal military operations against restive regions continue to draw international condemnation and have prevented sudan from improving relations with many western countries , including the united states .
relations between sudan and key arab gulf countries , which have been important sources of trade , investment , and project financing for khartoum , had cooled in recent years amid some arab countries' concerns over sudan's ties to iran and its perceived support for the muslim brotherhood in other countries .
while annual aid appropriations measures continue to include provisions restricting u.s. aid to the government of sudan , congress has not passed standalone sudan legislation since 2007 ( prior to the outbreak of the conflict in the two areas ) .
khartoum has since taken several conspicuous steps to address concerns about its relationship with iran , including by expelling iran's cultural attaché in september 2014 and closing its cultural centers in the country .
the ongoing cost of waging war on multiple fronts compounds sudan's economic troubles and , combined with allegations of political repression , fuels domestic criticism of the government and sparks periodic public protests .
