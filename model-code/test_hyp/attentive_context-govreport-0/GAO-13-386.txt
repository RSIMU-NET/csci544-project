the federal employees' compensation act ( feca ) program provides workers' compensation coverage to approximately 2.8 million federal and postal employees for work - related injuries and illnesses .
benefits include wage - loss benefits , medical benefits , vocational - rehabilitation benefits , and survivors' benefits .
in fiscal year 2012 , the feca program made more than $2.1 billion in wage - loss compensation payments to claimants .
the program , administered by the department of labor ( labor ) , provides benefits to federal employees who sustained injuries or illnesses while performing their federal duties .
postal service represents over 40 percent ( approximately $14.4 billion ) of these estimated liabilities .
labor's office of workers' compensation programs ( owcp ) estimated that future actuarial liabilities for government - wide feca compensation payments to those receiving benefits as of fiscal year 2012 would total over $34 billion ( this amount does not include any costs for workers added to the feca rolls in future years ) ; the u.s .
federal agencies' offices of inspector general ( ig ) have identified programmatic deficiencies at the employing department and at labor that may make the program vulnerable to fraud and abuse .
this report is a follow - up to our january 2012 report identifying potential vulnerabilities in the program's design and controls that could increase the risk for fraud and promising practices that could help to reduce the risk of fraud within the feca program .
for those claims that are approved , employing agencies reimburse labor for payments made to their employees , while labor bears most of the program's administrative costs .
to answer this objective , we determined whether individuals potentially received improper payments , potentially committed fraud , or received overlapping payments by comparing feca data to quarterly wage ( qw ) and unemployment insurance ( ui ) data from selected states .
to identify factors that may have contributed to potentially improper or overlapping benefits , and how , if at all , labor could address these factors , we conducted interviews with officials from labor's owcp and employment and training agency ( eta ) , and reviewed prior inspector general ( ig ) and gao reports .
this report addresses the following question: what examples , if any , of improper payments , potential fraud , or overlapping benefits can be found in the feca program , what factors may contribute to these issues , and how , if at all , could labor address these factors ? .
we also reviewed labor's oversight mechanisms , which establish policies , guidelines , and procedures for adjudicating and managing claims under the feca program and compared them with those outlined in the standards for internal control in the federal government .
in addition , we conducted investigations of 3 of the 51 ( 19 ui and 32 qw ) individual cases .
we identified 530 individuals who had received concurrent feca wage - loss compensation payments and wage payments of at least $5,000 for the 1-year period ( i.e. , july 2009 to june 2010 ) we then randomly selected up to seven claimants from each of the five states for an in - depth review , for a total of 32 cases .
