specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) how much and for what purposes federal funding was provided for the restoration of the south florida ecosystem from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1999 and ( 2 ) how well the restoration effort is being coordinated and managed .
one of this administration's most significant environmental initiatives is the restoration of the south florida ecosystem .
the water resources development act of 1996 formalized the task force and expanded its membership to include state , local , and tribal representatives and charged it with coordinating and facilitating the efforts to restore the ecosystem .
responding to growing signs of the deterioration of this ecosystem , federal agencies established the south florida ecosystem restoration task force in 1993 to coordinate ongoing federal restoration activities in this area , such as modifying the effects of engineering projects that have diverted water from the everglades and reducing agricultural pollutants in the water entering wildlife refuges and the everglades .
because of the large number of federal , state , tribal , and local stakeholders involved in the south florida ecosystem restoration task force and the complexity and potential cost of the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative , you asked us to review the status of the restoration effort .
our analysis of the federal funding provided to the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative covers the period from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1999 .
although we included data on the agencies' appropriations through fiscal year 1999 , we included data on obligations and expenditures through fiscal year 1998 because complete data are available only through fiscal year 1998 .
in addition , because this study represents an initial look at this major initiative , you asked us to identify any other issues that might impede the progress of this effort in the future .
these include ( 1 ) outlining how the restoration will occur , ( 2 ) identifying the resources needed to achieve the restoration , ( 3 ) assigning accountability for accomplishing actions , and ( 4 ) linking the strategic goals established by the task force to outcome - oriented annual goals .
as stated in the report , without some means to resolve these disagreements in a timely manner , problems such as those encountered in implementing the two projects could continue to hinder the initiative .
while the task force has published several documents and is in the process of developing other strategies and plans to address specific restoration issues , it has not yet developed an overall strategic plan to guide the restoration effort .
such a plan for the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative has not yet been developed .
without some means to resolve agencies' disagreements and conflicts in a timely manner , problems such as those encountered in implementing the projects we reviewed could continue to hinder the initiative .
the agencies also strongly disagreed with our conclusion that additional delays and cost overruns are likely to occur in the future and that the ability to accomplish the initiative's overall goals is at risk .
success in the making also describes the strategies — adaptive management and innovative management — that the task force and its partners have adopted to achieve these long - term goals .
