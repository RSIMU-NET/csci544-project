in performing our work , we ( 1 ) evaluated lsc's control environment , information and communications , and risk assessment procedures related to its grants management and oversight organizations ; ( 2 ) reviewed lsc's control activities for monitoring grantee management and compliance , and ( 3 ) performed limited reviews at 14 grantees .
the legal services corporation's ( lsc ) mission is to make federal funding available to support the provision of legal assistance in civil matters to low - income people throughout the united states on everyday legal problems .
thus , lsc is accountable for the effectiveness of the internal controls over the grants process and for providing oversight and monitoring of grantees' internal controls , use of grant funds , and compliance with laws and regulations .
lsc pursues this mission by making grants to legal service providers ( grant recipients or grantees ) who serve low - income members of the community who would otherwise not be able to afford legal assistance ( clients ) .
this report contains the results of our review of internal controls over the legal services corporation's ( lsc ) grantee monitoring and oversight function and our limited visits to grantees .
lsc received $348.6 million in appropriations for fiscal year 2007 and $326.6 million in fiscal year 2006 .
you also asked us to conduct limited reviews of grantees' internal controls and fiscal practices .
established by a federal charter in 1974 as a federally funded , private nonprofit corporation , lsc is highly dependent on federal appropriations for its operations .
for fiscal year 2006 , lsc received 99 percent of its funding from federal appropriations and approximately 1 percent from grants through the department of veterans affairs .
effective grants - oversight procedures and monitoring , including a structured , systematic approach based on risk , are necessary given lsc's limited resources and the scope of its responsibilities for many widely dispersed entities .
absent timely communications about findings from its site visits , grantee management does not have information about deficiencies and corrective actions needed to address identified deficiencies in their use of funds and improve controls .
to help lsc improve its internal control and oversight of grantees , we recommend that the lsc board of directors develop and implement policies that clearly delineate organizational roles and responsibilities for grantee oversight and monitoring , including grantee internal controls and compliance .
in 2006 , lsc served clients through 138 grantees with more than 900 offices serving all 50 states , the district of columbia , and current and former u.s. territories .
lsc is responsible for ensuring that grant funds are being used for their intended purposes and in accordance with laws and regulations .
this report responds to your request that we review internal controls over lsc's grants management and oversight processes and assess whether those controls provide reasonable assurance that grant funds are being used for their intended purposes and in accordance with laws and regulations .
while control deficiencies at the grantees were the immediate cause of improper and potentially improper expenditures , weaknesses in lsc's oversight controls discussed above negatively affected the effectiveness of its monitoring of grantees' controls and compliance .
