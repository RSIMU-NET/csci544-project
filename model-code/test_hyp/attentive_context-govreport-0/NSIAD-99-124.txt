2469a and other applicable laws and regulations , ( 3 ) appropriate consideration was given to factors other than cost , and ( 4 ) award resulted in the lowest total cost to the department of defense ( dod ) for performance of the work .
this report is a redacted version of a report issued on november 23 , 1998 , which contained sensitive and protected information .
the report responds to one of several requirements in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 relating to depot maintenance activities .
specifically , we assessed whether the ( 1 ) air force's procedures for conducting the sacramento competition provided substantially equal opportunity for the public and private offerors to compete for the work without regard to performance location , ( 2 ) procedures for conducting the competition were in compliance with 10 u.s.c .
as required , we reviewed the air force's selection of a source of repair for depot maintenance work at the closing sacramento air logistics center ( alc ) , mcclellan air force base , california .
questions relate to estimating costs for ( 1 ) overhead , ( 2 ) commodity rate risk , ( 3 ) warehousing , ( 4 ) base operating support , and ( 5 ) material surcharge .
for these cost elements , we ( 1 ) discussed with members of the evaluation team , the methodology they used in determining the evaluated cost ; ( 2 ) reviewed the calculations and supporting documentation for the various cost elements ; ( 3 ) attempted to independently collect data to corroborate the evaluated cost estimates , where warranted ; and ( 4 ) offered to discuss competition issues with both the public and private sector competitors .
the team based the reductions primarily on ( 1 ) the defense contract audit agency's ( dcaa ) assessment of ogden's overhead savings analysis , ( 2 ) its decision to limit the number of years overhead savings would be considered , and ( 3 ) its assessment of boeing aircraft's proposed cost savings on the c - 17 maintenance program .
however , the selection decision would not have been affected by these questions .
overall , the air force's evaluation and selection of ogden appeared to be reasonable , fair , and consistent with the solicitation and depot competition procedures .
therefore , these cases had no impact on the award decision .
as a result of a 1995 base realignment and closure ( brac ) act decision , the sacramento and san antonio alcs , including their maintenance depots , are to close by 2001 .
these issues relate primarily to refining cost estimating methodologies and using more accurate data .
however , we present them as potential opportunities for improving cost estimates for future competitions .
to mitigate the impact of the closings on the local communities and employees , the administration announced its intention to maintain employment levels by privatizing the maintenance depots' workloads in place at each location .
ogden's total evaluated cost of $1,794,488,861 for the competed sacramento depot maintenance workloads was about 6 percent less than lockheed's evaluated cost of $1,902,848,080 .
the air force evaluation team reduced ogden's projection of overhead savings by 85 percent â€” from $294.5 million to $46.2 million .
