the department of homeland security ( dhs ) estimated that as of january 2011 there were about 11.5 million aliens ( non - u.s. citizens ) living in the united states without lawful immigration status .
as of april 2012 , the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) had awarded four contracts and planned to award additional contracts to modernize its alien criminal response information management ( acrime ) system .
dhs's u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is responsible for apprehending and removing aliens who have violated immigration law .
to help ensure that ice acquires effective technology to support the secure communities program and effectively uses its workforce , we recommend that the director of ice take the following three actions to follow sound management practices: establish well - defined requirements prior to awarding additional develop an integrated master schedule that identifies all tasks to be performed by the government and current and future contractors , and links activities being performed by different contractors ; and develop a workforce plan to support the analysis of immigration status determinations under secure communities .
developing a workforce plan to guide workforce resource decisions could help ensure workforce decisions are made in an effective and cost - efficient manner .
ice has invested millions of dollars to modernize acrime capabilities that are central to secure communities' success , but has not followed best practices in its acquisition of the modernized technology .
in addition to secure communities , ice's criminal alien program ( cap ) is designed to identify , process , and remove criminal aliens from prisons across the united states ; the national fugitive operations program is to pursue known at - large criminal aliens and fugitive aliens ; and the 287 ( g ) program , authorized by section 287 ( g ) of the immigration and nationality act , is to provide state and local law enforcement agency officers with delegation of authority , training , and resources to perform certain functions of an immigration officer .
 ( 2 ) to what extent has ice adhered to best practices to acquire secure communities â€“ related technology ? .
dhs , office of the inspector general , communication regarding participation in secure communities , oig - 12-66 ( washington , d.c.: march 2012 ) , and operations of united states immigration and customs enforcement's secure communities , oig - 12-64 ( washington , d.c.: april 2012 ) ( revised ) .
dhs concurred with our three recommendations and described efforts underway to address them .
likewise , a modernized acrime , along with the extension of secure communities to all jurisdictions , will change ice workforce requirements for the analysis of immigration status determinations .
 ( 3 ) what safeguards , if any , does ice have in place to protect against potential civil rights abuses under secure communities ? .
effective management of future acrime modernization efforts hinges on establishing well - defined requirements and the development of a reliable integrated master schedule .
this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) what trends can be identified in ice's enforcement actions related to the secure communities program ? .
the schedule delays and cost increases can be attributed in part to weaknesses in ice's planning , including ice ( 1 ) not fully defining requirements before awarding contracts and ( 2 ) not developing an integrated master schedule .
