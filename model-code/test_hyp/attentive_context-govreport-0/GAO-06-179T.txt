we issued two additional reports in september on ( 1 ) u.s. reconstruction efforts in the water and sanitation sector and ( 2 ) u.s. assistance for the january 2005 iraqi elections .
in july 2005 , we issued two reports on ( 1 ) the status of funding and reconstruction efforts in iraq , focusing on the progress we have achieved and the challenges we face in rebuilding iraq's infrastructure and ( 2 ) the use of private security providers in iraq .
based on these five reports , i will discuss ( 1 ) the funding used to rebuild and stabilize iraq and ( 2 ) the challenges the united states faces in its rebuilding and stabilization efforts .
the united states , along with its coalition partners and various international organizations , has undertaken a challenging and costly effort to stabilize and rebuild iraq following multiple wars and decades of neglect by the former regime .
the united states reconstruction assistance goal is to help the iraqi government develop a democratic , stable , and prosperous country , at peace with itself and its neighbors , a partner in the war against terrorism , enjoying the benefits of a free society and a market economy .
finally , we expect to issue a report shortly on u.s. efforts to stabilize the security situation in iraq ( a classified report ) .
specifically , we will examine the efforts to stabilize iraq and develop its security forces , including the challenge of ensuring that iraq can independently fund , sustain , and support its new security forces ; examine the management of the u.s. rebuilding effort , including program execution ; and assess the progress made in developing iraq's energy sectors , including the sectors' needs , existing resources and contributions , achievements , and future challenges .
this enormous effort is taking place in an unstable security environment , concurrent with iraqi efforts to complete a constitutional framework for establishing a permanent government .
my testimony today is based on several reports that we have issued to the congress over the past 3 months .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the u.s. efforts to rebuild and stabilize iraq .
as of august 2005 , approximately $30 billion in u.s. appropriations had been made available for rebuilding and stabilization needs in iraq , about $21 billion had been obligated , and about $13 billion had been disbursed .
we will continue to examine the challenges the united states faces in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
this statement includes unclassified information only and is based on recent gao reports .
second , inadequate performance data and measures make it difficult to determine the overall progress and impact of u.s. reconstruction efforts .
third , the u.s. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with iraq's inability to sustain new and rehabilitated infrastructure projects and to address maintenance needs in the water , sanitation , and electricity sectors .
u.s. appropriated funding has largely focused on infrastructure repair and training of iraqi security forces and this funding has been reallocated as priorities changed .
these funds were used for activities that included infrastructure repair of the electricity , oil , and water and sanitation sectors ; infrastructure repair , training , and equipping of the security and law enforcement sector ; and cpa and u.s. administrative expenses .
