the railroad retirement board ( rrb ) , an independent federal agency , administers these benefits .
the railroad retirement act authorizes retirement , survivor , and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families .
these benefits are earned by railroad workers and their families in lieu of social security .
workers covered by the rrb include those employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries , railroad associations , and railroad labor organizations .
the tier i railroad retirement benefit that is equivalent to social security benefits is mainly finance by tier i payroll taxes ( typically the same rate as the 12.4% social security payroll tax ) and social security's financial interchange transfers .
tier ii benefits , tier i benefits in excess of social security benefits , and supplemental annuities are mainly financed by tier ii payroll taxes ( currently 13.1% on employers and 4.9% on employees ) and transfers from the national railroad retirement investment trust ( nrrit ; hereinafter , the trust ) .
for example , rrb beneficiaries may receive unreduced tier i retirement benefits as early as aged 60 if they have at least 30 years of railroad service ; social security beneficiaries may receive unreduced retirement benefits only when they reach their full retirement ages , currently rising from aged 65 to 67 .
rrb tier ii benefits are similar to private pension benefits and are based only on railroad work .
railroad retirement benefits are divided into two tiers .
prior to the railroad retirement and survivors' improvement act of 2001 ( rrsia ; p.l .
in fy2017 , the trust's rate of return of 13.4% ( net of fees ) exceeded the benchmark of 12.3% .
tier i benefits are generally computed using the social security benefit formula , on the basis of earnings covered by either the railroad retirement or social security programs .
from its inception to the end of fy2017 , the trust has earned a total of $26.3 billion .
the trust then had negative rates of return in fy2008 ( - 19.1% ) and fy2009 ( - 0.7% ) but rebounded with an 11.2% rate of return in fy2010 followed by a slightly negative rate of return of - 0.1% in fy2011 .
at the end of fy2017 , the market value of the trust's managed assets was $26.5 billion .
for the first half of the trust's existence , its returns largely exceeded expectations .
since february 2002 when railroad retirement funds were first invested through the trust , a total of $21.3 billion has been transferred to the trust from the rrb , and $21.1 billion in earnings have been transferred from the trust to the rrb to pay railroad benefits and administrative expenses .
in some cases , rrb tier i benefits can be higher than comparable social security benefits .
as shown in figure 3 , in the majority of years between fy2003 and fy2017 , trust performances exceeded its strategic policy benchmarks .
the rrsia established the trust to manage and invest assets in the railroad retirement account in much the same way that the assets of private - sector retirement plans are invested .
