persons suspected of terrorist or criminal activity may be transferred from one state ( i.e. , country ) to another to answer charges against them .
besides receiving persons through rendition , the united states has also rendered persons to other countries over the years , via the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and various law enforcement agencies .
unlike in the case of rendition and extradition , the legal justification for removing an alien from the united states via deportation or denial of entry is not so that he can answer charges against him in the receiving state ; rather , it is because the united states possesses the sovereign authority to determine which non - nationals may enter or remain within its borders , and the alien fails to fulfill the legal criteria allowing non - citizens to enter , remain in , or pass in transit through the united states .
a distinct form of rendition is extradition , by which one state surrenders a person within its territorial jurisdiction to a requesting state via a formal legal process , typically established by treaty between the countries .
unlike in extradition cases , persons subject to this type of rendition typically have no access to the judicial system of the sending state by which they may challenge their transfer .
over the years , several persons have been rendered into the united states by u.s. authorities , often with the cooperation of the states where such persons were seized , to answer criminal charges , including charges related to terrorist activity .
although the deportation or exclusion of an alien under immigration laws may have the same practical effect as an irregular rendition ( especially if the alien is subject to "expedited removal" under § 235 of the immigration and nationality act , in which case judicial review of a removal order may be very limited ) , this practice is arguably distinct from the historical understanding of what constitutes a rendition .
the terms "irregular rendition" and "extraordinary rendition" have been used to refer to the extrajudicial transfer of a person from one state to another , generally for the purpose of arrest , detention , and / or interrogation by the receiving state ( for purposes of this report , the term "rendition" will be used to describe irregular renditions , and not extraditions , unless otherwise specified ) .
in contrast , noncitizens who have not entered the united states have historically been recognized as receiving few , if any , constitutional protections ( though noncitizens in foreign locations over which the united states exercises significant control , such as guantanamo bay , cuba , may be owed greater protections than other noncitizens abroad ) .
the surrender of a fugitive from one state to another is generally referred to as rendition .
in august , the task force issued recommendations to ensure that u.s. transfer practices comply with applicable standards and do not result in the transfer of persons to face torture .
on august 24 , 2009 , the special task force on interrogation and transfer polices issued its recommendations to the president , including with respect to the practice of rendition .
however , renditions may be effectuated in the absence of extradition treaties , as well .
