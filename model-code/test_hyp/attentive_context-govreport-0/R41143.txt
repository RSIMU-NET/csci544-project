the most prevalent pta today is a free trade agreement ( fta ) , such as the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) or the u.s. - australian fta .
preferential trade agreements ( ptas ) comprise a variety of unilateral , bilateral , or regional arrangements which favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences .
legislation granting the president authority to negotiate ftas expired in july 2007 and has not been renewed by congress .
all four ftas negotiated or under negotiation in 2007 — south korea , panama , columbia , and peru — have been approved by congress so the obama administration's major current trade initiative has been to engage in the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement negotiations .
given the need for the u.s. economy to rely on an increase in exports for faster growth , these concerns have also resonated in congress and the obama administration .
the world trade organization ( wto ) permits countries to enter into ptas under certain conditions , but the criteria are very elastic , and the examination by the wto as to their consistency with wto rules has not been rigorous .
if ptas , on balance , create more trade ( by allowing production to shift to the more competitive producers in the agreement ) than they divert ( by shifting trade from lower - cost non - pta members to higher - cost members because of tariff preferences extended to members ) , they are said to be a building block or complement for the world trading system .
a third section assesses the implications of the eu's pta program for the multilateral trading system and u.s. trade policy .
this is because the effects of the agreements on the patterns of trade and investment can depend on the content of the pta as well as the size and magnitude of the barriers being reduced .
what is not disputed is that ptas have grown and become the centerpiece of world trade diplomacy as countries seek to improve access to foreign markets for their exporters and investors .
in the meantime , calls from the u.s. business community sector have increased for a more activist u.s. fta policy , much out of fear of losing export sales and market share to eu competitors who may be gaining more favorable access to larger foreign markets as a result of new ptas .
as a result of its widespread ptas ( including unilateral preference programs ) , the eu trades with only 10 wto members where the most - favored - nation ( mfn ) regime applies in its entirety .
the main dispute is whether ptas serve as a building block or a stumbling block for further multilateral trade liberalization .
ptas are excepted under certain circumstances from the nondiscrimination clause of the multilateral world trading system .
as outlined in its 2006 global europe strategy , the eu targeted a number of larger countries and regions for negotiations , including south korea , india , canada , and the association of south east asian nations ( asean ) .
however , it is very difficult to determine quantitatively whether trade creation or trade diversion dominates in any particular pta .
