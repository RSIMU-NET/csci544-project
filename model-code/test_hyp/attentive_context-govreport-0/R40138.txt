the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) provides a statutory framework by which government agencies may , when gathering foreign intelligence for an investigation , obtain authorization to conduct electronic surveillance or physical searches , utilize pen registers and trap and trace devices , or access specified business records and other tangible things .
authorization for such activities is typically obtained via a court order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) , a specialized court created to act as a neutral judicial decisionmaker in the context of fisa .
that act and subsequent measures amended fisa to enable the government to obtain information in a greater number of circumstances .
perhaps in response to such concerns , congress established sunset provisions which apply to three of the most controversial amendments to fisa: section 6001 ( a ) of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( irtpa ) , also known as the "lone wolf" provision , which simplifies the evidentiary showing needed to obtain a fisa court order to target non - u.s. persons who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor , specifically by authorizing such orders in the absence of a proven link between a targeted individual and a foreign power ; section 206 of the usa patriot act , which permits multipoint , or "roving," wiretaps ( i.e. , wiretaps which may follow a target even when he or she changes phones ) by adding flexibility to the manner in which the subject of a fisa court order is specified ; and section 215 of the usa patriot act , which authorizes orders compelling a person to produce "any tangible thing" that is "relevant" to an authorized foreign intelligence , international terrorism , or counter - espionage investigation .
the controversy surrounding section 215 complicated efforts to reauthorize all three of the expiring provisions , and they eventually expired on june 1 , 2015 .
one day later , congress enacted the usa freedom act , which placed new limitations on the scope of the government's foreign intelligence activities , while simultaneously extending the expired provisions through december 15 , 2019 .
these provisions were originally set to expire on december 31 , 2005 , but were extended multiple times , with slight modifications , through june 1 , 2015 .
at the time of enactment , these expanded authorities prompted concerns regarding the appropriate balance between national security interests and civil liberties .
in summer 2013 , media began reporting on several foreign intelligence activities conducted by the national security agency ( nsa ) , including the bulk collection of telephone metadata under section 215 .
for example , in the context of roving wiretaps , section 105 ( c ) ( 2 ) of fisa would read as it did on october 25 , 2001 , eliminating the authority for fisa court orders to direct other unspecified persons to assist with electronic surveillance .
shortly after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , congress enacted the usa patriot act , in part , to "provid[e] enhanced investigative tools" to "assist in the prevention of future terrorist activities and the preliminary acts and crimes which further such activities. .
