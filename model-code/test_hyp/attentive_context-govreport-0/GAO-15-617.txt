our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess agencies' progress in achieving savings from their it reform efforts ; ( 2 ) evaluate the extent to which agencies have established plans to reinvest their savings ; and ( 3 ) evaluate how selected agencies have reinvested their savings , including the extent to which it governance processes are in place to oversee such reinvestments .
federal agencies spend over $80 billion annually to meet their increasing demand for information technology ( it ) .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess agencies' progress in achieving savings from their information technology ( it ) reform efforts ; ( 2 ) evaluate the extent to which agencies have established plans to reinvest their savings ; and ( 3 ) evaluate how selected agencies have reinvested their savings , including the extent to which it governance processes are in place to oversee such reinvestments .
specifically , omb and 12 agencies agreed with our recommendations , while 1 ( state ) did not state whether it agreed or disagreed , 3 had no comments , and 1 ( defense ) partially agreed .
in addition , we are making 22 recommendations to 17 of the departments and agencies in our review to improve their reinvestment planning and oversight .
specifically , we recommend that the director of omb direct the federal cio to ensure that agencies complete their reinvestment plans , in accordance with established requirements , and maintain those plans on an ongoing basis ; and require agencies to track actual reinvestment performance and define performance targets for agencies' reinvestments , as done previously .
beginning in 2010 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) launched a series of it reform initiatives intended to help agencies achieve greater efficiency in their it investments by , among other things , consolidating the growing number of federal data centers and increasing the use of cloud computing .
we received comments on a draft of our report from omb , the 17 agencies to which we made recommendations , and the remaining 10 that had no recommendations .
subsequently , gsa provided additional documentation that included reinvestment plans for all of its initiatives .
we have previously reported and testified that omb's it reform initiatives can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal government and have the potential to save billions of dollars .
this was based on the agency's quarterly integrated data collection submission to omb not including reinvestment plan information for 3 of the agency's 13 cost savings and avoidance initiatives .
while we acknowledge nrc's comments , this report focused on agencies' progress in achieving savings from their it reform efforts and did not review the adequacy of omb's guidance on reporting cost savings , including related cost definitions and categorizations .
until such requirements are in place , agencies may be challenged to ensure that their considerable savings are being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible and omb will be limited in its ability to ensure that agencies' reinvestments are occurring as planned .
given the importance of omb's it reform efforts , you asked us to review agencies' savings from such efforts and determine how agencies are reinvesting their savings .
