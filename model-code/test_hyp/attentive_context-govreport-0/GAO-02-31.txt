the decennial census is the nation's most comprehensive and expensive data - gathering program .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) update full - cycle costs to reflect the most current information and ( 2 ) analyze bureau data to determine the causes of the significant increase in cost per housing unit for the 2000 census when compared to the cost for the 1990 census .
as agreed with your offices , this report responds to your joint request for us to ( 1 ) update full - cycle costs to reflect the most current information and ( 2 ) analyze bureau data to determine the causes of the significant increase in cost per housing unit for the 2000 census when compared to the cost of the 1990 census to assist the bureau in planning for the 2010 census .
however , due to current , ongoing studies and evaluations of the 2000 census , it is too early to determine the full extent of improvements compared to the 1990 census .
from providing the basis for apportioning the u.s. house of representatives to providing data used by communities , businesses , and americans everywhere , the decennial census provides a great deal of knowledge about our nation .
for the 2000 census , costs for these four frameworks increased about 23-percent to about $920 million or about $8 of the total $56 per housing unit cost .
in a previous report , we estimated that when compared to the 1970 census , the projected full - cycle cost per housing unit of the 2000 census would quadruple and the total cost would nearly double the costs of the 1990 census .
the $1 cost increase for the 2000 census was due to increased bureau efforts to compile a complete and accurate address list and to plan , evaluate , and test aspects of the census design , including dress rehearsals .
further , the bureau is still assessing the quality of the 2000 census in its postenumeration review through fiscal year 2003 .
the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) update full - cycle costs and ( 2 ) analyze bureau data to determine the causes of the significant increase in cost per housing unit for the 2000 census when compared to the cost for the 1990 census .
the remaining frameworks 1 , 4 , 6 , and 7 contributed the remaining $1 of the $24 per housing unit cost increase for the 2000 census when compared to the 1990 census .
the $24 cost per housing unit increase was primarily the result of increased costs in four of the eight frameworks: ( 1 ) $16 for expanded field data collection methods , ( 2 ) $3 for the extensive use of technology and contractor support , referred to as automated data processing and telecommunications support , ( 3 ) $2 for more enhanced methods for data content and products , and ( 4 ) $2 for increases in marketing , communication , and partnership programs .
according to census officials , the significant cost increase can be attributed primarily to the bureau's attempt to achieve a better quality census than in 1990 .
