the department of education has a history of financial management problems , including serious internal control weaknesses , which have affected education's ability to provide reliable financial information to decisionmakers both inside and outside the agency and to maintain the financial integrity of its operations .
specifically , you asked us to assess the adequacy of internal controls over ( 1 ) grant and loan disbursements , ( 2 ) third party drafts , and ( 3 ) government purchase cards , and to determine if any fraudulent or otherwise improper payments were made in these areas .
because of this , we have designated education's student financial assistance programs as a high - risk area for waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
however , because the department has not effectively implemented its new policies , vulnerabilities remain .
given the billions of dollars in payments made by education each year to recipients nationwide and abroad , these known deficiencies raise the risk that fraudulent or erroneous payments could make their way undetected through education's processes .
while education has taken steps to develop new policies and procedures to address these problems , in many cases they are not being effectively implemented .
as the department has recognized , it must continually review its processes to ensure that the improved controls are sustained and , therefore , will help to reduce the department's vulnerability to fraudulent and improper payments and lost assets and improve its financial management overall .
you requested that we cover the period may 1998 through september 2000 during which time education disbursed $181.5 billion through these processes â€” $181.4 billion in grants and loans , $55 million in third party drafts , and $22 million in purchase card transactions .
in january 2002 , three employees pleaded guilty to a scheme in which they defrauded the department of more than $1 million during the 1990s , and , in 2000 , the department reported that $1.9 million meant for two school districts in south dakota was fraudulently wired to improper bank accounts .
the objectives of our review were to assess internal controls in place from may 1998 through september 2000 and to identify any fraudulent or otherwise improper payments that may have resulted from control weaknesses in education's processes for ( 1 ) disbursing grants and loans , ( 2 ) paying for purchases with third party drafts , and ( 3 ) use of government purchase cards .
control activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that enforce management's directives and help ensure that actions are taken to address risks .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
control activities are an integral part of an entity's planning , implementing , reviewing , and accountability for stewardship of government resources and achieving effective results .
internal control , which is synonymous with management control , helps government program managers achieve desired results through effective stewardship of public resources .
the department of education's mission is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation .
