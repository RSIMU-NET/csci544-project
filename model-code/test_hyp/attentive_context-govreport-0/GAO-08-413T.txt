specifically , strategic human capital transformation and related management reforms ; dod's new pay - for - performance system , known as the national security personnel system ( nsps ) ; contractors in the workforce ; and personnel security clearances are among the serious challenges going forward .
second , as requested , i will comment on the potential impact on gao's ability to perform audit work on personnel security clearances if the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) were to assume management of this issue from the office of management and budget ( omb ) .
first , gao has assisted congress for decades in its oversight role and helped federal departments and agencies with disparate missions to improve the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of their operations .
finally , given historical challenges to gao's ability to audit the intelligence community's programs and activities , i would like to discuss gao's views on senate bill s. 82 , known as the intelligence community audit act of 2007 .
specifically , we have performed in - depth reviews and issued reports on intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ) systems requirements , operations , and acquisitions ; on space acquisitions ; and on the space acquisition workforce â€” issues that are current and critical within the intelligence community .
my comments today are based primarily on gao's completed work and on our institutional knowledge , drawn from our prior reviews at the department of defense ( dod ) and other federal agencies of human capital management , personnel security clearances , and other areas that directly affect the intelligence community , as well as on publicly available reports .
you asked that i discuss how gao's expertise and capacity to perform program reviews of key governmentwide issues , as well as some recent work we have done related to intelligence activities , could be useful in assisting congressional oversight of intelligence community management reforms under consideration .
human capital transformation and personnel security clearances also have been repeatedly identified as areas of weakness within the intelligence community by others , including the subcommittee on oversight , house permanent select committee on intelligence ; the congressional research service ; and independent commissions .
 ( see the list of related gao products at the end of this statement. ) .
a number of the governmentwide management challenges we have addressed , such as human capital transformation , acquisition , information technology , strategic planning , organizational alignment , financial and knowledge management , and personnel security clearances , affect most federal agencies , including those within the intelligence community .
in addition , gao's work also provides important insight and foresight to complement the work we have performed for congress for many years .
we also have recently completed work on several management issues that are directly related to the intelligence community , and we have the capabilities to further support the intelligence and other appropriate congressional committees with their oversight needs .
for the most part , dod has agreed with our findings and recommendations .
moreover , we have designated some of these areas as high - risk for the federal government .
s. 82 , if enacted , would amend title 31 of the united states code to reaffirm gao's authority to audit and evaluate financial transactions , programs , and activities of the intelligence community .
