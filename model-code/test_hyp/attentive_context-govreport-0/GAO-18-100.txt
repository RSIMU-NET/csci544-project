generally , health care insurers set three types of cost - sharing parameters: ( 1 ) deductibles — costs a beneficiary is responsible for before the health insurance plan will start to pay any costs ; ( 2 ) coinsurance or copayments ( per - service payments ) once the deductible is met ; and ( 3 ) caps — limits on the maximum cost - sharing amount a beneficiary can be responsible for during a year for covered services .
specifically , groups have proposed that medicare ffs's cost - sharing design be simplified and include features found in private plans ( including in medicare advantage ( ma ) , the private plan alternative to medicare ffs ) , which have evolved over time to promote prudent use of health care services and protect beneficiaries from catastrophic care costs .
the direct effect of modernizing the medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) cost - sharing design ( i.e. , the effect when holding utilization and enrollment constant ) on beneficiaries' cost - sharing responsibilities would depend on the specific revisions and the time horizon examined .
gao and others have long noted concerns about the design of medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) cost - sharing — the portion of costs for covered services that beneficiaries are responsible for when they receive care .
this report describes 1. implications of the current medicare ffs cost - sharing design and options for modernizing while maintaining medicare's and beneficiaries' aggregate share of costs ; 2. how modernized cost - sharing designs could directly affect beneficiaries' cost - sharing responsibilities ; and 3. how modernized cost - sharing designs could indirectly affect beneficiaries' out - of - pocket costs .
modernizing medicare's cost - sharing design would have both direct and indirect effects on beneficiaries' costs .
to address these concerns , various groups have proposed revising medicare ffs's cost - sharing design , which has been largely unchanged from when medicare was enacted in 1965 .
medicare ffs's cost - sharing is complicated and not well designed to discourage unnecessary use of services .
these studies and experts identified several types of behavioral responses that would influence the net effect of a modernized design on beneficiaries' out - of - pocket costs , including changes in beneficiaries' demand for , and insurers' supply of , supplemental insurance ; changes in beneficiaries' utilization of services ; changes in medicare beneficiaries' enrollment in ffs versus ma ; and interactions among these and other behavioral responses , including effects on the price of supplemental insurance .
the indirect and direct effects together would determine how a modernized design would affect beneficiaries' total out - of - pocket costs for covered services ( the amount of cost - sharing paid directly by the beneficiary plus the premiums ( monthly fees ) that beneficiaries pay for their medicare coverage and other supplemental insurance they may have ) .
some studies have examined how modernizing medicare's cost - sharing design would affect beneficiaries financially ; however , they have primarily focused on first - year effects and may have understated the advantages to beneficiaries of adding an annual cost - sharing cap .
