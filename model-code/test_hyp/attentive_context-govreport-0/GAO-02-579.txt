the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides health care services to veterans who have been diagnosed with psychosis — primarily schizophrenia , a disorder that can substantially limit their ability to care for themselves , secure employment , and maintain relationships .
for many of them , effective treatment , especially antipsychotic drug therapy , has reduced the severity of their illnesses and increased their ability to function in society .
these veterans also have a high risk of premature death , including suicide .
since 1989 , new antipsychotic drugs have been approved in the united states .
in fiscal year 2001 , the amount for antipsychotic drugs jumped 29 percent to $158 million — or 7 percent of va's total drug costs .
to address these concerns , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) if va's clinical guideline for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is consistent with medical community practices for managing serious mental illnesses and ( 2 ) whether implementation of the guideline is consistent with its intent to ensure that prescribing decisions are ultimately based on physicians' clinical judgment .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
doing so might not detect individual facility policies that could restrict access to the more costly atypical antipsychotic drugs .
atypical antipsychotic drugs are essential to providing quality mental health care ; however , they vary significantly in cost .
to ensure that veterans with mental disorders receive the most appropriate yet cost - effective drug , va issued a guideline in july 2001 for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs for newly diagnosed patients or for patients not responding favorably to their current medication .
in fiscal year 2000 , va spent $1.1 billion to provide psychiatric care for almost 200,000 veterans with psychosis .
however , atypical antipsychotic drugs are expensive , and the cost differences among them can vary significantly .
all atypical antipsychotic drugs are on va's national formulary , except the newest , which is available through nonformulary approval processes .
overall , atypical antipsychotic drugs are more costly than traditional antipsychotic drugs .
of this amount , $123 million was spent on antipsychotic drugs .
however , procedures at a few facilities have limited or could restrict access to certain atypical antipsychotic drugs on va's national formulary because of cost considerations .
in fiscal year 1999 , 62 percent of all antipsychotic drug prescriptions were for atypical drugs ; by fiscal year 2001 , more than 80 percent were for atypical drugs .
over the last few years , the number of prescriptions for atypical antipsychotic drugs has increased dramatically in va .
you asked us to review whether this guideline may result in restricted access to the more costly atypical antipsychotic drugs and , in turn , adversely affect the quality of care for veterans .
such procedures are contrary to va's prescribing guideline for atypical antipsychotic drugs .
antipsychotic drugs — both traditional and atypical — are va's third most expensive class of drugs .
each has been proven effective in clinical trials , but effectiveness appears to depend on the particular patient .
