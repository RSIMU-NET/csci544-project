the objectives of our review were to determine ( 1 ) what is known about the effectiveness of ignition interlocks in reducing alcohol - impaired driving and ( 2 ) the extent to which the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) has assisted states in implementing ignition - interlock programs , including the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) ignition - interlock grant program .
this report discusses ( 1 ) what is known about the effectiveness of ignition interlocks in reducing alcohol - impaired driving and ( 2 ) the extent to which nhtsa has assisted states in implementing ignition - interlock programs , including the map - 21 ignition - interlock grant program .
for such states , the incentive and relatively limited funding offered by the grant is not likely to outweigh the challenges of changing state ignition - interlock laws to eliminate exemptions .
according to the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) , all states have enacted legislation requiring or permitting the use of ignition interlocks .
most recently , the 2012 surface transportation reauthorization act — moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) — also included funding for a new grant program for states with laws mandating that all drivers convicted of dwi be allowed to drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock .
historically , congress has provided funds for state programs to reduce alcohol - impaired driving .
in light of the toll alcohol - impaired driving takes , you asked us to review the effectiveness of ignition interlocks and nhtsa's implementation of the map - 21 ignition - interlock program .
while the number of such fatalities has dropped by 21 percent over the last 10 years , almost one third of all traffic fatalities annually resulted from crashes involving an alcohol - impaired driver over the same period .
this recommendation was intended to provide congress with more complete information as it considers reauthorizing surface transportation programs , including the ignition - interlock grant program .
nhtsa assists states in implementing these programs and , in addition to other safety organizations , has funded research examining the effectiveness of ignition - interlock programs .
specifically , dot provided the digest of impaired driving and selected beverage control laws , which is a compilation of comprehensive information on states' impaired - driving laws .
included in the draft report was a recommendation that the secretary of transportation provide congress with information about the extent to which states' ignition interlock laws allow exemptions .
california first piloted the use of ignition interlocks in 1986 for drivers convicted of driving while intoxicated ( dwi ) .
nhtsa administers safety - incentive grant programs to assist states in their efforts to reduce traffic - related fatalities , including alcohol - impaired fatalities .
to identify the types of assistance that nhtsa provides to states to help them establish and implement their ignition - interlock programs , we interviewed nhtsa officials about their activities and reviewed reports describing nhtsa's ignition - interlock - related research , technical assistance , and conferences .
to identify what is known about the effectiveness of ignition interlocks , we reviewed 25 studies conducted between 1990 and 2013 that analyzed relationships between ignition interlock devices or programs and alcohol - impaired driving outcomes , including dwi arrests and dwi fatalities .
