the federal election commission ( fec ) is a six - member independent regulatory agency .
the commission is responsible for administering federal campaign finance law and for civil enforcement of the federal election campaign act ( feca ) .
one nomination is pending , and the status of future departures remains unclear .
as of this writing , the commission again faces a potential loss of its policymaking quorum because only four commissioners remain in office .
in 2008 , the fec lost its policymaking quorum for six months .
these developments notwithstanding , it is unclear whether the agency will lose more commissioners .
commissioners are appointed by the president and are subject to senate confirmation .
congress created the fec in 1974 , after controversial fundraising during 1960s presidential campaigns and the early 1970s watergate scandal .
the fec also discloses campaign finance data to the public , conducts compliance training , and administers public financing for participating presidential campaigns .
the topic may be relevant for congressional oversight of the agency , particularly if it loses its policymaking quorum , and for senate consideration of nominations to the agency .
feca requires that at least four of the six commissioners vote to make decisions on substantive actions .
feca establishes six - year terms for commission members .
other crs products provide additional information about campaign finance policy , the fec , and procedural issues .
vacancies make the task harder by reducing opportunities for a coalition of at least four votes .
because feca also requires bipartisan commission membership , achieving at least four agreeing votes is sometimes difficult , even with six members present .
commissioners may continue in "holdover" status after those terms end .
this report provides a brief overview of the fec's policymaking powers without at least four commissioners in office .
this includes deciding on enforcement actions , advisory opinions , and rulemaking matters .
in particular , this includes holding hearings ; making , amending , or repealing rules ; initiating litigation or defending the commission in litigation , including appeals ; issuing advisory opinions ; conducting investigations , and making referrals to other enforcement agencies ; approving enforcement actions and audits ; and issuing and amending forms ( e.g. , those used in the disclosure process ) .
members of the congressional leadership or committees of jurisdiction ( the house committee on house administration and senate rules and administration committee ) apparently continue to influence the appointment process .
during the loss of the commission's policymaking quorum in 2008 , the two remaining commissioners ( david mason ( r ) and ellen weintraub ( d ) ) met publicly to discuss advisory opinions , but could not vote to issue those opinions .
congress originally designed eight positions for the fec: six commissioners and two nonvoting ex officio members ( the clerk of the house and secretary of the senate ) .
ravel's term would have expired on april 30 , 2017 .
the fec currently retains its policymaking quorum .
it is unclear whether any other commissioners currently plan to leave .
the current vacancies developed as follows: effective february 28 , 2017 , democratic commissioner ann m. ravel resigned , leaving the agency with five members .
