this testimony addresses ( 1 ) the specific efforts of u.s. agencies to improve intellectual property protection in other nations , ( 2 ) the means used to coordinate these efforts , and ( 3 ) challenges facing enforcement efforts abroad .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on u.s. efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property rights ( ipr ) overseas .
the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property through means such as copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
 ; a report prepared by a department of justice intellectual property task force , and congressional action concerning an interagency intellectual property law enforcement council .
as a result , u.s. goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy in many countries .
as you know , the united states dominates the creation and export of intellectual property — creations of the mind .
however , protection of intellectual property in many parts of the world is inadequate .
the agencies are the departments of commerce , state , justice , and homeland security ; ustr ; the copyright office ; the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) ; and the u.s. international trade commission .
the u.s. government , through numerous agencies , is seeking better intellectual property protection overseas .
in addition , this testimony , based on our september 2004 report addressing these topics , provides an update on key ipr - related events since that time — an administration initiative referred to as the strategy targeting organized piracy , or stop ! .
eight federal agencies , as well as the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) and the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , undertake the primary u.s. government activities to protect and enforce u.s. intellectual property rights overseas .
to understand more fully how u.s. agencies have performed in this regard , we have examined several issues .
to address these issues , we analyzed key u.s. government reports and documents from eight federal agencies and two offices .
we also conducted field work in four countries where serious problems regarding the protection of intellectual property have been reported ( brazil , china , russia , and ukraine ) and met with u.s. embassy and foreign government officials as well as representatives of u.s. companies and industry groups operating in those countries .
the united states has brought a total of 12 ipr cases to the wto for resolution , but has not brought any since 2000 ( although the united states initiated a wto dispute panel for one of these cases in 2003 ) .
fully implementing some of the report's recommendations will require a sustained , long - term effort by justice .
key activities to develop and promote enhanced ipr protection in foreign countries are undertaken by the departments of commerce , homeland security , justice , and state ; the fbi ; uspto ; the copyright office ; and usaid .
we subsequently updated our work in may and june of 2005 by meeting with key government officials and industry groups involved in recent u.s. government efforts .
conversely , niplecc , the mechanism for coordinating intellectual property law enforcement , has accomplished little that is concrete and its ineffectiveness continues despite recent congressional action to provide funding , staffing , and clearer guidance regarding its international objectives .
