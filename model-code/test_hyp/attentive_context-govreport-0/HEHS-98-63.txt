recent sharp increases in the annual volume of new federal student loans suggest that the cumulative amounts of student debt may be rising as well .
our review was based in large part on our analysis of data collected by the department of education as part of the national postsecondary student aid study ( npsas ) .
in august 1996 we reported that tuition increases at 4-year public colleges had outstripped increases in household income , and parents and others were questioning how students and their families would find the money to pay for school .
in response to this concern , you asked us to answer the following questions: what changes have occurred in recent years in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who borrow and in the cumulative amount of their borrowing ? .
we chose 1992-93 for a comparison because it ( 1 ) predated the most recent round of increases in maximum limits on the amounts of loans available through the government's major student loan programs , and ( 2 ) like 1995-96 , was a year in which the department identified students who had graduated from their academic programs .
what changes have occurred in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who work and the number of hours they work ? .
how do undergraduate borrowing and work patterns differ by type of school , year in school , dependency status , family income , and race / ethnicity ? .
we reported , for example , that tuition increased 234 percent from school year 1980-81 through 1994-95 , in contrast to median household income , which rose 82 percent during this period .
what information is available concerning the amounts of education debt parents incur ? .
we focused on 1995-96 because it was the most recent year for which data were available .
the use of these survey data allowed us to estimate averages for the student population as a whole , as well as narrow the comparison to groups that had completed their educational programs .
we focused our analysis primarily on two academic or student years: 1992-93 and 1995-96 .
the survey does not make a distinction between debt for postsecondary education and debt for elementary and secondary education , nor does it distinguish between debt owed by parents for a child's education and debt owed by parents for their own education .
excluding first mortgages , u.s. home equity debt totaled about $255 billion in 1993 , $110 billion of which was in home equity lines of credit and $145 billion in traditional home equity loans .
changes in students' employment have been less pronounced than changes in borrowing .
in contrast with the substantial amount of information about students' own borrowing experiences , little information is available about the amounts that parents borrow to pay for their children's postsecondary education .
appendix ii provides additional data , including confidence intervals , for the estimates presented .
in general , studies that provide data on parents' education debt were dated or limited in scope , and they often failed to differentiate between postsecondary education debt and other types of education debt .
however , this factor accounted for only about 11 percent of the difference in the amounts of borrowing that occurred , after controlling for other factors .
