it also provides the projected effects of the options on social security and ssi benefit levels and eligibility in 2042 , and the interaction between the two programs .
these four options were chosen to illustrate different approaches to mitigating poverty in a benefit cut scenario , allowing policymakers to see the potential pros and cons of generic options .
the details of each option could be modified or combined with other provisions .
this analysis does not cover potential transition issues nor the cost of the options modeled .
the following section describes each of the four options crs modeled .
one way to measure such targeting is to compare the estimated effects of potential policy options on the elderly poor vs. the elderly non - poor .
if one of the objectives of reforming social security were to mitigate the effect of possible benefit reductions on the elderly poor , targeting spending would become an important consideration .
in addition , social security faces long - term solvency problems .
in nearly all cases , their increased social security benefits are projected to result in reduced ssi benefits or loss of ssi eligibility .
each additional dollar of social security benefits could reduce ssi recipients' benefits by one dollar ( or more , after factoring in state supplements ) , and could disqualify some recipients for ssi altogether .
other ways of analyzing the targeting of an option include measuring the poverty gap and looking at the proportion of people who fall below a given percentage of the poverty threshold ( e.g. , 150% or 200% of poverty ) .
under option #1 , which would create a new minimum social security benefit at the poverty line , about two - thirds of the poor elderly ( 68% ) are projected to be unaffected .
ultimately , future elderly poverty rates depend largely on how policymakers choose to address social security's looming solvency problems .
once those decisions are made , the tradeoffs between any options to mitigate the effects of potential benefit cuts would be judged based on their effectiveness , efficiency , cost , and on policymakers' judgments about a myriad of other factors .
among the non - poor elderly , most ( 84% ) are projected not to be affected , as shown in figure 8 .
the remaining 5% of the elderly poor are projected to lose income under the option .
in addition to considering benefit levels , poverty rates , and targeting , as examined above , policymakers examining the potential effects of social security reform on the elderly poor would likely consider other criteria when discussing policy changes to either social security or ssi .
figure 7 shows the elderly poor , the target group for the modeled policy options .
the income measure shows the projected net change in income under each option , including both social security and ssi benefits , so these projections reflect the interaction between the two programs .
the federal budget is currently in deficit and is projected to remain so in the future .
among the non - poor elderly , most ( 91% ) are projected not to be affected , as shown in figure 8 .
