our work did not specifically address the veteran's gulf war illness issue ; however , we did address some issues common to those contained in your february 15 , 1996 , interim report such as inadequate detection equipment , and problems of transitioning from investigational new drug vaccine status to food and drug administration approved vaccines .
we appreciate the opportunity to provide our assessment of the capability of u.s. forces to fight and survive while under attack by chemical and biological agents .
as you know , during the persian gulf conflict ( 1 ) many units arrived in the persian gulf without needed protective equipment and adequate training , ( 2 ) plans to vaccinate personnel to protect them from the effects of biological agents were inadequate , and ( 3 ) medical units lacked the ability to treat casualties in a chemically or biologically contaminated environment .
u.s. forces still lack the ability to defend adequately against chemical and / or biological agents and a degraded war - fighting capability could still result from persistent equipment , training , and medical shortcomings .
u.s. forces would have been highly vulnerable to chemical or biological attack had they not had 6 months after arrival in the gulf to deal with these shortcomings before offensive operations began .
although the department of defense ( dod ) is taking steps to improve the readiness of u.s. ground forces to conduct operations in a chemical or biological environment , units designated for early deployment today face many of the same problems that were experienced during the persian gulf conflict in 1990 and 1991 .
today u.s. forces face a continually increasing threat of chemical and biological warfare .
dod has spent less than 1 percent of its budget on chemical and biological warfare defense , and over the period 1992-1995 , funding in real terms decreased by 30 percent .
a steadily increasing number of potential enemies now possess the technologies and capabilities to produce and deliver a wide range of chemical and biological agents .
this situation is a result of the inconsistent but generally lower priority dod — especially the joint chiefs of staff ( jcs ) and the war - fighting commanders in chief ( cinc ) — assigns chemical and biological defense compared to other high priority activities , such as performing traditional operational mission tasks .
this is evidenced by the limited funding , staffing , and mission priority chemical and biological defense activities receive .
the salient details on past and present problems in the u.s. defense against chemical and biological warfare are discussed below .
it is unclear whether or when dod will approve these plans .
shortcomings in chemical and biological defense are likely to continue unless the secretary of defense and the jcs chairman specifically assign a higher priority to this area .
our work gives us no reason to expect dod to place greater emphasis on this area in the future .
new and improved equipment for chemical and biological defense is needed to overcome some shortfalls , and dod is having difficulty meeting all of its planned chemical and biological defense research goals .
only a few biological agent vaccines have been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
