these include ( 1 ) prohibitions on certain persons based on age and on criminal history ; ( 2 ) state concealed carry laws ; and ( 3 ) state and local assault weapons bans .
in 2008 , the u.s. supreme court decided district of columbia v. heller , in which the court held that the second amendment to the u.s. constitution protects an individual right to possess a firearm , unconnected with service in a militia , and the use of that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home .
shortly afterward in mcdonald v. city of chicago , the supreme court held that the second amendment also applies to the states , but it did not further explore the scope of the second amendment .
this report first discusses the standard of judicial review that the lower courts generally have fashioned to determine if a firearm law is in violation of the second amendment .
although heller did not constitute "an exhaustive historical analysis ... of the full scope of the second amendment," the court noted that its decision "does not imperil every law regulating firearms," and "[does] not cast doubt [] on longstanding regulatory measures [such] as 'prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,' 'laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.' .
since heller and mcdonald , both federal and state firearms laws have been regularly challenged under the second amendment .
next , the report examines select categories of firearms laws that have been challenged under the second amendment .
an examination of these categories could provide some insight as to how courts might assess future firearms legislation on second amendment grounds .
these include , among others , measures that would ban certain assault weapons and prohibit possession of large capacity magazines ( e.g. , s. 150 / h.r .
in the 113 th congress , several gun control proposals have been introduced .
437 / s. 33 ) ; and measures that would require background checks on private transfers of firearms or ammunition ( e.g. , s. 22 / s. 174 / s. 374 / h.r .
141 ) .
therefore , with respect to concealed carry laws , courts have been confronted with determining whether the second amendment's protections extend beyond the home and , if so , whether concealed carry laws substantially burden the right of self - defense .
the individuals targeted by this provision include ( 1 ) persons convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year ; ( 2 ) fugitives from justice ; ( 3 ) individuals who are unlawful users or addicts of any controlled substance ; ( 4 ) persons legally determined to be mentally defective , or who have been committed to a mental institution ; ( 5 ) aliens illegally or unlawfully in the united states , as well as those who have been admitted pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa ; ( 6 ) individuals who have been discharged dishonorably from the armed forces ; ( 7 ) persons who have renounced united states citizenship ; ( 8 ) individuals subject to a pertinent court order ; and , finally , ( 9 ) persons who have been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense .
