in addition to the december 6 testimony , in several prior hearings , we testified that significant control weaknesses in the federal emergency management agency's ( fema ) individuals and households program ( ihp ) and in the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) purchase card program left the government vulnerable to significant fraud , waste , and abuse .
specifically , the testimony addressed our findings related to potentially improper and / or fraudulent ( 1 ) rental assistance payments fema made to registrants at the same time it was providing free housing via trailers and apartments ; ( 2 ) duplicate assistance payments to individuals who claimed damages to the same property for both hurricanes katrina and rita ; and ( 3 ) ihp payments to nonqualified aliens who did not qualify for ihp .
in early october 2006 , fema reported to congress that it had delivered approximately $7 billion in ihp aid for hurricanes katrina and rita .
the testimony also discussed ( 1 ) the importance of fraud prevention , and ( 2 ) the results of our investigation into property bought by fema using dhs purchase cards , which was subsequently lost or stolen .
on december 6 , 2006 , we testified before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs on the continued findings of fraud , waste , and abuse associated with disaster relief for hurricanes katrina and rita .
the stafford act allowed registrants to receive financial assistance up to a cap of $26,200 for disasters occurring in 2005 .
ihp is a major component of the federal disaster response efforts designed to provide financial assistance to individuals and households that have , as a direct result of a major disaster , necessary expenses and serious needs that cannot be met through other means .
this ihp amount included expedited assistance , temporary housing assistance , repair and replacement of real and personal property , and other miscellaneous categories .
as we previously reported , the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( stafford act ) provides the basis for ihp .
for purposes of the testimony , potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments referred to payments made by fema based on potentially improper and / or fraudulent registration data submitted by ihp registrants .
our december 6 , 2006 , testimony detailed our findings related to additional work we had performed since june 2006 .
fema and dhs had fully concurred with 19 recommendations , and substantially or partially concurred with the remaining 6 recommendations .
this report summarizes the findings detailed in our december 6 , 2006 , testimony and makes specific recommendations for corrective action .
fema stated that in the 15 months since hurricane katrina , fema has made great strides in correcting its deficiencies .
in contrast , as of november 2006 , fema had detected through its own processes about $290 million in overpayments .
collection of only $7 million of an estimated $1 billion of fraudulent and improper payments clearly supports the basic point we have previously made that fraud prevention is far more efficient and effective than detection and collection .
fema believes that the stringent controls it instituted this past year improve its safeguards and will help eliminate processing errors and fraudulent abuse .
