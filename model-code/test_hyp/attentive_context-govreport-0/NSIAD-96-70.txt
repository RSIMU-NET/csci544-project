we reviewed the air force's and the navy's policies and procedures for determining requirements and budgets for aviation spare parts .
our objective was to determine whether the air force's and the navy's requirements and budgets reflect the actual amounts needed .
the following are gao's comments on the department of defense's ( dod ) letter dated february 13 , 1996 .
the congress has made several attempts to change the air force's policy .
although air force and navy policies and procedures related to reserving on - hand assets for depot maintenance requirements differ , both agencies' policies and procedures result in overstated requirements .
this overstatement occurred because of questionable air force and navy policies concerning the determination of requirements and the accountability for assets held in reserve to satisfy depot maintenance needs .
this reflects a reduction in the navy's assets from at least $154 million to at least $60 million .
the air force and the navy budget and spend billions annually to procure and repair aviation spare parts .
despite these efforts , the air force continues its policy of not considering depot supply level assets in requirements and budget computations .
for fiscal year 1996 , the air force budgeted $3.9 billion to procure and repair aviation spare parts .
we have decreased the amount of assets reserved for depot maintenance needs from $226 million to $132 million .
since 1984 , air force policy has been to reserve on - hand consumable parts for depot maintenance needs and not to use these assets to offset computed requirements when deciding to buy or projecting annual budgeted buys .
dod did not agree that current air force and navy procedures related to reserving on - hand assets for depot maintenance resulted in overstated requirements .
for example , for fiscal year 1997 , the navy budgeted $1.4 billion for this purpose .
if these assets had been applied to offset requirements , this procurement would not have been necessary .
these inaccuracies included unsupported or incorrect ( 1 ) maintenance replacement rates , ( 2 ) demand rates , ( 3 ) planned program requirements , ( 4 ) repair costs , and ( 5 ) lead times .
some of the demands to satisfy depot maintenance needs are included once as recurring demands based on past usage and again as nonrecurring demands to meet planned program requirements .
nevertheless , dod's and the air force's position is that depot supply level assets are set aside for depot maintenance and , therefore , are not considered to offset wholesale requirements .
the inaccuracies caused buys and repairs to be understated by about $8 million on some items and overstated by about $15 million on others .
as a result , the congress reduced the air force's operation and maintenance budget for fiscal year 1994 .
dod agreed that action should be taken to improve the accuracy of requirement determination processes and stated that the air force and the navy are taking such actions ( see app .
as a result , budget requirements were overstated by $1.1 million .
our review of overall budget inventory data related to these assets and our sampling tests of f - 100 and f - 404 engine parts showed that the air force and the navy overstated budgeted buys and repairs by about $132 million .
