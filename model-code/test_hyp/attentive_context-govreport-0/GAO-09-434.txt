these challenges include ( 1 ) improving agencywide management , ( 2 ) transforming epa's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals , ( 3 ) improving implementation of the clean air act , ( 4 ) reducing pollution in the nation's waters , ( 5 ) speeding the pace of cleanup at superfund and other hazardous waste sites , and ( 6 ) addressing emerging climate change issues .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) operates in a highly complex and controversial regulatory arena , and its policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy , society , and government .
epa's overarching mission is to protect human health and the environment by implementing and enforcing environmental laws intended to improve the quality of our air and water and to protect our land .
epa will also receive an additional $7.2 billion in stimulus funding from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 , primarily for water infrastructure projects and superfund .
in these reports , gao has made a number of recommendations intended to improve epa's programs by enhancing the information it uses to manage its programs and strengthening internal controls .
 ( see related gao products at the end of this report ) .
epa's 2009 budget included about $939 million for clean air and climate change , $2.6 billion for clean water , and $1.7 billion for land restoration .
as you know , epa's responsibilities are carried out under a complex set of environmental laws , such as the clean air act and the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) .
epa has generally concurred with our recommendations , but has been slow to implement some of them .
the agency's budget has been declining in recent years from $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $7.1 billion requested for fiscal year 2009 – – a decline of about 28 percent in real terms .
the just - released president's fiscal year 2010 budget request includes $ 10.5 billion for epa .
epa also implements regulations to benefit public health and the environment while balancing , as appropriate , the cost to industry and others — a particularly controversial issue — and implements laws , such as the clean air act , while complying with numerous court orders resulting from the myriad lawsuits brought against the agency by states , concerned citizens , special interest groups , and others .
the emergence of issues such as stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change suggest that the agency's responsibilities will continue to grow .
considering epa's evolving roles and responsibilities , we were asked to identify the major management challenges and program risks that epa faces as it works to accomplish its mission of protecting human health and the environment .
furthermore , enforcement activities primarily occur in epa's 10 regions , which possess considerable autonomy – – causing significant variations in enforcement activities from region to region .
the agency is composed of major offices aligned with environmental laws and 10 regional offices .
charged initially with cleaning up pollution of the environment , epa's tasks have become increasingly complicated as we understand more about the dangers and pervasiveness of toxic substances .
