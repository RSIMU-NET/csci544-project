in addition , an evaluation of the difficulties of implementing the chosen fee would need to be conducted in order to understand the consequences for the agencies' programs and expenditures and to deal fairly with such issues as preference and permit value .
we provided information on the ( 1 ) extent of livestock grazing on , and program purposes for , land managed by 10 federal agencies ; ( 2 ) amount spent in fiscal year 2004 by these agencies and other federal agencies that have grazing - related activities , to manage livestock grazing on public lands ; ( 3 ) total receipts collected for grazing privileges by the 10 federal agencies with grazing programs and the amounts disbursed to counties , states , or the federal government ; and ( 4 ) grazing fees charged by the 10 federal agencies , western states , and private ranchers , and the reasons for any differences among the fees .
however , interior stated that the report did not sufficiently discuss significant indirect benefits from grazing to other blm programs that are difficult to quantify .
dod did not provide official written comments , but the air force and army provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
but any change in the current fee may necessitate that congress reconsider the purpose of the fee and policy trade - offs of different fees .
in this context , you asked us to determine for 2004 the ( 1 ) extent of grazing on , and program purposes for , lands managed by the 10 federal agencies in the fiscal year ; ( 2 ) amount spent in the fiscal year by these agencies , and other federal agencies that have grazing - related activities , to manage livestock grazing on public lands ; ( 3 ) total receipts collected during the fiscal year for grazing privileges by the 10 federal agencies with grazing programs , and the amounts disbursed to counties , states , or the federal government ; and ( 4 ) fees charged by the 10 federal agencies , western states , and private ranchers , and the reasons for any differences among the fees .
although other federal agencies' grazing programs are much smaller than blm's and the forest service's , they demonstrate the application of competitive and market - based approaches to charging user fees for grazing programs and recovering some program expenditures .
since the early 1900s , the federal government has required ranchers to pay a fee for grazing their livestock on millions of acres of federal land located primarily in western states .
depending on the approach taken to set and implement a grazing fee for lands managed by blm and the forest service , the federal government could close the gap that exists between those programs' grazing expenditures and receipts .
however , faced with a growing and unsustainable fiscal imbalance , the government cannot accept all of its existing programs , policies , and activities as “givens.” now , as in the 1990s , tightened federal budgets and a persistent federal deficit create the need to examine federal programs that spend more funds than they generate in receipts and to determine whether the purposes of these programs warrant increasing user fees .
