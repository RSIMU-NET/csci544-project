the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is responsible for securing the nation's transportation systems while facilitating the movement of passengers and commerce using security - related technologies .
this report addresses ( 1 ) the extent and purposes of tsa's use of otas and ( 2 ) how tsa ensures prices are reasonable and how it oversees otas .
otas entered into under this authority are generally not subject to certain federal laws and regulations related to federal contracts such as the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , allowing tsa to customize them to help meet project requirements and mission needs .
in addition to the steps tsa has taken to improve ota oversight , such as revising its ota policy and increasing training requirements , tsa officials told us that they will continue to conduct quarterly compliance reviews and monthly data verification in accordance with their policy .
as one of the largest components of the department of homeland security , tsa obligated more than $1.4 billion through instruments called other transaction agreements ( ota ) from fiscal years 2012 to 2016 .
in response to these deficiencies , tsa has taken action to strengthen oversight and compliance with its policy .
to fulfill this mission , tsa must ensure that all airline passengers and their carry - on and checked baggage are screened to deter , detect , and prevent the carriage of prohibited and other dangerous items , such as explosives , on board commercial aircraft .
congress granted tsa other transaction authority in 2001 , allowing it to enter into agreements other than standard government contracts or other traditional mechanisms .
to address the extent to which tsa uses otas , we analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) on obligations through contracts and otas from fiscal year 2012 to 2016 .
as we and others have previously reported , the use of otas provides flexibility but carries the risk of reduced accountability and transparency , in part because such agreements are exempt from the far and the related controls and oversight mechanisms that apply to contracts .
in addition , tsa has continued to include otas in its quarterly compliance review process .
starting in fiscal year 2015 , four years after it issued its 2011 ota policy , tsa began to include otas in its contract compliance review program .
in addition , tsa also recently increased oversight of the cor program to support efficient ota and contract oversight and administration .
you asked us to review tsa's use of otas .
officials noted that their efforts to increase training , oversight , and enforcement of ota policies and procedures have resulted in increased awareness of reporting requirements and greater compliance .
nonetheless , tsa's own 2015 internal compliance review found significant gaps in ota documentation and reporting .
compliance reviews are conducted quarterly based on a selection of contracts and otas awarded in the previous quarter and intended to improve contracting operations , ensure compliance with applicable standards and policies , and identify best practices .
five reimbursement programs used otas to partially or fully reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the allowable costs associated with tsa security programs .
