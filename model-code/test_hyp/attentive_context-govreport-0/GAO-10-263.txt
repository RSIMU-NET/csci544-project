we included the following programs in our review: children's health insurance program ( chip ) ; community development block grant ( cdbg ) and neighborhood education state grants , state fiscal stabilization fund ( state fiscal federal transit formula grants programs ; head start ; highway planning and construction ; individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) , part b ; medicaid ; section 8 housing choice vouchers ; temporary aid for needy families ( tanf ) ; and title i grants to local education agencies ( title i ) .
of the $580 billion in additional federal spending associated with the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) , the federal government obligated an estimated $161 billion through federal grant programs for fiscal year 2009 .
the federal government uses formula grants to determine funding amounts for many of the largest federal assistance programs .
this report responds to your request that we determine ( 1 ) how much the federal government obligates to the largest federal assistance programs based on the decennial census and related data , and how the recovery act changed that amount ; and ( 2 ) what factors could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas .
these programs provide funding for a variety of purposes , including health insurance for low income families and individuals , improvement of highway and public transportation systems , and special education programs .
to answer our objectives , we identified 11 federal assistance programs representing the 10 largest programs in each of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 based on the dollar amounts obligated reported in the president's fiscal year 2010 budget , issued in may 2009 , office of management and budget ( omb ) , analytical perspectives , budget of the united states government , fiscal year 2010 ( fiscal year 2010 budget ) .
funding for federal assistance programs continues to increase .
we considered funding to be based on census or related data if any part of the funding formula ( s ) or eligibility requirements relied on these data sources .
to determine whether the programs' funding relied on census and related data , we reviewed statutes , our prior work , the catalog of federal domestic assistance programs ( cfda ) , congressional research service reports , and agency web pages and reports related to each of the programs .
to determine what factors could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas , we reviewed our prior work ( see the list of related gao products at the end of this report ) and other research on formula grants .
in june 2009 , the census bureau reported that in fiscal year 2007 the federal government obligated over $446 billion through funding formulas that rely at least in part on census and related data .
our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) how much the federal government obligates to the largest federal assistance programs based on the decennial census and related data and how the recovery act changed that amount , and ( 2 ) what factors could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas .
more than 10 years ago , we reported that in fiscal year 1998 the federal government obligated about $162 billion through 22 of the largest federal assistance programs using formulas based at least in part on decennial census and related data .
