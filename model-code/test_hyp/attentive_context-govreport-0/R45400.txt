the impact aid program , administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) , was originally established in 1950 by p.l .
the impact aid program authorizes several types of payments: federal property ( section 7002 ) , federally connected children: basic support payments ( section 7003 ( b ) ) , payments for children with disabilities ( section 7003 ( d ) ) , construction ( section 7007 ) , and facilities maintenance ( section 7008 ) .
the most substantial program changes made through all of these vehicles have been to provisions affecting payments for federal property ( section 7002 ) and basic support payments ( section 7003 ( b ) ) .
81-874 , 15 years prior to the enactment of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) .
the impact aid provisions discussed in this report reflect changes made to the program by the essa as well as those made through the annual national defense authorization acts ( ndaas ) and annual departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies ( l - hhs - ed ) appropriations acts that have been enacted through august 2018 .
in addition to the impact aid programs administered by ed , a smaller set of programs administered by the department of defense ( dod ) are often referred to as the "dod impact aid" programs .
impact aid compensates local educational agencies ( leas ) for a "substantial and continuing financial burden" resulting from federal activities .
this is followed by information about recent appropriations for impact aid .
changes to the impact aid program made by the essa generally took effect beginning in fy2017 .
thus , impact aid is intended to compensate leas , in part , for the resulting loss of tax revenue .
in 1994 , the impact aid program was incorporated into title viii of the esea .
as part of this process , the essa also reauthorized and revised the impact aid program and moved it into title vii of the esea .
these activities include federal ownership of certain lands , as well as the enrollments in leas of children whose parents work or live on federal property and children living on indian lands .
the esea was most recently reauthorized in 2015 by the every student succeeds act ( essa ; p.l .
appropriations for the impact aid program are made through the annual l - hhs - ed appropriations act .
the federal government provides compensation because leas are unable to collect property or other taxes from these individuals ( e.g. , members of the uniformed services living on military bases ) or their employers , even though the leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children .
the report concludes with an overview of the "impact aid" programs administered by dod .
a second dod impact aid program , for leas serving military dependent children with severe disabilities , has been funded since fy2002 .
these two programs include one that provides supplemental aid to leas serving children with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services , and one that provides assistance to leas serving children with severe disabilities with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services .
