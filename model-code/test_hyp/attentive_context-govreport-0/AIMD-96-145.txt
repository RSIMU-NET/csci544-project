federal power marketing administrations ( pmas ) are part of the department of energy ( doe ) .
as requested , this report presents the results of our review of three power marketing administrations' ( pmas ) cost recovery practices , financing , and comparison to nonfederal utilities .
the objectives of this report were to determine ( 1 ) whether all power - related costs incurred through september 30 , 1995 , have been recovered through the pmas' electricity rates ( chapter 2 ) , ( 2 ) whether the financing for power - related capital projects is subsidized by the federal government and , if so , to what extent ( chapter 3 ) , and ( 3 ) how pmas differ from nonfederal utilities and the impact of these differences on power production costs ( chapter 4 ) .
the primary focus of our review was to determine whether all power - related costs incurred through september 30 , 1995 , have been recovered through the pmas' electricity rates ; whether the financing for power - related capital projects is subsidized by the federal government and , if so , to what extent ; and how pmas differ from nonfederal utilities and the impact of these differences on power production costs .
increased competition may impact the pmas' status as a low cost supplier .
some costs related to producing and marketing federal hydropower are not being recovered through power rates by the three pmas .
unlike most other federal agencies , pmas are required by law to recover through rates funds appropriated for power - related costs .
almost all of it is hydroelectric power generated by multiple - purpose dams built and operated by other federal agencies .
fourth , certain costs for environmental mitigation have been legislatively precluded from cost recovery .
several key laws have resulted in an increasingly competitive electricity market .
we identified five main power - related activities for which costs are not fully recovered .
copies will also be made available to others upon request .
in addition , we were asked to provide information on federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) oversight of the pmas .
southeastern's appropriated debt has remained relatively constant .
the five pmas sell electric power within 34 states — to all states except those in the northeast and upper midwest .
ious have adopted sfas no .
the objective , based on our agreements with congressional requester staff , was to determine whether all power - related costs incurred through september 30 , 1995 , had been recovered through electricity rates .
they sold about 3 percent of the nation's electric power output in 1994 .
pogs and ious have more direct control over capital budgets .
nationwide , there are five pmas — the three on which this report is focused , plus the alaska power administration and the bonneville power administration .
because the cost of the abandoned transmission line has not been included in rates since construction was discontinued over 26 years ago , we believe doubt exists about whether these costs will ever be included in rates .
private sector accounting standards have required similar reporting for pensions beginning in 1987 and postretirement health and other benefits beginning in 1993 .
