my statement today will identify ( 1 ) the extent to which the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has adopted market - based mechanisms for commercial uses of spectrum , ( 2 ) the extent to which market - based mechanisms have been adopted for federal government use of spectrum , ( 3 ) options for improving spectrum management , and ( 4 ) potential barriers to spectrum reform .
as you know , the radio - frequency spectrum is used to provide an array of wireless communications services that are critical to the u.s. economy and various government missions , such as national security .
demand for radio - frequency spectrum has exploded over the past several decades as new technologies and services have been — and continue to be — brought to the market in the private sector , and new mission needs unfold among government users .
congress extended fcc's auction authority to 2011 with the passage of the deficit reduction act of 2005 .
as a result , nearly all parties are becoming increasingly concerned about the availability of spectrum for future needs because most of the usable spectrum in the united states has already been allocated to existing services and users .
while some countries have adopted market - based mechanisms to encourage the efficient use of spectrum by government agencies , the department of commerce's national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) has not adopted similar mechanisms for federal government use in the united states .
the most frequently cited options include ( 1 ) extending fcc's auction authority , ( 2 ) reexamining the use and distribution of spectrum , and ( 3 ) ensuring clearly defined rights and flexibility in commercially licensed spectrum bands ; there was no consensus on these options , except for extending fcc's auction authority .
the current management framework may pose barriers to reform since , while two agencies have been given responsibility for aspects of spectrum management , neither has been given ultimate decision - making authority over all spectrum use or the authority to impose fundamental reform , such as increasing the reliance on market - based mechanisms .
many parties believe that spectrum management reform — such as greater reliance on market - based mechanisms that invoke the forces of demand and supply — is essential to meeting the growing and unpredictable demand for spectrum .
to address these barriers , we have previously recommended that ( 1 ) the secretary of commerce and fcc establish and carry out formal , joint planning activities to develop a national spectrum plan to guide decision making ; and ( 2 ) the relevant administrative agencies and congressional committees work together to develop and implement a plan for the establishment of a commission that would conduct a comprehensive examination of current spectrum management .
examples of market - based mechanisms include introducing flexibility in the use of spectrum , using auctions to assign licenses , and enhancing the use of secondary markets as a means for companies to obtain access to spectrum .
we appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony on spectrum reform issues .
given the success of fcc's use of auctions and the overwhelming support for extending fcc's auction authority , we suggested that the congress consider extending fcc's auction authority beyond the 2007 expiration date .
