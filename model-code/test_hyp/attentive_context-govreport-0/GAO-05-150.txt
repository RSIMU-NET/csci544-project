many developing countries have expressed concern about their inability to take advantage of global trading opportunities because they lack the capacity to participate in international trade .
in 2002 , the president's trade policy agenda pledged the united states would provide tools and training to countries needing help to benefit from the global trading system .
in 2001 , the least - developed countries called for technical assistance to strengthen their institutions and trade - related infrastructure , and the world trade organization doha ministerial declaration stated that technical cooperation and capacity building were important and should be used to help countries benefit from the multilateral trading system .
as a result , u.s. government agencies have provided trade capacity building assistance through a variety of programs to help these countries .
the united states considers the ability to participate in and benefit from the global trading system key factors in reducing poverty , achieving economic growth , raising income levels , and promoting stability .
we assessed the u.s. government trade capacity building database , which reflects annual governmentwide surveys initiated in 2001 about u.s. trade capacity building activities and is administered by the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) .
the administrator , u.s. agency for international development , should direct the agency to set milestones for completing its efforts to develop trade capacity building performance indicators to be used by ( 1 ) its field missions to monitor and measure the results of their trade capacity building efforts and ( 2 ) its relevant agency bureaus to conduct periodic program evaluations .
the u.s. agency for international development should share its findings with other agencies that fund and implement trade capacity building assistance .
we focused our review on the six u.s. agencies funding and implementing 96 percent of the trade capacity building assistance , concentrating primarily on usaid , because it provided the bulk of the funding , as well as the office of the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) .
ways to increase trade opportunities include strengthening economic policies ; removing trade barriers ; and building well - functioning economic , political , and legal institutions .
we conducted fieldwork in el salvador , ghana , and egypt , choosing these countries because they were among the 20 countries receiving the most trade capacity building funding , and they represented different regions and income levels ( low and middle income ) .
this warrants a comprehensive , coordinated approach to its delivery , based on solid evidence of its effectiveness in generating economic development and growth through trade .
in addition , without evaluations identifying what trade capacity building activities are effective , the agencies will have difficulty determining whether their efforts are achieving their overall trade capacity building goals .
