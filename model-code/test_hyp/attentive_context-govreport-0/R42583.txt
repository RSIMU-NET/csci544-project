wia includes titles that authorize programs for job training and related services for adults , youth , and dislocated workers ( title i ) ; adult education and literacy ( title ii ) ; employment services ( title iii ) ; and vocational rehabilitation ( title iv ) .
the workforce investment act of 1998 ( p.l .
105-220 ) is the most recent federal law to provide job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals , including youth .
since the 1930s , federal job training and employment programs and policies have sought to connect vulnerable youth to work and school .

generally , these young people have been defined as being vulnerable because they are low - income and have a barrier to employment , such as having dropped out of school or spent time in foster care .

all youth job training programs and related services are authorized under title i of wia and are carried out by the department of labor ( dol ) .
in the 112 th congress , policy makers had signaled that the law may be reauthorized in the near future .
wia authorized funding through september 30 , 2003 ; however , wia programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts .
these programs include the wia youth activities ( youth ) formula program , job corps , and youthbuild .
under the pilot and demonstration authority in title i , dol has carried out the reintegration of ex - offenders program .
although the programs have distinct activities and purposes , each program seeks to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities , as well as leadership development and community service activities .
this report provides an overview of issues pertinent to the wia youth programs , particularly youth activities and job corps .
issues that have been raised as part of the wia reauthorization process in congress and elsewhere generally include the following: some policy makers have proposed consolidating workforce programs for adults , dislocated workers , and youth .
the senate help committee held a markup of s. 1356 on july 31 , 2013 , and ordered the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3 .
together , these programs make up the federal job training system for youth .
during the 111 th congress , the senate health , education , labor , and pensions ( help ) committee held a series of listening sessions in april 2009 to address the positive aspects of wia and to increase understanding of the issues that can be addressed as part of any reauthorization legislation .
under such a proposal , states would generally have greater ability to target funds to certain activities and populations .
another issue is the perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems that serve youth , such as the education system .
