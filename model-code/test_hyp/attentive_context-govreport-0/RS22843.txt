medicaid is a means - tested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as long - term services and supports .
each state designs and administers its own version of medicaid under broad federal rules , and medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states .
participation in medicaid is voluntary for states , though all states , the district of columbia , and five territories choose to participate .
the federal government's share of a state's expenditures for most medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) .
states incur medicaid costs by making payments to service providers ( e.g. , for beneficiaries' doctor visits ) and performing administrative activities ( e.g. , making eligibility determinations ) , and the federal government reimburses states for a share of these costs .
states also use provider tax revenue to fund other medicaid or non - medicaid purposes .
the report explains how states use provider taxes to help finance medicaid and provides information regarding the extent to which states currently use such taxes .
this financing strategy allows states to fund increases to medicaid payment rates without the use of state funds because the increased medicaid payment rates are funded with provider tax revenue and federal medicaid matching funds .
in state fiscal year ( sfy ) 2014 , states reported that about 74% of the state share of medicaid costs was financed by state general funds ( most of which are raised from personal income , sales , and corporate income taxes ) .
the remaining 26% was financed by other funds ( including local government funds , provider taxes , fees , donations , assessments , and tobacco settlement funds ) .
federal statute and regulations define a provider tax as a health care - related fee , assessment , or other mandatory payment for which at least 85% of the burden of the tax revenue falls on health care providers .
at least 40% of each state's share of medicaid expenditures must be financed by the state , and up to 60% of the state's share may come from local governments .
currently , many states use provider taxes to finance a portion of their state share of medicaid expenditures .
in order for states to be able to draw down federal medicaid matching funds , the provider tax must be both broad - based ( i.e. , imposed on all providers within a specified class of providers ) and uniform ( i.e. , the same tax for all providers within a specified class of providers ) .
the report ends with a discussion of the provider tax provisions in past and present proposals that would impact medicaid provider taxes .
many of these states use the provider tax revenue to increase medicaid payment rates for the class of providers , such as hospitals , responsible for paying the provider tax .
this report provides background regarding states' use of provider taxes in the 1980s and describes the relevant federal statutes and regulations , which were mostly established in the early 1990s .
states are not allowed to hold the providers harmless for the cost of the provider tax ( i.e. , they cannot guarantee that providers receive their money back ) .
