 ( recommendation 1 ) .
the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) is one of the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) most complex projects and top priorities .
for this report , we assessed ( 1 ) the considerations that nasa took into account when updating the jwst project's cost and schedule commitments , ( 2 ) the technical and integration challenges , if any , that are affecting the execution of the jwst project , and ( 3 ) the extent to which nasa has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of the jwst project .
in june 2018 , nasa approved new cost and schedule commitments for jwst with a cost of $9.7 billion and a launch readiness date of march 2021 .
between now and its system integration review planned for august 2019 , the jwst program will have to continue to address technical challenges and mitigate risks .
112-284 included a provision for gao to assess the jwst program annually and to report to the committees on appropriations on key issues relating to program and risk management , achievement of cost and schedule goals , program technical status , and oversight mechanisms .
the project has experienced significant cost and schedule growth in recent years due to problems discovered during integration and testing .
we are making the following recommendation to nasa: the nasa administrator should direct the jwst project office to conduct a jcl prior to its system integration review .
the innovative technologies within the telescope , as well as the sheer size of some of its components — such as the tennis - court - sized sunshield — illustrate some of the immense development challenges .
we discussed these changes and the implementation of related irb recommendations with goddard space flight center and nasa headquarters project officials ; northrop grumman and space telescope science institute contractor officials ; irb members ; and defense contract management agency officials who are responsible for providing oversight of software and quality assurance processes at the northrop grumman facility on behalf of nasa .
since then , the project made progress by completing two of five phases of integration and test , but has also experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays .
conducting a jcl would better inform decision makers on the status of the project as they determine whether the project can complete remaining project development with acceptable risk and within its cost and schedule constraints .
given the project is now on its third iteration of cost and schedule commitments , conducting a jcl is a small step that nasa can take to demonstrate it is on track to meet these new commitments .
this represents a total of 95 percent of cost growth and 81 months of schedule delays since the project's cost and schedule baselines were first established in 2009 .
congress must authorize continuation of the jwst program if formulation and development costs increase over the $8 billion cost cap .
finally , to assess the extent to which nasa has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of the jwst project , we reviewed documentation on changes that nasa made to contractor oversight and project oversight activities between april and november 2018 .
