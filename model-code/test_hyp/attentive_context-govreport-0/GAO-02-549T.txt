in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , for instance , about one - quarter of the $40 billion emergency response fund was dedicated to homeland security , including funds to enhance state and local government preparedness .
the choice and design of policy tools , such as grants , regulations , and partnerships , can enhance the government's capacity to ( 1 ) target areas of highest risk to better ensure that scarce federal resources address the most pressing needs , ( 2 ) promote shared responsibilities by all parties , and ( 3 ) track and assess progress toward achieving national goals .
the congress has long recognized the need to objectively assess the results of federal programs .
the establishment of goals and performance measures to guide the nation's preparedness efforts .
over 40 federal entities have roles in combating terrorism , and past federal efforts have resulted in a lack of accountability , a lack of a cohesive effort , and duplication of programs .
for its part , the federal government historically has principally provided leadership , training , and funding assistance .
my comments today are based on a body of gao's work on terrorism and emergency preparedness and policy options for the design of federal assistance , as well as on our review of many other studies .
i appreciate the opportunity to be here in los angeles to discuss issues critical to successful federal leadership of , assistance to , and partnerships with state and local governments in the area of preparedness for terrorist events .
because the national security threat is diffuse and the challenge is highly intergovernmental , national policymakers must formulate strategies with a firm understanding of the interests , capacity , and challenges facing those governments in addressing these issues .
given the recent and proposed increases in preparedness funding as well as the need for real and meaningful improvements in preparedness , establishing clear goals and performance measures is critical to ensuring both a successful and a fiscally responsible effort .
we recognize that the president , in his proposed 2003 budget , has announced that the office of homeland security will propose such a plan later this year .
our previous work has found fragmentation and overlap among federal assistance programs .
as state and local officials have noted , this situation has led to confusion , making it difficult to identify available federal preparedness resources and effectively partner with the federal government .
in addition , we draw on ongoing work for this subcommittee ; pursuant to your request we have begun a review to examine the preparedness issues confronting state and local governments in a series of case studies .
but the initial responsibility falls upon local governments and their organizations — such as police , fire departments , emergency medical personnel , and public health agencies — which will almost invariably be the first responders to such an occurrence .
for the nation's preparedness programs , however , outcomes of where the nation should be in terms of domestic preparedness have yet to be defined .
we will examine the state and local perspective on these issues and thereby help the congress and the executive branch to better design and target programs and strategies .
