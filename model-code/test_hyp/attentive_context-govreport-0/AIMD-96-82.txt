the congress passed section 8137 ( and its successor , section 8102 of public law 104-61 , department of defense appropriations act , 1996 ) to help ensure that dod prematch , or prevalidate , disbursements with recorded obligations , which is an important control for ensuring that agency funds are used as authorized by the congress and the department .
in reducing these risks , the provisions of the act aim to strengthen accountability over dod's disbursement process , which has been plagued by long - standing problems .
this report responds to your requests that we assess the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to reduce problem disbursements and its implementation of section 8137 of public law 103-335 , department of defense appropriations act , 1995 , which required that each disbursement exceeding $5 million be matched to the appropriate obligations in dod's official accounting records before the disbursement is made .
without such matching , there is a substantial risk that ( 1 ) fraudulent or erroneous payments may be made without being detected and ( 2 ) cumulative amounts of disbursements may exceed appropriated amounts and other legal limits .
this review was conducted jointly with defense's office of inspector general ( ig ) , and the ig has issued a separate report on dod's implementation of the prevalidation program .
these included correcting system weaknesses , providing additional training to accounting and disbursing personnel working in the prevalidation program , and developing useful performance indicators for monitoring the progress of the program .
dod's problems with accounting for and reporting on disbursements will not be resolved until ( 1 ) weaknesses in control procedures that allow problem disbursements to occur are corrected and ( 2 ) improvements are made to dod's contract pay , disbursing , and accounting processes and systems .
the ig recommended a number of specific actions to improve the prevalidation program .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess dod's progress in reducing problem disbursements and ( 2 ) review dod's implementation of the requirements in section 8137 of public law 103-335 and section 8102 of public law 104-61 , for dod to match disbursements over $5 million with obligations in the official accounting records prior to making payments .
we agree with the recommendations contained in the ig's report , and , likewise , the ig agrees with the recommendations contained in this report .
we ( 1 ) analyzed various dod reports on problem disbursements to identify and document any changes in problem disbursement balances , ( 2 ) spoke with dfas officials to identify systemic problems hindering dod's ability to reduce problem disbursement balances , and ( 3 ) reviewed internal dod audit reports and the secretary of defense's fiscal year 1995 annual statement of assurance under the federal manager's financial integrity act .
prevalidating all disbursements is important , especially in the short term , to protect the integrity of dod's disbursement process while long - term improvements are made to dod's contract pay , disbursing , and accounting processes and systems .
it also required ( 1 ) dod to develop and submit an implementation plan to the congress and ( 2 ) the dod inspector general to review the plan and submit an independent assessment to the congressional defense committees .
