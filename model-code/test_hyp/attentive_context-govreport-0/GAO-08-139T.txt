my testimony today will focus on: ( 1 ) the progress tsa and other dhs components have made in securing the nation's commercial aviation system and ( 2 ) challenges that have impeded dhs's ( and , as they relate to transportation security , tsa ) efforts to implement its mission and management functions .
the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , originally established as an agency within the department of transportation in 2001 but now a component within dhs , is charged with securing the transportation network while also ensuring the free movement of people and commerce .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) progress and challenges in securing our nation's aviation system .
tsa has primary responsibility for security in all modes of transportation and since its inception has developed and implemented a variety of programs and procedures to secure the commercial aviation system .
my comments are based on issued gao reports and testimonies addressing the security of the nation's aviation system , including an august 2007 report that highlights the progress dhs has made in implementing its mission and management functions .
other dhs components , federal agencies , state and local governments , and the private sector also play a role in aviation security .
these issues include: ( 1 ) transforming and integrating dhs's management functions ; ( 2 ) establishing baseline performance goals and measures and engaging in effective strategic planning efforts ; ( 3 ) applying and strengthening a risk management approach for implementing missions and making resource allocation decisions ; ( 4 ) sharing information with key stakeholders ; and ( 5 ) coordinating and partnering with federal , state and local , and private sector agencies .
for example , the u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) has responsibility for conducting passenger prescreening — in general , the matching of passenger information against terrorist watch lists prior to an aircraft's departure — for international flights operating to or from the united states , as well as inspecting inbound air cargo upon its arrival in the united states .
in this report , we reviewed the extent to which dhs has taken actions to achieve performance expectations in each of its mission and management areas that we identified from legislation , homeland security presidential directives , and dhs strategic planning documents .
in determining the department's overall level of progress in achieving performance expectations in each of its mission and management areas , we concluded whether the department had made limited , modest , moderate , or substantial progress .
in accordance with tsa requirements , airport authorities are responsible for implementing measures to secure access to restricted airport areas as well as airport perimeters , while air carriers are responsible for inspecting air cargo , among other things .
these assessments of progress do not reflect , nor are they intended to reflect , the extent to which actions by dhs and its components have made the nation more secure .
based primarily on our past work , we made a determination regarding whether dhs generally achieved or generally did not achieve the key elements of each performance expectation .
