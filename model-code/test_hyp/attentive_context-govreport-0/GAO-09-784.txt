since the early 1970s , much of the federal government's share of new capital investment in mass transportation has come through the federal transit administration's ( fta ) new starts program .
over the last decade , the new starts program has provided state and local agencies with over $10 billion to help design and construct transit projects nationwide .
through this program , fta identifies and recommends new fixed - guideway transit projects for grants , typically through full funding grant agreements ( ffga ) .
this report discusses the ( 1 ) time it has generally taken for proposed projects to move through the new starts process , and what congress and fta have done to expedite the process , and ( 2 ) options that exist to expedite the process .
the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea - lu ) , which authorized the new starts program through fiscal year 2009 , identifies criteria for how fta evaluates and rates projects .
we selected these projects based on a range of characteristics , including: ( 1 ) timing ( i.e. , when projects received a ffga ) ; ( 2 ) mode ( i.e. , heavy rail , light rail , or bus ) ; ( 3 ) scope ( i.e. , the total cost of the project ) ; and ( 4 ) geographic area .
fta must prioritize projects for funding by evaluating , rating , and recommending potential projects on the basis of specific financial commitment and project justification criteria — including mobility improvements , cost - effectiveness , economic development effects , land use , environmental benefits , and operating efficiencies .
these issues and the upcoming reauthorization of all surface transportation programs , including the new starts program , have led stakeholders and policymakers to examine the existing evaluation and rating process and consider potential modifications and other options to reduce the complexity , cost , and time it takes for a new starts project to go through the pipeline .
we have previously identified fta's use of a rigorous and systematic evaluation process to distinguish among proposed new starts investments as a model for other transportation programs .
we are required by safetea - lu to report each year on fta's processes and procedures for evaluating , rating , and recommending new starts projects for federal funding and on fta's implementation of these processes and procedures .
analyze the streamlining options identified in this report , along with any additional options , to determine which options , if any , to implement — seeking legislative change if necessary — to expedite the project development within the new starts program .
however , we and other stakeholders and policymakers have also identified challenges facing the new starts program .
while fta has taken some steps to improve its data collection and retention , additional work is needed .
the federal transit administration evaluated and rated 14 new starts projects in preliminary engineering and final design during the fiscal year 2010 cycle .
moreover , this lack of adequate data makes it difficult for congress and fta to assess the extent to which federal efforts designed to expedite the new starts process are succeeding .
