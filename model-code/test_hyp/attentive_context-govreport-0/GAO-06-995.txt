for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been urged by commissions , panels , and legislation to make increased use of commercial acquisitions to take advantage of the efficiencies of the commercial marketplace .
specifically , we determined ( 1 ) the extent to which the air force has increased its use of commercial acquisition to obtain expected benefits and ( 2 ) the risks associated with air force use of commercial acquisition .
to help ensure the increased use of commercial acquisition , the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) established and the air force implemented two commercial acquisition goals to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2005 .
these were to double the dollar value of commercial acquisition contract actions awarded in 1999 ( for the air force this meant going from about $3 billion to about $6 billion ) and strive to increase the number of commercial contract actions awarded to 50 percent of all air force contract actions .
in setting these goals , osd expected that the increased use of commercial acquisition would provide dod with greater access to commercial markets ( products and service types ) with increased competition , better prices , and new market entrants and / or technologies .
dod partially agreed with our recommendation to measure the benefits expected from commercial acquisition by collecting information to evaluate the extent of cost savings , increased access to commercial markets , and greater access to nontraditional contractors .
we reviewed the files associated with these contracts at air force materiel command ( afmc ) locations including ( 1 ) wright - patterson air force base , ohio ; ( 2 ) tinker air force base , oklahoma ; ( 3 ) robins air force base , georgia ; and ( 4 ) hanscom air force base , massachusetts .
we encourage such efforts , and would expect that if dod collects information on nontraditional contractors it reaches using commercial acquisition and it is still unable to evaluate whether significant benefits exist from using commercial acquisition , dod will recognize the need to collect additional information .
as its overall spending has increased , the air force has increased spending using commercial acquisition , from $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2001 to over $8 billion in fiscal year 2005 ( see fig .
we also reviewed all air force contracts awarded in fiscal year 2004 for products over $5 million using commercial acquisition .
however , in the cases where it is necessary to award sole - source , the secretary should collect the information necessary to evaluate the benefit ( s ) of awarding commercial verses a noncommercial contract .
you asked us to examine the air force's efforts to meet these goals and identify any associated risks in commercial acquisition practices .
to conduct our work , we collected and reviewed information on air force use of commercial acquisition from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005 .
we believe dod is taking the first step necessary to evaluate whether it has benefited from the increased use of commercial acquisition .
to help ensure that the air force is able to measure the benefits expected from commercial acquisition , we recommend collecting information that would allow evaluating the extent of cost savings , increased access to commercial markets , and greater access to nontraditional contractors .
