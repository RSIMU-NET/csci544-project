in june 2007 , exxonmobil corporation and conocophillips , two of the largest u.s. oil companies , abandoned their multi - billion dollar investments in the heavy oil deposits of the orinoco basin in venezuela .
this action followed the breakdown of negotiations between the companies and the government of president hugo chavez and petroleos de venezuela ( pdv ) , the venezuelan national oil company .
this report assesses the position of national oil companies , and how their evolving strength may affect the availability of supply in the oil market , and hence , oil security .
this amounted to approximately 10% of the company's total reserve holdings , and its production from venezuela amounted to 4% of its total crude oil production .
venezuela , traditionally , has a large share of crude oil imports into the united states .
four other international oil companies , including total sa from france , statoil from norway , bp from great britain , and chevron from the united states , accepted agreements that raised the pdv share in their orinoco projects from approximately 40% to a controlling interest of about 78% .
on the venezuelan side , pdv expanded its reserve and production position , and its strength in the international oil market .
this oil flow is now more directly under the control of the venezuelan government which may or may not allow the flow of crude oil to follow economic market forces .
the company was seen as less likely to be able to meet its reserve replacement targets and the price of its shares fell on the stock market .
although conocophillips continues to negotiate compensation for its holdings , the company took a $4.5 billion dollar write - off against second - quarter 2007 earnings .
the report also examines the effects of national oil company expansion on the major private international oil companies as well as how these companies might differ in motivation and results .
policy options to deal with the rise of national oil companies by the countries without them are also evaluated .
conocophillips , especially , was adversely affected by the decision .
conocophillips recorded 1.1 billion barrels of proved reserves from its venezuelan ventures .
if current production declines in the face of growing world demand , it is likely that prices will rise , and the possibility of physical shortages will be heightened .
in the oil industry , based as it is on current production to generate current earnings and on reserve positions to ensure the future viability of the enterprise , several standards need to be applied to assess the evolving nature of the companies in the industry .
as nations establish their own national oil companies , territories open for exploration and development by private companies may diminish .
it is also not likely that the reserve positions of the companies will change in favor of the international oil companies in the future .
if exploration and development expenditures are reduced because of problems encountered by some firms in accessing international capital markets , the relative scarcity of oil might increase , leading to higher future prices , as well as potentially restricted supply .
these five firms hold only 3.8% of world liquid reserves , and their major holdings are in the united states and canada .
