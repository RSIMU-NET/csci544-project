the department of defense ( dod ) depends on small businesses to support its missions , spark innovation , and develop technologies to support the warfighter .
this report addresses the extent to which dod osbp has integrated cybersecurity into its existing outreach and education efforts for defense small businesses .
to better position defense small businesses in protecting information and networks from cyber threats , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the director of the dod osbp , as part of its existing outreach efforts , to identify and disseminate cybersecurity resources to defense small businesses .
we focused our review on the department of defense ( dod ) office of small business programs ( osbp ) because this office is responsible for providing small business policy advice to the office of the secretary of defense and for providing policy oversight to dod military department and dod component small business offices , per dod directive 4205.01 .
the defense security service also reported in 2012 that our national security relies on success in thwarting persistent attacks — including cyber attacks — that target u.s. technology , intellectual property , trade secrets and proprietary information .
by leveraging resources that dod components and other federal agencies have already developed , some of which have been identified in this report , dod osbp will be able to spend more time focusing on other priorities such as developing the training curriculum .
dod concurred with our recommendation that the secretary of defense direct the director of the dod osbp , as part of its existing outreach efforts , to identify and disseminate cybersecurity resources to defense small businesses .
we also discussed with dod osbp officials any challenges or limitations to their ability to conduct cybersecurity outreach and education .
dod stated that understanding the essential need to protect dod critical networks , information and infrastructure — including those within defense small businesses — dod osbp , with support from the dod chief information officer , is expanding its current cybersecurity awareness and outreach programs .
in technical comments on the report , the federal communications commission identified the following additional federal cybersecurity resource — the communications security , reliability and interoperability council - cybersecurity risk management and best practices working group 4: final report .
in february 2015 , the director of national intelligence reported that cyber threats to u.s. national and economic security are increasing in frequency , scale , sophistication , and severity of impact .
dod maintains an office of small business programs ( osbp ) to ensure that small businesses receive a fair proportion of dod purchases , contracts , and subcontracts for property and services .
by identifying and disseminating information about existing cybersecurity resources to defense small businesses , these businesses may be made more aware of cybersecurity practices and cyber threats , thereby potentially assisting them in protecting their networks against cyber exploits .
we provided a draft of this report to dod , the federal communications commission , the department of homeland security , the department of justice , the u.s. small business administration , and the national institute of standards and technology for review and comment .
while dod osbp officials have recognized the importance of educating defense small businesses about cybersecurity , they have not identified and disseminated cybersecurity resources through their outreach and education efforts to businesses because they have been focused on other priorities , such as developing a training curriculum for dod professionals who work with small businesses .
