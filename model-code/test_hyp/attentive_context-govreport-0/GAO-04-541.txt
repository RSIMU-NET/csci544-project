in this context , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the foundation's roles and responsibilities for raising funds to support the park service , ( 2 ) the amount and kinds of donations the foundation has raised between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the contributions obtained by the foundation assist the park service in addressing park priorities .
for the last few decades , the national park service ( park service ) has relied increasingly on private donations in meeting its mission to promote and protect the national parks .
to improve its communication with the park service and improve management controls , we are making four recommendations to the national park foundation , namely that it take the following four steps: enter into an overall written agreement with the park service that includes its fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the foundation and the park service in their partnering relationship ; identify and document all current and future fund - raising agreements made with the park service , specifying the terms of work agreed to by each party ; develop a process , either through training or briefings , to help ensure complete and consistent understanding of its fund - raising strategy and roles and responsibilities with the park service headquarters , regional , and local park officials ; and in developing its fund - raising approach , consider the list of individual park priorities compiled and provided by the park service â€” this list could be used for identifying patterns of park needs for systemwide projects as well as for identifying specific needs that may be of interest to potential donors .
however , there have been some recent concerns within the park service that the foundation is not supporting its priority needs .
to reduce the confusion and misunderstanding and improve communication between the national park foundation and the park service , we are recommending that the secretary of the interior require the director of the national park service to take the following five steps: work collaboratively with the foundation to develop an overall written agreement that , among other things , articulates the foundation's fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the foundation and the park service in their partnering relationship ; identify and document all current and future fund - raising agreements made with the foundation , specifying the terms of work agreed to by each party ; provide a list of individual park project priorities , including those potentially fundable by nonprofits , and communicate them to the foundation for consideration in fund - raising ; develop and implement internal controls such that fund - raising agreements are documented in writing and subsequent performance is tracked against the agreement ; and clarify whether the exclusivity terms in foundation agreements with proud partners apply to park - based cause - related marketing arrangements and communicate this information to all of the park service's fund - raising partners .
although national parks remain primarily a public responsibility , parks benefit from other sources of support , including individuals , corporations , and nonprofit organizations .
however , the proper implementation of these steps should help resolve the communication problems that exist between the foundation and the park service and strengthen their partnership .
