the joint polar satellite system ( jpss ) and the geostationary operational environmental satellite - r ( goes - r ) programs are meant to replace current operational satellites , and both are considered critical to the united states' ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting .
as requested , this statement summarizes our two reports being released today on ( 1 ) the status , plans , and risks for jpss and ( 2 ) the status , schedule management process , and risk management process within the goes - r program .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on two satellite acquisition programs within the department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) .
they each contain a detailed overview of our scope and methodology , including the steps we took to assess the reliability of cost and schedule data .
as noted in those reports , we found that the jpss cost and goes - r contractor cost data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes .
in early 2012 , in response to congressional direction , dod decided to terminate the program because it still has two satellites to launch within its legacy defense meteorological satellite program .
dod is currently identifying alternative means to fulfill its future environmental satellite requirements .
both the jpss and goes - r programs face risks going forward during their development ; implementing the recommendations in our accompanying reports should help mitigate those risks .
further , while we found that the goes - r schedule and management reserve data were not sufficiently reliable , we reported on the data's shortcomings in our report .
in preparing this testimony , we relied on the work supporting those reports .
as a result , noaa has improved its ability to fully meet its mission - essential function of providing continuous satellite imagery in support of weather forecasting .
goes - r has also encountered a number of technical challenges , some of which remain to be fully addressed .
this could result in the need for noaa to rely on older satellites that are not fully functional .
so far , noaa has been able to address certain delays and technical challenges with an available contingency reserve , in which a portion of the program's budget is allocated to mitigate risks and manage problems as they surface during development , and has not changed its 2007 cost estimates for the development of the first two program satellites .
any delays in the launch readiness date for goes - r , which is already at risk due to increasing development costs and use of program reserves , would further increase the probability of a gap in satellite continuity .
execute the program's risk management policies and procedures to provide more timely and adequate evaluations and reviews of newly identified risks , and provide more information , including documented handling strategies , for all ongoing and newly - identified risks in the risk register .
in addition to polar - orbiting satellites , noaa operates goes as a two - satellite geostationary satellite system that is primarily focused on the united states .
while the goes - r program has made progress in completing its design , many key milestones were completed later than planned .
