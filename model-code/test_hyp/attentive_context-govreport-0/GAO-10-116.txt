our objectives for this review were to describe ( 1 ) the known water resource effects of biofuel production in the united states ; ( 2 ) the agricultural conservation practices and technological innovations that exist or are being developed to address these effects and any barriers that may prevent the adoption of these practices and technologies ; and ( 3 ) key research needs regarding the effects of biofuel production on water resources .
to understand the potential effects of increased biofuel production on water resources , you asked us to describe ( 1 ) the known water resource effects of increased biofuel production in the united states ; ( 2 ) the agricultural conservation practices and technological innovations that exist or are being developed to address these effects , and any barriers that may prevent the adoption of these practices and technologies ; and ( 3 ) key research needs regarding the effects of biofuel production on water resources .
in recent years , the federal government has increasingly encouraged the use of biofuels and other alternatives to petroleum in response to concerns over u.s. dependence on imported oil , climate change , and other issues .
the united states is the largest user of petroleum in the world , consuming 19.4 million barrels per day in 2008 , over half of which is imported .
the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa ) expanded the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) by requiring that u.s. transportation fuel contain 9 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2008 and increasing this amount annually to 36 billion gallons in 2022 .
even in water - rich states , such as iowa , concerns have arisen over the effects of increased biofuel production , and research is needed to assess the hydrology and quality of a state's aquifers to help ensure it is on a path to sustainable production , according to one state official .
given the maturity of the corn ethanol industry , the extent of knowledge about the effects on water supply and quality from cultivation of corn and its conversion into ethanol , and the uncertainty related to the effects of next generation biofuel production , we believe the balance in the report is appropriate .
as biofuel production increases , questions have emerged about the effects that increased production could have on the nation's water resources .
moreover , although the shift toward next generation biofuels is a positive step in terms of sustainability , this industry is still developing and the full extent of the environmental benefits from this shift is still unknown .
biofuels , such as ethanol and biodiesel , can be produced domestically and are derived from renewable sources , such as corn , sugar cane , and soybeans .
doi also suggested that the report should include a discussion of the other environmental impacts of biofuel production , such as effects on wildlife habitat or effects on soil .
these groups included relevant state agencies , including those responsible for oversight of agriculture , environmental quality , and water and soil resources ; federal agency officials with responsibility for a particular state or region , such as officials from the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) natural resources conservation service , and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) ; university researchers ; industry representatives ; and relevant nongovernmental organizations , such as environmental groups , state - level corn growers' associations , and ethanol producer associations .
