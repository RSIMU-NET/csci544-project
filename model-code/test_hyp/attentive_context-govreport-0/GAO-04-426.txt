to determine whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified , we reviewed national policies and procedures that included the national interagency standards for fire and fire aviation operations and the national interagency mobilization guide .

in this context , we reviewed ( 1 ) whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified ; ( 2 ) what resource management issues , if any , affected the ability of firefighting personnel to effectively fight the biscuit fire ; and ( 3 ) what differences , if any , existed in key personnel certification standards at federal and state agencies involved in fighting wildland fires — particularly in oregon — and whether any such differences affected efforts to respond to the biscuit fire .
since no request was made , the priority of the biscuit fire relative to other ongoing fires within the fortuna dispatch center's direct protection area was not discussed on the first day of the biscuit fire , and the outcome of such a request , had it been made , remains unclear .
