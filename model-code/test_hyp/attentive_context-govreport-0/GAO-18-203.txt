 ( recommendation 3 ) .
doj implemented 11 of our recommendations , including that doj develop performance measures for criminal debt collection and better coordinate internally and with federal courts .
 ( recommendation 1 ) to improve oversight of the collection of restitution we recommend that the attorney general: develop and implement performance measures and goals for each usao related to the collection of restitution , and measure progress towards meeting those goals .
developing and implementing performance measures and goals for each usao would allow doj to gauge usaos' success in collecting this restitution and , by extension , the department's success in achieving its major management initiative to increase the collection of debt .
the justice for all reauthorization act of 2016 contained a provision for us to review and assess the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 .
to address these findings , we made 24 recommendations , including 14 to doj , among other agencies .
usaos have identified a significant portion of outstanding restitution debt as uncollectible , but they have also identified $10 billion of outstanding restitution debt that could be collected .
once restitution is ordered by the court , doj is responsible for collecting restitution payments and has delegated these activities to financial litigation units ( flu ) within each u.s. attorney's office ( usao ) .
to what extent has doj conducted oversight on the collection of restitution ? .
the impact of crime on victims often has significant emotional , psychological , physical , financial , and social consequences .
we are making three recommendations , including one to the judiciary and two to doj .
doj took action to address the inspector general's recommendations by reviewing the system it uses to prioritize debt collection actions , by incorporating discussion of asset recovery into its training program , and by initiating a comprehensive study to review existing protocols and structures to improve doj's ability to collect debts owed to crime victims .
 ( recommendation 2 ) in cases where forfeited assets were not used to compensate victims , gather information on reasons why forfeited assets were not used for victims .
doing so would better position doj to take action to increase the use of forfeited assets to compensate eligible victims if warranted and to provide assurance that it is maximizing the use of asset forfeiture in satisfying restitution debts , one of the agency's most effective mechanisms for satisfying restitution .
while doj has delegated collection activities for restitution to usaos , it could provide better oversight to ensure it is making reasonable efforts to collect restitution and meeting its responsibility to victims .
the collection of federal criminal restitution has been a longstanding challenge .
further , doj could use performance information to improve the practices of offices in seeking and recovering restitution , consistent with a requirement in the justice for all reauthorization act of 2016 .
among other aspects of usao operations , these internal evaluations review the extent to which each flu is complying with statutory and doj requirements related to debt collection , has sufficient program resources , and adequately manages its caseload .
finally , doj could gain greater visibility into the use of forfeited assets to compensate victims by gathering information on cases in which victims have been identified and restitution is anticipated but forfeited assets are not used , and any reasons why .
