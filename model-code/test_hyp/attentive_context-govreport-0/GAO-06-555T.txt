my testimony today is based on our report being released today , entitled nuclear power plants: efforts made to upgrade security , but the nuclear regulatory commission's design basis threat process should be improved ( gao - 06-388 ) .
our march 2006 report examined ( 1 ) the process nrc used to develop the april 2003 dbt for nuclear power plants , ( 2 ) the actions nuclear power plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised dbt , and ( 3 ) nrc's efforts to strengthen the conduct of its force - on - force inspections .
to defend against a potential terrorist attack , nrc issues and enforces security - related regulations and orders , and nuclear power plant licensees implement security measures to meet nrc requirements .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent work on security of the nation's 103 operating commercial nuclear power plants , located at 65 sites in 31 states .
as you know , nuclear power plants were among the targets considered in the original plan for the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
furthermore , according to the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , which regulates and oversees the safe operation and security of nuclear power plants , there continues to be a general credible threat of a terrorist attack on the nation's commercial nuclear power plants , in particular by al qaeda and like - minded islamic terrorist groups .
in november 2004 , nrc began using its force - on - force inspection program to test sites' ability to defend against the revised dbt .
after revising the dbt , nrc required nuclear power plant sites to submit new security plans by april 29 , 2004 , for its review and approval and to implement the security described in their new plans by october 29 , 2004 .
nrc originally included this provision in its regulations in 1967 ( prior to issuing the first dbt for nuclear power plants ) .
despite these differences , both agencies used similar intelligence information to derive key aspects of their dbts .
in particular , nrc formulates a design basis threat ( dbt ) — the threat that plants must defend against — and tests plants' ability to defend against the dbt .
as a result , one of the nrc threat assessment staff's major challenges has been to decide how to apply this limited information to nuclear power plants in the united states .
inclusion of such weapons in the nrc dbt for nuclear power plants would have required plants to take substantial additional security measures .
such an attack could cause a release of radioactive material and endanger public health and safety through exposure to an elevated level of radiation .
nrc has made a number of improvements to the force - on - force inspection program , several of which address recommendations we made in our september 2003 report on nrc's oversight of security at commercial nuclear power plants .
terrorist attacks have generally occurred outside the united states , and intelligence information specific to nuclear power plants is very limited .
nrc periodically reviews the potential terrorist threat to determine whether to make changes to the dbt .
