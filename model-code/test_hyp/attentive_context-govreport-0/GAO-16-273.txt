the general services administration ( gsa ) annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars making major and minor repairs and alterations to the more than 1,500 federally owned buildings that it holds .
this report addresses ( 1 ) information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions during repair and alteration projects in federally owned buildings held by gsa and ( 2 ) how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen site conditions .
to improve risk assessments for repair and alteration projects , we recommend that the administrator of gsa develop and implement a plan to periodically analyze information gsa already collects , for example , based on a representative sample of repair and alterations projects , in order to: identify the specific impacts unforeseen conditions have had on project costs , schedules , and scope of work ; analyze the causes of these conditions for those projects that experienced unforeseen site conditions ; and identify actions that will be taken to address the potential causes of unforeseen site conditions .
the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) identify information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions during selected repair and alteration projects in federally owned buildings held by the general services administration ( gsa ) and to ( 2 ) determine how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen site conditions .
repairs and alterations are expensive ( over $1.2 billion to address immediate deferred maintenance and repair needs as estimated by gsa ) , and , therefore , it is imperative that the program operate as efficiently and effectively as possible and that costs , schedule delays , and project changes are minimized to the greatest degree possible .
gsa's repair and alterations program has become increasingly important over time as the inventory of buildings continues to age and deterioration and deferred maintenance increase .
gsa estimated that at the end of fiscal year 2015 it had over $1.2 billion in deferred maintenance and repair work .
these buildings are used for a variety of purposes — from office space to warehouses — and are critical for federal agencies to fulfill their missions .
in 2001 , the gsa inspector general's office , which reviewed 45 repair and alteration projects , reported that unforeseen site conditions in 10 projects completed in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 accounted for about $22 million , or about 43 percent , of cost growth on these projects .
some of this work is initiated by gsa and some at the request of tenant agencies .
the possible causes of the remaining unforeseen site conditions were tenant alterations unknown to gsa ( 2 out of 11 projects ) , a building's not being originally built up to code ( 2 of 11 projects ) , and difficulty faced by gsa in accessing the building for surveying and testing ( 4 out of 11 projects ) .
however , gsa can improve how it identifies types of project risks and minimize their impacts on repair and alteration projects .
to identify how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen site conditions , we reviewed documents related to gsa's capital - planning process and project management requirements .
