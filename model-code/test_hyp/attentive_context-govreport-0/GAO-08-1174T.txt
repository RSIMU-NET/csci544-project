as agreed with the subcommittee , i will discuss the preparations under way at the government accountability office ( gao ) to meet our responsibilities under the presidential transition act to assist the incoming administration as well as the 111th congress .
in addition , this will be the first post - 9 / 11 transition , with a relatively new department of homeland security ( dhs ) grappling with the threats we face here at home while experiencing its first change in administration .
the act specifically identifies gao as a source of briefings and other materials to help inform presidential appointees of the major management issues , risks , and challenges they will face .
the 2009 presidential transition will be a unique and critical period for the united states .
for example , we update our high - risk list with the start of each new congress to focus attention on areas in need of broad - based transformation or susceptible to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
while as a legislative branch agency gao has extensive experience helping each new congress , the presidential transition act points to gao as a resource for incoming administrations as well .
during the last presidential transition , we identified for congress and the then new administration key program and management issues in the major departments and across government .

more recently , we assisted the 110th congress by suggesting 36 areas for oversight based on our work .
