specifically , we ascertained ( 1 ) the rationale for , and costs associated with , the construction , maintenance , and operations of the santa lucia base , an antidrug base in the upper huallaga valley ; ( 2 ) the subsequent rationale for discontinuing support of the santa lucia base ; ( 3 ) and the current status of u.s. efforts to restructure antidrug programs in peru .
however , before sharing of information can resume , the president must determine that ( 1 ) illicit drug trafficking poses a national security threat to peru and ( 2 ) peru has appropriate procedures in place to protect against the innocent loss of life .
nearly two - thirds of the world's coca crop is grown in peru .
in response to your request , we are providing you information on u.s. antidrug efforts in peru .
gradually , the united states began to ( 1 ) support peruvian efforts to eradicate coca seedbeds and ( 2 ) conduct law enforcement operations against drug - trafficking activities .
the departments of state and defense and the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) coordinate antidrug activities with peruvian law enforcement and military organizations .
about $6.4 million was spent for police support at santa lucia , including ( 1 ) per diem for peruvian police officers stationed at the base to provide security for the base and for workers on eradication missions and ( 2 ) commodities used by the police to support the base .
most of that coca is processed into cocaine base , which is flown to colombia to make cocaine for shipment to the united states and europe .
the congress reduced the state department's annual international narcotics control program request for fiscal year 1994 from $148 million to $100 million .
since the 1980s , the primary coca - growing and drug - trafficking activities in peru have been in its upper huallaga valley .
although the impact that the policy has had on the flow of drugs being shipped from peru to colombia is unclear , it is clear that pilots flying between peru and colombia have changed their operations , since there is little fear of interception by u.s. and peruvian forces as long as detection capabilities remain negligible and there is no sharing of information .
to obtain information for this report , we interviewed officials and reviewed pertinent documents at the departments of state and defense and the drug enforcement administration in washington , d.c. ; the u.s. southern command in panama ; and the u.s. embassy in lima , peru .
u.s. officials in peru said that since the policy change , drug traffickers have changed their operations and ( 1 ) have begun multiple flights with smaller drug loads and ( 2 ) have begun flying during the day , and some traffickers have doubled their time on the ground .
the officials stated that the policy decision had impacted on their ability to conduct antidrug operations .
as of november 30 , 1994 , the sharing of information had not yet resumed .
thus , they ( 1 ) used fewer flights with larger drug loads , ( 2 ) flew mainly in the early evening hours , and ( 3 ) spent on an average only about 10 to 12 minutes in loading and unloading their cargoes .
