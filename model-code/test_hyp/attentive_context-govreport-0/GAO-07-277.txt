it ( 1 ) describes the policies , regulations , and guidelines that agencies have established to mark and publicize foreign assistance ; ( 2 ) describes how the department of state ( state ) , usaid , and other agencies mark and publicize foreign assistance ; and ( 3 ) identifies key challenges that agencies face in marking and publicizing foreign assistance .
the negative perceptions of the united states , associated with u.s. foreign policy initiatives , have underscored the importance of the united states presenting a complete portrayal of the benefits that many countries in the world derive from u.s. foreign assistance efforts .
congress has expressed concerns that the united states has frequently understated or not publicized information about its foreign assistance programs and , as a result , the generosity of the people of the united states has not been fully understood abroad .
the united states is one of the largest donors of foreign assistance to countries around the world ; however , many of the recipients of this aid are unaware that it is provided by the united states .
to help the united states ensure that recipients of its foreign assistance are aware that this assistance is provided by the united states and its taxpayers , we are making two recommendations .
a recent worldwide survey by the pew research center and our reports have noted that negative perceptions of the united states increased in recent years in response to u.s. foreign policy initiatives , particularly in the middle east .
to facilitate state's effort to implement its planned governmentwide guidance for marking and publicizing all u.s. foreign assistance programs and activities , we recommend that the secretary of state , in consultation with other u.s. executive agencies , establish interagency agreements for marking and publicizing all u.s. foreign assistance .
to enhance u.s. marking and publicity efforts , and to improve the information used to measure the impact of u.s. marking and publicizing programs , we recommend that the secretary of state , in consultation with other u.s. executive agencies , develop a strategy , which appropriately utilizes techniques such as surveys and focus groups , to better assess the impact of u.s. marking and publicity programs and activities on public awareness .
according to the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) , marking of foreign assistance refers to using methods such as applying graphic identities or logos to program materials or project signage to visibly acknowledge contributors and identify organizations supporting the work .
usaid has begun to develop guidance on measuring the effectiveness of its publicity efforts .
we conducted fieldwork in washington , d.c. ; new york city ; indonesia ; liberia ; montenegro ; peru ; serbia ; and south africa .
in fiscal year 2005 , the united states provided about $20 billion in humanitarian and development assistance throughout the world to , among other things , relieve suffering , educate children , feed the hungry , promote economic opportunity , and support democracy and human rights .
as requested , this report focuses on the efforts of key u.s. agencies to mark or publicize u.s. foreign assistance .
usaid has only completed a limited number of surveys to measure public awareness of u.s. assistance , including a public opinion survey of u.s. post - tsunami efforts in indonesia .
