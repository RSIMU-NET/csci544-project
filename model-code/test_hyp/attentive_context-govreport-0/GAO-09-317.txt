federal , state , and local decision makers have had a renewed interest in looking at how high speed rail might fit into our national transportation system and address increasing mobility constraints on the nation's highways and at airports due to congestion .
although the current economic downturn has recently reduced the level of highway and air travel , projections show that intercity travel will grow again and that existing transportation capacity limitations will constrain mobility .
to better understand the role that high speed rail service could play in the u.s. transportation system , we were asked to assess ( 1 ) the factors affecting the economic viability of high speed rail projects — that is , whether a project's total social benefits offset or justify the total social costs — and difficulties in determining the economic viability of proposed projects ; ( 2 ) the challenges that u.s. project sponsors experience in developing and financing high speed rail projects ; and ( 3 ) the federal role in the potential development of high speed rail systems .
the department of transportation ( dot ) estimates that several intercity highways linking major urban markets will experience significant congestion by 2035 .
to better understand the potential viability of high speed rail service in the united states , we reviewed ( 1 ) the factors affecting the economic viability of high speed rail projects — that is , whether a project's total social benefits offset or justify the total social costs — and difficulties in determining the economic viability of proposed projects ; ( 2 ) the challenges that u.s. project sponsors experience in developing and financing high speed rail projects ; and ( 3 ) the federal role in the potential development of high speed rail systems .
the recently enacted american recovery and reinvestment of act of 2009 ( arra ) appropriated $8 billion for high speed rail and intercity passenger rail congestion and capital grants ( the latter of which were authorized by the priia ) , with priority given to projects that support the development of high speed rail service .
ensure fiscal sustainability .
in addition , the dependence of growing highway and air travel on fossil fuels raises significant environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions .
as a result , transportation decision makers are exploring options that not only expand transportation capacity and relieve increasing congestion but also minimize the deleterious environmental impacts of increasing highway and air travel .
moreover , in october 2008 , congress enacted the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2008 ( priia ) , which establishes a program to develop high speed rail corridors — authorizing $1.5 billion in funding for project development .
the failure to incorporate such measures is a common drawback of federal transportation programs .
develop guidance and methods for ensuring reliability of ridership and other forecasts used to determine the viability of high speed rail projects and support the need for federal grant assistance .
this would include consideration of such things as whether funding is affordable and stable over the short - and long - term ; the extent to which costs and revenues are shared among federal , state , and local participants ; and whether any project fees and taxes are aligned with use and benefits .
