gao , national security: key challenges and solutions to strengthen interagency collaboration , gao - 10-822t ( washington , d.c.: june 9 , 2010 ) .
among the key practices we identified were ( 1 ) defining and articulating a common federal outcome ; ( 2 ) establishing strategies that are mutually reinforcing or joint to help the agencies align their activities , core processes , and resources to accomplish their common outcome ; ( 3 ) agreeing on roles and responsibilities ; ( 4 ) establishing compatible policies , procedures , and other means to operate across agency boundaries ; and ( 5 ) including collaboration competencies in designing performance management systems and set performance expectations for collaboration to reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts .
our objectives for this engagement were to ( 1 ) examine selected u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) and small business administration ( sba ) disaster assistance programs and the types of small agricultural producers that they cover ; ( 2 ) identify the main factors , if any , that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers' participation in disaster assistance from fsa and sba ; and ( 3 ) examine fsa and sba efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers .
develop a strategy to better formalize collaboration through means such as developing a memorandum of understanding on interagency collaboration and educating staff about the other agency's disaster assistance programs .
farmers and other agricultural producers are exposed to natural disasters , such as droughts , floods , hurricanes , and tornadoes .
small agricultural producers , which the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) describes as a diverse group that produces a range of food and fiber and that can include family farms , commodity producers , aquaculture ( such as farmed fish and shellfish ) producers , nursery producers ( such as trees and plants ) , and other farmers and ranchers .
moreover , fsa's general lack of awareness about sba's disaster assistance programs and sba's limited understanding of the factors that might lead small aquaculture and nursery producers to repay their loans reduce both agencies' abilities to fully serve these producers .
a new farm bill was being debated as of august 2012 , and the final bill may reauthorize some of these programs and may include retroactive assistance for damages resulting from natural disasters occurring after september 30 , 2011 .
to help ensure that small aquaculture and nursery producers are aware of the disaster assistance programs available to them , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture and the administrator of the small business administration direct fsa and sba officials to take the following two actions: conduct targeted outreach to small aquaculture and nursery producers , for example , by building on existing agency outreach programs .
both usda , through its farm service agency ( fsa ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) are major sources of disaster assistance , but there is little overlap in the populations served by the fsa and sba programs .
in this report , our objectives were to ( 1 ) examine fsa and sba disaster assistance programs and the coverage they provide small producers ; ( 2 ) identify the main factors , if any , that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers' participation in disaster assistance programs from fsa and sba ; and ( 3 ) examine fsa and sba efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers .
