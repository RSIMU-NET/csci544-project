our objectives were to describe the ( 1 ) age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce and the extent to which agencies hire and retain older workers ; ( 2 ) workforce challenges that federal agencies face and the strategies they use to recruit and retain older workers to help meet these challenges ; and ( 3 ) actions the office of personnel management ( opm ) , as the federal government's human capital manager , has taken to help agencies hire and retain an experienced , skilled workforce .
our report builds on our earlier testimony before your committee and addresses the following: ( 1 ) the age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce and the extent to which federal agencies are hiring and retaining older workers ; ( 2 ) the workforce challenges that federal agencies face , and the strategies they use to recruit and retain older workers to help meet these challenges ; and ( 3 ) the actions that the office of personnel management ( opm ) is taking to help agencies hire and retain an experienced skilled workforce in its role as the federal government's human capital manager .
to report on how some federal agencies are addressing their workforce challenges , we conducted in - depth reviews of three agencies â€” the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the social security administration ( ssa ) , and the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) .
like the nation's workforce as a whole , the proportion of older workers in the federal workforce is growing , and more and more workers are becoming eligible to retire .
to better assist agencies in attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce , we recommend that the director of opm develop a systematic approach , which may include communicating through the chco council , to share information broadly across the federal government about agency - developed promising practices in recruitment and retention of older , experienced workers to meet their workforce needs .
over the past several years , many have projected a huge retirement wave as the baby boom generation ages .
current employment conditions aside , hiring and retaining older , experienced workers could be part of a longer - term national strategy to ensure an adequate workforce as an aging population , coupled with slow labor growth , poses economic challenges to the nation .
it remains unclear when the expected retirement wave will peak , but over time , more and more of the baby boom generation will eventually retire .
5 ) ; the current economic situation may result in even higher retention rates .
as a result , the federal government and other employers may face increased competition in hiring skilled workers , and unless they develop effective retention strategies , employers will need to look more aggressively for workers with the right skills to meet their needs .
although opm has taken steps to address areas of concern , it could do more to disseminate information across the federal government on agency - developed promising practices to recruit and retain older workers to meet workforce needs .
despite their differences , hud , ssa , and usaid share common workforce challenges .
