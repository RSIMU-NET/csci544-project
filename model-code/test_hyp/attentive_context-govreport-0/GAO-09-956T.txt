as you know , to be competitive in the global economy , the united states relies heavily on innovation through research and development ( r&d ) .
the sbir program is currently being considered by the congress for reauthorization , and both the house and senate have recently passed bills to reauthorize the program .
the act established the sbir program to stimulate technological innovation , use small businesses to meet federal r&d needs , foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation , and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal r&d .
recognizing the potential of small businesses to be a source of significant innovation , the congress passed the small business innovation development act of 1982 .
although sba did not meet its statutorily mandated deadline of june 2001 , the database has been operational since october 2008 , and contains limited new information but may also contain inaccurate historical data .
sba has established , through a policy directive , a series of data elements for all the agencies to submit for its public tech - net database .
the act provided for a three - phased program: phase i to determine the feasibility and scientific and technical merit of a proposed research idea ; phase ii to further develop the idea ; and phase iii to commercialize the resulting product or process with no further sbir funding .
in 2005 awards from three agencies — the department of defense ( dod ) , national institutes of health ( nih ) , and national aeronautics and space agency ( nasa ) — accounted for the majority of sbir funds .
in this context , you asked us to summarize the successes and challenges that our past work has identified about the sbir program , summarize the concerns we have previously identified on sba's efforts to establish an interagency database that includes information on sbir applicants and awards , and describe the process that agencies use to determine the eligibility of sbir applicants for the program .
to address these concerns , we recommended that sba take three actions: ( 1 ) determine if the certification form needed to be improved and make any necessary revisions , ( 2 ) develop definitions and guidelines for what constitutes “duplicative” research , and ( 3 ) provide interagency access to current information regarding sbir awards in response to our recommendations , sba strengthened the language agencies use in their application packages to clearly warn applicants about the illegality of entering into multiple agreements for essentially the same effort .
we are pleased to be here today to testify on our past work on the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program .
from its inception in fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 2004 , federal agencies had awarded over $17 billion for more than 82,000 projects .
this database was to be established by mid - 2001 and made available only to government agencies and certain other authorized users .
each agency manages its own program , including targeting research areas , reviewing proposed projects , and making research awards through grants , contracts , or cooperative agreements .
federal agencies that have budgets of $100 million for research conducted by others , called extramural research , are required to use 2.5 percent of these budgets to establish and operate an sbir program .
