these set out the liability of an oil spill's "responsible parties" for the costs inflicted on others by the oil spill â€” in particular , cleanup costs and economic damages ( such as injury to natural resources , destruction of private property , and loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity ) .
congress has also addressed the compensatory liability provisions of the jones act and the death on the high seas act in connection with the deaths of 11 workers when the deepwater horizon platform exploded on april 20 .
since the deepwater horizon oil spill began on april 20 , 2010 , congress has given much attention to the compensatory liability provisions in the oil pollution act .
to reiterate , the function of these liability provisions is to compensate those injured ; that function determines the dollar amount of the liability .
also discussed in relation to the deepwater horizon oil spill are federal statutory provisions of a very different nature .
their function is not to compensate , but rather , like all civil and criminal penalties , to punish and / or deter .
on june 1 , 2010 , attorney general eric holder announced that the u.s. department of justice had launched a civil and criminal investigation into the gulf spill , including the deaths of the 11 workers on the deepwater horizon mobile offshore drilling unit .
as for civil penalty ceilings , congress has enacted the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of 1990 to ensure that inflation over a long period does not erode the deterrent force of a penalty ceiling .
these provisions , the topic of this report , impose civil and criminal penalties .
this act requires federal agencies to adjust at least once every four years the maximum ( and minimum , if any ) dollar amount on civil penalties within their jurisdiction to reflect movement in the consumer price index .
except for the migratory bird treaty act and occupational safety and health act , all the included laws expressly apply beyond the u.s. territorial sea , either out to the limit of the united states' exclusive economic zone at 200 nautical miles offshore , or , as applied to persons subject to u.s. jurisdiction , anywhere on the high seas .
that the federal laws listed herein extend to the gulf spill seems clear , notwithstanding that the spill site is 50 miles off the coast of louisiana , well beyond the territorial limits of the united states on the outer continental shelf .
it remains to be seen whether this one court's view will win acceptance by other courts , as to the endangered species act specifically or as to smaller - than - cfia penalty caps enacted post - cfia generally .
this report summarizes selected federal civil and criminal penalty provisions that may be found violated in connection with the gulf spill and related worker fatalities .
as for the migratory bird treaty act and occupational safety and health act , the outer continental shelf lands act broadly declares that the laws of the united states are extended to the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf , "and to all artificial islands , and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed" to explore for or produce resources .
