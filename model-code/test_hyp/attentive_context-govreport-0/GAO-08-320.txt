specifically , this report describes selected countries' ( 1 ) laws and policies enacted to regulate foreign investment to protect their national security interests and ( 2 ) implementation of those laws and policies .
the review of individual transactions has been delegated to an interagency committee , the committee on foreign investment in the united states ( cfius ) .
however , foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies can pose a significant challenge for the u.s. government because of the need to balance the benefits of foreign investment with national security concerns .
the united nations reported that between 2000 and 2006 , annual foreign direct investment in the united states averaged $144 billion , which is 16 percent of the world's total during that period .
u.s. investment policy is anchored in the belief that global investment is beneficial and necessary to bring economic prosperity worldwide .
in july 2007 , the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 amended exon - florio to , among other things , expand the factors to be considered in deciding what could affect national security and bring greater transparency to the cfius review process .
the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit transactions that could result in foreign control of u.s. companies if the transaction threatens to impair national security .
in its letter , treasury reemphasized the commitment of the united states to an open investment policy and stated that countries' general investment policies and the relationship of foreign investment reviews to those policies are important in understanding investment review regimes .
to better understand how other countries deal with similar challenges , you asked us to identify other countries' approaches for addressing the issues that exon - florio is intended to address .
as is the case in the united states , each of the countries we reviewed has enacted laws and instituted policies regulating foreign investment â€” often to address national security concerns .
this report updates the 1996 report and also expands it by describing foreign direct investment policies and processes in six additional countries: canada , china , india , the netherlands , russia , and the united arab emirates ( uae ) .
treasury coordinated with other cfius agencies in providing comments .
in addition , in 1996 we issued a report that describes how four major investors in the united states - - - france , germany , japan , and the united kingdom - - - - monitored foreign investment in their own countries to protect national security - related interests .
our selection of the countries was based on a number of factors: we chose countries with which the united states has a large reciprocal investment relationship , countries with diverse investment controls , countries chosen for regional diversity , and those selected in prior gao work .
many of the countries have concerns about national security - related issues .
the deputy secretary of the treasury testified in 2005 that there is an inherent link between our national security interests and a strong u.s. economy that facilitates free and fair trade .
however , changes to regulations affecting foreign investment have been discussed in these countries .
