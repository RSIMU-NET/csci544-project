some observers argue that a fully - developed policy should take into account issues such as international competitiveness , the communications needs of public safety agencies and the military , the role of wireless technology in economic growth , and the encouragement of new technologies that make spectrum use more efficient and more beneficial to society as a whole .
for the immediate future , congress may choose to debate and act on questions such as reforming spectrum management and allocation mechanisms .
over time , developments in technology may significantly increase the amount of useable spectrum and consequently the ease with which a policy of equitable allocation and use can be crafted .
the federal communications commission ( fcc ) is responsible for overseeing licensed and unlicensed spectrum used for commercial purposes and by state and local agencies , including first responders , as well as most other radio frequencies not assigned for federal use .
among the subsequent laws that deal with spectrum policy and auctions are the balanced budget act of 1997 , the auction reform act of 2002 , the commercial spectrum enhancement act of 2004 , and the deficit reduction act of 2005 .
on january 27 , 2003 the supreme court ruled in favor of nextwave , agreeing with the earlier court of appeals decision that the fcc did not have the authority to recover the licenses .
however , many have questioned whether auction policy should be supplemented more aggressively with other market - driven solutions , and whether the existing auction process and administration can be improved .
the fcc has concluded that auctioning of spectrum licenses has contributed to the rapid deployment of new wireless technologies , increased competition in the marketplace , and encouraged participation by small businesses .
radio frequency spectrum is managed primarily by regulations that set rules , for example , for permissible uses , certification of devices , requirements for public safety , and the acquisition of licenses .
given the number of objectives in the allocation and use of spectrum , and the differing solutions for achieving them , choices made for 700 mhz could be far - reaching in setting the direction for future policy decisions .
103-66 ) added section 309 ( j ) to the communications act , authorizing the fcc to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services .
the omnibus budget reconciliation act amended the communications act of 1934 with a number of important provisions affecting the availability of spectrum licenses and authorized the fcc to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services .
aws - 1 was completed on september 18 , 2006 , with nearly $13.9 billion in completed bids .
the main category of services for which licenses may be auctioned are called commercial mobile radio services ( cmrs ) , which include advanced wireless services ( aws ) , personal communications service ( pcs ) , cellular , and most specialized mobile radio services ( smr ) with some exceptions , cmrs providers are regulated as common carriers to ensure regulatory parity among similar services that will compete against one another for subscribers .
although congress has a legislative role in spectrum management , the fcc routinely takes on the responsibility of making decisions about the assignment of spectrum for different uses and sets the rules for auctions of spectrum licenses .
