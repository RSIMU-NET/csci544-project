credible projections of the effects of policy proposals on federal spending and future retirees' income are necessary .
future demographic trends include a doubling of the nation's retiree population and only modest labor force growth , leading to concerns about retirement income adequacy for future generations .
experts consulted by gao cited priorities for improving retirement data that fit into two broad categories: ( 1 ) obtaining better data from employers on employee benefits and ( 2 ) obtaining better data by linking more individual and household surveys with administrative data ( such as employer records , and social security earnings history records ) .
because adequate data is critical to the analysis of retirement income and wealth , gao was asked to identify data improvements that experts say are a priority for the study of retirement income and wealth , as well as factors limiting efforts to obtain the needed information .
to increase their understanding about issues related to retirement , policymakers need credible projections of the effects of their proposals on federal spending and on future retirees' income .
in addition , federal agencies need to consider both the federal cost of these efforts and the financial and nonfinancial costs imposed on respondents in comparison with the benefits expected from improvements in data .
the plan should include cost - effective strategies to make better use of existing statistics by linking survey and administrative data , improve access to linked data consistent with privacy and confidentiality legislation , and improve data collected from employers related to retirement income and wealth .
to facilitate plan participants' , beneficiaries' , and analysts' timely access to information about employer - provided pension plans , the congress should consider directing the secretary of labor to obtain from plan administrators electronic filings of all spds and summaries of material modifications required by erisa and make them publicly available in electronic form .
information from employers , such as documents describing the features of their pension plans , would enable analysts to forecast future retirement income of pension holders , based on the specific features of their pension plans and the likely distribution of pension income and wealth for different segments of the population .
the recommendations of these experts focused primarily on improved use of existing data to support policy analysis , and not on additional data collection .
while taking into account these cost considerations , respondent concerns about increased reporting burden , and agency concerns about maintaining confidentiality , the congress , and the departments of labor and the treasury could take the next steps to help fill some of the data needs .
in response to your request , as agreed , we identified ( 1 ) data improvements that experts say are a priority for the study of retirement income and wealth and ( 2 ) factors limiting efforts to obtain the needed information .
this should assist analysts of retirement income in obtaining information about the features of employer - sponsored benefit plans that are not electronically available .
in light of these demographic trends , policymakers have been moved to consider how the future economy can support the large retiree population , and whether retirement income levels will be adequate in the future .
