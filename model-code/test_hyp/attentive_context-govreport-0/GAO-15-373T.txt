our high - risk program , supported by this committee and the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs , has brought much - needed focus to problems impeding effective government and costing billions of dollars each year .
congressional oversight and legislative action have been critical to the progress that has been made .
congress passed numerous laws targeting both specific problems and the high - risk areas overall .
since 1990 , more than one - third of the areas previously designated as high risk have been removed from the high risk list because sufficient progress was made in addressing the problems identified .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) regularly convenes meetings with agency leaders and gao to discuss progress updates on high - risk issues .
since our last high - risk update in 2013 , solid , steady progress has been made in the vast majority of areas that remain on the list .
in addition , top administration officials have continued to show their commitment to ensuring that high - risk areas receive attention and oversight .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our 2015 high - risk update.since 1990 , we have regularly reported on government operations that we have identified as high risk due to their greater vulnerability to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy , efficiency , or effectiveness challenges .
nonetheless , 11 issues have been on the high risk list since the 1990s and 6 of these were on our original list of 14 areas in 1990 .
this year , due to significant progress made , we narrowed the high - risk designation for two areas — protecting public health through enhanced oversight of medical products and dod contract management .
lasting solutions to these and the other 30 high - risk areas offer the potential to save billions of dollars , dramatically improve service to the american public , and strengthen public confidence and trust in the performance and accountability of our national government .
while there has been notable progress , much remains to be done to address the 32 high - risk issues that are currently on our high risk list .
we also designated two new high - risk areas this year — managing risks and improving va health care and improving the management of it acquisitions and operations .
our high risk update report and website provide details for each of these issues , describing the nature of the risks , what actions have been taken to address them , and what remains to be done to make further progress.the details in our report , along with successful implementation by agencies and continued oversight by congress , can form a solid foundation for progress to address risks and improve programs and operations .
we have identified nine critical factors underlying successful major acquisitions that support the objective of improving the management of large - scale it acquisitions across the federal government: ( 1 ) program officials actively engaging with stakeholders ; ( 2 ) program staff having the necessary knowledge and skills ; ( 3 ) senior department and agency executives supporting the programs ; ( 4 ) end users and stakeholders involved in the development of requirements ; ( 5 ) end users participating in testing of system functionality prior to end user acceptance testing ; ( 6 ) government and contractor staff being stable and consistent ; ( 7 ) program staff prioritizing requirements ; ( 8 ) program officials maintaining regular communication with the prime contractor ; and ( 9 ) programs receiving sufficient funding .
