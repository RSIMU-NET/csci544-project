to analyze consumption in retirement and how target replacement rates are defined and used to assess retirement readiness , we examined ( 1 ) whether and how spending patterns have varied by age ; ( 2 ) the key factors used to develop target replacement rates for how much income workers need to replace in retirement ; and ( 3 ) the usefulness of information on replacement rates provided to workers by the department of labor .
this report assesses ( 1 ) whether and how spending patterns vary by age , ( 2 ) key factors used to develop target replacement rates , and ( 3 ) the usefulness of information on retirement replacement rates provided to workers by the department of labor .
whether older americans will have adequate income in retirement has been a longstanding concern for several reasons including the decline in defined benefit pensions , the growing responsibility for individuals to save for retirement through employer - sponsored defined contribution plans or on their own , and the financial challenges facing social security .
in recent years , numerous studies on the replacement rates that households should target have not resulted in a consensus recommendation , in part because estimates are heavily dependent on the underlying assumptions used to develop them .
to better predict how much income americans will need once they leave the workforce , many researchers use target replacement rates — the percentage of pre - retirement income needed to maintain a certain standard of living in retirement .
to accurately interpret the implications for retirement adequacy it is important for policy makers and individuals to better understand how these targets are developed .
our analysis focused on total replacement rates — the ratio of all income in retirement ( including social security , pension benefits , and retirement savings ) to pre - retirement earnings .
you asked us to review what consumption looks like in retirement and how replacement rates are defined , calculated , and used to assess retirement preparedness .
to help workers make appropriate adjustments to the replacement rates used in calculating their specific retirement income needs , the secretary of labor should take the following two actions: include in its retirement planning tools information about examples of individual circumstances that research has shown to result in higher or lower income replacement needs ( e.g. , household characteristics and income level ) and guidance on the direction and magnitude of the changes attributable to such circumstances as well as those due to particular lifestyle choices .
modify its retirement planning tools to allow for some user flexibility in adjusting the replacement rate used in calculating retirement income needs .
in its response , dol cited steps taken by the employee benefits security administration ( ebsa ) to ensure that retirement planning materials balance key information with usability of the tools , including working with key stakeholders and experts to develop and test materials .
researchers have also cited concerns about the usefulness of replacement rates in their current form .
in both cases , workers could reach retirement without adequate savings .
to address our recommendations for providing more information on using replacement rates and modifying tools to allow for more flexibility , ebsa plans to make two changes by june 2017 .
