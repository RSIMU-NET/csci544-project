on december 16 , 2009 , president obama signed the fy2010 department of transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies appropriation act into law ( divison a of the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 , p.l .
111-117 ) , after congress had passed the conference version of the bill on december 10 , 2006 .
the enacted bill provided a total of $122.1 billion , $15.1 billion ( 14.1% ) more than the equivalent figure provided in fy2009 and $1.1 billion less than the amount requested by the administration .
this was $16.2 billion ( 15.1% ) more than the amount enacted in the fy2009 thud appropriations act .
other factors , such as supplemental appropriations for response to disasters ( such as the damage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes in the fall of 2005 ) and changes in the makeup of the department of transportation ( portions of which were transferred to the department of homeland security in 2004 ) , also complicate comparisons of year - to - year funding .
the president's net fy2010 request for the programs covered by this appropriations bill was $123.2 billion ( after scorekeeping adjustments ) .
in 2003 , a new subcommittee ( homeland security ) was added ; in order to maintain the existing number of subcommittees at 13 , the transportation appropriations subcommittees were combined with the treasury , postal service , and general government appropriations subcommittees , becoming the subcommittees on transportation , treasury , and independent agencies .
the request for dot was $72.4 billion , $1.0 billion ( 1.4% ) more than the $71.5 billion of total new funding provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act .
the house committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees from 13 to 10 .
the difference was due to the president's request for $5 billion for a new independent federal agency , a national infrastructure bank .
the house - passed bill provided $47.1 billion , while the senate committee on appropriations recommended $45.8 billion .
the house and senate committees divided the responsibilities of the tthud subcommittees between two subcommittees: transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies ( thud ) ; and financial services and general government , whose jurisdiction included the treasury department , the judiciary , the executive office of the president , the district of columbia , and many of the independent agencies formerly under the jurisdiction of the tthud subcommittees .
also , congress was dealing with several major initiatives during 2009 , including energy and health care reform , in addition to dealing with the effects of the recession .
dot and hud received additional funding in fy2009 through the arra emergency stimulus act ( see appendix for more information ) .
the hud request was $45.5 billion , $4.0 billion ( 7.7% ) more than the comparable amount of new funding provided in the regular annual appropriation for fy2009 .
this change included combining the transportation , treasury , and independent agencies subcommittee with the district of columbia subcommittee ; to the resulting subcommittee , in addition , jurisdiction over appropriations for the department of housing and urban development and the judiciary , as well as several additional independent agencies , was added .
