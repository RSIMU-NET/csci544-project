it is a pleasure to be back before this subcommittee to discuss the progress and challenges associated with the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to transform its business operations .
specifically , i will discuss dod's efforts to ( 1 ) develop a comprehensive , integrated , enterprisewide business transformation plan and its related leadership approach and ( 2 ) comply with legislation that addresses business systems modernization and improving financial management accountability .
dod's current approach is clearly superior to its prior approach ; however , a number of formidable challenges remain .
since the first financial statement audit of a major dod component was attempted almost 20 years ago , we have reported that weaknesses in business operations not only adversely affect the reliability of reported financial data , but also the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of dod's operations .
as a result , progress on the full range of dod's business transformation challenges has been inconsistent , focusing thus far on enterprisewide transformation , with many challenges remaining concerning the transformation of the various military services and defense agencies .
among these difficult choices will be decisions about the affordability and sustainability of the continued growth in defense spending .
eight of these are specific to dod and include dod's overall approach to business transformation , business systems modernization , financial management , the personnel security clearance process , supply chain management , support infrastructure management , weapon systems acquisition , and contract management .
in fact , dod currently bears responsibility , in whole or in part , for 14 of our 26 high - risk areas .
our nation is not only threatened by external security threats , but also from within by growing fiscal imbalances due primarily to our aging population and rising health care costs .
congress , in part through the leadership of this subcommittee , passed legislation that codified many of our prior recommendations related to dod business systems modernization .
however , dod's ability to focus on this priority was overshadowed by the events of september 11 , 2001 , and the ensuing global war on terrorism , including military operations in iraq and afghanistan .
if left unchecked , these fiscal imbalances will ultimately impede economic growth , have an adverse effect on our future standard of living , and in due course affect our ability to address key national and homeland security needs .
in fact , because of the impact of the department's business operations on its warfighters , dod recognizes now , more than ever , the need to transform its business operations and provide transparency in this process .
in addition , dod shares responsibility for six governmentwide high - risk areas .
these trends are compounded by the near - term deficits arising from new discretionary and mandatory spending as well as lower revenues as a share of the economy .
dod's business area weaknesses result in reduced efficiencies , ineffective performance , and inadequate accountability to congress and the american people , wasting billions of dollars each year at a time when dod is competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained environment .
furthermore , irrespective of the size of the defense budget , the taxpayers and warfighters deserve more effective management of dod's overall resources .
