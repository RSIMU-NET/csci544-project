as congress considers policies to achieve more robust growth in the u.s. economy , it must consider the full range of tools available to further growth and create new jobs for u.s. workers .
thank you for the opportunity to appear today before the subcommittees to provide our perspective on the role of the u.s. export - import bank ( ex - im ) in promoting exports and achieving other u.s. policy goals .
as the official export credit agency of the united states , ex - im has a key role in helping many u.s. firms achieve sales in foreign markets .
some of these tools are related to promoting exports , which can have broad benefits to the u.s. economy .
in addition to establishing ex - im's broad mandate of supporting u.s. employment through exports , congress has laid out specific , targeted goals for the bank in areas such as increasing financing for environmentally beneficial exports and expanding services to small and minority - owned businesses .
i will also describe progress ex - im has made in achieving the specific targets set by congress , as well as some challenges the bank faces in meeting those targets .
today , i will provide some broad observations regarding ex - im's contribution to the export promotion goals announced in the president's national export initiative .
these observations are based on a range of work that we have conducted for congress over recent years on ex - im as well as on the numerous other u.s. agencies involved in export promotion .
how any sharp increase in ex - im financing levels will affect specific targets we have described is not clear , and is likely to be an area requiring further discussion on how to balance these overall priorities .
more broadly , ex - im faces the challenge of contributing to the doubling of u.s. exports along with meeting other congressional requirements , including operating at little or no cost to the taxpayer .
gao made several recommendations to ex - im for improving its performance standards for small business .
they include , for example , launching new products designed to ensure credit is available to small and medium - sized enterprises ( sme ) ; focusing efforts on high - potential industries such as medical technology , renewable power , and transportation ; increasing the number and scope of partnerships with financial intermediaries ; and introducing a simplified application for credit insurance .
however , the goal of doubling u.s. exports in 5 years is an ambitious goal and would require not only increased activity by agencies such as ex - im but also increases in demand in key nations around the world .
while ex - im has had more success in achieving the congressional targets for small business than for environmentally beneficial exports , opportunities remain for a more strategic use of resources and for better communication with congress and other stakeholders .
gao has reported on ex - im's efforts to achieve specific targets set by congress regarding the composition of ex - im's export financing .
chairmen , the national export initiative has focused the spotlight on u.s. agencies that assist u.s. exporters as a way of expanding economic growth and creating jobs in the united states .
