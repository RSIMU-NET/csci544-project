generally , dod supports civil authorities through its defense support of civil authorities ( dsca ) mission .
the department of defense ( dod ) recognizes that a disruptive , manipulative , or destructive cyberattack could present a significant risk to u.s. economic and national security if lives are lost ; property , destroyed ; policy objectives , harmed ; or economic interests , affected and that the department must be prepared to support civil authorities in all domains — including in cyberspace .
dod was required to develop its plan by may 2016 ( 180 days after the national defense authorization act was signed into law ) ; however , the department did not complete its plan until april 2017 .
the presidential policy directive on united states cyber incident coordination states that significant cyber incidents are occurring with increasing frequency , impacting public and private infrastructure in the united states .
with the president's decision to elevate cybercom to a unified combatant command , such actions will also help as dod continues to plan to support civil authorities in response to a cyber incident and where cybercom has a significant role .
we are making the following two recommendations to dod: the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and global security , in coordination with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and other appropriate dod components , should update the department's cyber incident coordination training to incorporate the tenets of ppd - 41 .
taking action to improve the areas we have highlighted should help dod sustain the progress it has already made .
for example , u.s. northern command's ( northcom ) defense support of civil authorities response concept plan states that northcom would be the supported command for a mission to support civil authorities in responding to a domestic cyber incident .
section 1648 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2016 included a provision that dod develop a comprehensive plan for cybercom to support civil authorities in responding to cyberattacks by foreign powers against the united states .
we previously reported on dod's preparation efforts for providing support to civil authorities in response to cyber incidents .
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff should maintain a list of senior dod officials from organizations that could represent dod during a cyber unified coordination group and that are trained in the national incident management system .
however , without complying with the training requirements outlined in ppd - 41 and the dod significant cyber incident coordination procedures , the department cannot reasonably ensure it has the personnel with expertise to manage and respond to a significant cyber incident .
in april 2016 , we reported that dod's guidance — such as dod directive 3025.18 , defense support of civil authorities — did not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of key dod entities for domestic cyber incidents .
dod partially addressed three of the six elements required by the statute — to provide ( 1 ) descriptions of the roles , responsibilities , and expectations of the active and reserve components of the armed forces ; ( 2 ) the department's plans for coordination with heads of other federal agencies and state and local governments ; and ( 3 ) a list of exercises previously conducted that are used in the formulation of the plan .
