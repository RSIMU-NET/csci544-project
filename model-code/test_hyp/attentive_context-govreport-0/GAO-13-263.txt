since the early 1990's , the federal judiciary ( judiciary ) and the general services administration ( gsa ) have undertaken a multibillion - dollar federal courthouse construction program .
we recommended that gsa should: ( 1 ) ensure that courthouses are within their authorized size or notify congressional committees ; and that the judiciary should: ( 2 ) retain caseload projections to improve the accuracy of its 10-year judge planning and ( 3 ) establish and use courtroom - sharing policies based on scheduling and use data .
we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which the judiciary's capital - planning process aligns with leading practices and provides information needed for informed decision making and ( 2 ) the extent to which courthouse projects recommended for funding in fiscal years 2014 to 2018 were assessed under the judiciary's current capital - planning process .
specifically , 33 federal courthouses completed from 2000 to 2010 included 3.56 million square feet of extra space that cost an estimated $835 million to construct and $51 million annually to operate and maintain .
however , rising costs and other budget priorities have slowed the construction program .
to date this program has resulted in the completion of 78 new courthouses or annexes and 16 projects in various stages of development .
in light of this program history and the federal government's current fiscal challenges , you asked us to review the judiciary's current plans for new courthouse construction .
our recommendations have not yet been implemented .
gsa and the judiciary agreed with the recommendations , but expressed concerns with gao's methodology and key findings .
while the judiciary has made significant strides in improving its capital - planning process , most of the 12 projects listed on the 5-year plan are products of its former process .
in addition , we found in 2010 that recent federal courthouses had been constructed larger than necessary because of poor planning , oversight , and inefficient courtroom use .
current fiscal challenges also require that the federal government focus on essential projects .
impose a moratorium on projects on the current 5-year plan until amp evaluations are completed for them and then request feasibility studies for courthouse projects with the highest urgency scores that qualify for new construction under the amp process .
there is widespread agreement that the federal government faces formidable near - and long - term fiscal challenges .
this should include linking the amp process to the judiciary's strategic plan and developing and sharing with decision makers a long - term capital investment plan .
in the meantime , future 5- year plans should provide comprehensive information on new courthouse projects , including: a ) a summary of why each project qualifies for new construction and is more urgent than other projects , including information about how the amp process and other judiciary criteria for new courthouse construction were applied to the project ; b ) complete cost estimates of each project ; and c ) the alternatives to a new project that were considered , including courtroom - sharing , and why alternatives were deemed insufficient .
it is possible that some of the 12 projects do not reflect the most urgent capital investment needs of the judiciary under its current criteria .
