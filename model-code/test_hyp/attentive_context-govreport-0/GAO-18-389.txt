specifically , the act appropriated $394 million to cdc , $152 million to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , and $387 million to hhs's public health and social services emergency fund ( phssef ) , of which $386 million was allocated to additional hhs agencies — the biomedical advanced research and development authority ( barda ) within the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , and the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) .
this means that cdc will consider these approved applicants for future funding if an emergency occurs and funding becomes available .
in response to the outbreak , congress appropriated $932 million in september 2016 through the zika response and preparedness act to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and its agencies for activities such as responding to the zika virus , developing vaccines , and reimbursement for health care costs related to the zika virus .
the zika virus outbreak in 2015 affected individuals infected with the virus in ways that had not been seen with other infectious disease outbreaks .
agencies have until september 30 , 2022 , to disburse , or spend , the funding .
however , in this outbreak , the zika infection in pregnant women has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes: the virus can be passed to the fetus and cause a birth defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe brain defects , according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .
the agencies had until september 30 , 2017 , to obligate the funding , for example , by awarding a contract or a grant to an entity ( awardee ) .
in this report , we describe 1. the status of obligations and disbursements of zika supplemental funding by hhs agencies ; and 2. how selected awardees used their zika supplemental funding , and their experiences with applying for and managing the funding .
we interviewed officials from each agency to discuss the status of the agencies' obligations and disbursements of the zika supplemental funding , the different mechanisms used to award the funding , and the various factors that influenced the obligation and disbursement of the funding to awardees .
zika — a virus primarily transmitted through mosquito bites — can cause symptoms that include fever , rash , conjunctivitis ( red eyes ) , and joint and muscle pain , though many infected individuals do not have symptoms or will only experience mild symptoms .
to describe the status of obligations and disbursements of zika supplemental funding by hhs agencies , we analyzed barda , cdc , cms , hrsa , and nih obligation data as of september 30 , 2017 — the date funding had to be obligated — and disbursement data as of december 31 , 2017 — the first full quarter of data available at the time of our review .
