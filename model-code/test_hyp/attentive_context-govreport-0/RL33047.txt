the receipt of "gifts" by members and staff of the house of representatives and of the senate , including the receipt or acceptance of payment or reimbursement of travel expenses from outside , private , third - party sources , is generally restricted by the operation of federal statutory law , as applied by the house and senate rules .
the wording of the house and senate rules on this subject are substantially identical , other than as to the permissible duration of such trips , which is limited in the house to four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel ( excluding travel days ) , and in the senate to three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel ( also excluding travel days ) .
members and staff may generally not accept private gifts , reimbursements , or payments of their expenses , other than from their relatives and certain long - term personal friends , when the value of a gift is $50 or more ( or when multiple gifts of under $50 from the same source aggregate $100 or more in a calendar year ) .
there do exist exceptions to the gifts prohibitions under both house and senate rules which allow for the acceptance of some travel expenses from outside , third parties for what is characterized as "officially connected" travel by members , officers and employees of the house and senate in specifically defined and limited circumstances .
under these provisions , members of congress and congressional staff are prohibited from soliciting or accepting gifts from any private sources unless expressly permitted by an exception in the congressional rules .
the travel that has recently raised several questions has been the acceptance of private payment or reimbursement of "officially connected" travel by members and staff .
 ( b ) each advance authorization to accept reimbursement shall be signed by the member orofficer under whose direct supervision the employee works and shall include — ( 1 ) the name of the employee ; ( 2 ) the name of the person who will make the reimbursement ; ( 3 ) the time , place , and purpose of the travel ; and ( 4 ) a determination that the travel is in connection with the duties of the employee as an officeholder and would not create the appearance that the employee is using public office for private gain .
both the rules of the house of representatives and the rules of the senate expressly permit , as an exception to the general gifts restriction , the payment or reimbursement by certain outside , private sources of the "necessary" travel expenses of members for events such as conferences , fact - finding tours , symposia or lectures which , although not core congressional functions , are "in connection with" or sufficiently related to a member's official duties .
this report discusses the statutory and congressional rule structure under which members of the house and senate , under an exception to the gift rules , may generally accept from some private sources — other than registered lobbyists or registered foreign agents — necessary travel expenses , including transportation , food and lodging , for travel "in connection with" their official duties , such as for fact - finding trips , conferences or symposia , under certain circumstances and limitations .
