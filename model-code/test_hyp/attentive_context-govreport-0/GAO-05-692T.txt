i am pleased to be here today to discuss two recently issued gao reports that assess the securities and exchange commission's ( sec ) response to trading abuses uncovered in the mutual fund industry .
maintaining public confidence in the mutual fund industry is critical because about 95 million americans have invested more than $8 trillion in mutual funds , a significant share of the nation's privately held wealth .
as you know , trading abuses — including fraudulent market timing and late trading violations — were uncovered in many well - known companies in the mutual fund industry and raised significant concerns about the industry's ethical practices .
the federal regulators' failure to identify the abuses at an earlier stage has generated concern about the effectiveness of their examination and other oversight procedures .
before september 2003 , sec did not examine fund companies for market timing abuses because agency officials ( 1 ) viewed other activities as representing higher risks , ( 2 ) concluded that companies had financial incentives to control frequent trading because it could lower fund returns , and ( 3 ) were told by company officials that the companies had established controls over frequent trading .
sec has agreed to implement recommendations from our may 2005 report to strengthen these processes .
to address our reporting objectives , we conducted in - depth reviews of 11 sec enforcement actions against mutual fund companies for market timing and other abusive practices .
moreover , it is critical that sec and nasd have the capacity to identify abusive practices and to bring enforcement actions that punish violators and deter those who are contemplating similar abuses .
more specifically , my testimony covers ( 1 ) the reasons that sec did not detect the market timing abuses at an earlier stage and lessons learned from the agency not doing so , ( 2 ) the steps sec has taken to strengthen its oversight of the mutual fund industry and strengthen industry business practices , and ( 3 ) enforcement actions taken by sec and criminal prosecutors in response to these abuses and sec management procedures related to the making of criminal referrals and ensuring staff independence from the mutual fund industry .
questions have been raised as to why so many mutual fund companies and broker - dealers were able to engage in trading abuses , sometimes for years , without being detected by sec and nasd .
penalties that sec obtained in settling the 14 enforcement actions with investment advisers range from $2 million to $140 million , with an average penalty of about $56 million .
to improve its risk assessment capabilities , sec also has created and is currently staffing a new office to help the agency better anticipate , identify , and manage emerging risks and market trends .
second , sec can strengthen its capacity to identify and assess any evidence of potential risks .
in fact , the trading abuses only came to light after the new york state office of the attorney general ( nysoag ) received a tip from a hedge fund insider , conducted an investigation , and , in september 2003 , settled an enforcement action against a hedge fund company and a hedge fund official for market timing and late trading of several mutual funds .
