the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
111-148 , as amended ) requires health insurance exchanges ( also known as marketplaces ) to be established in every state .
aca exchanges are virtual marketplaces in which consumers and small businesses can shop for and purchase private health insurance coverage and , where applicable , be connected to public health insurance programs ( e.g. , medicaid ) .
they are not intended to supplant the private market outside of the exchanges but rather to provide an additional source of private health insurance coverage options .
it describes individual and small business eligibility and enrollment processes , provides enrollment estimates , explains the financial assistance available to certain consumers and small businesses , and discusses consumer enrollment assistance options .

a primary function of the exchanges is to provide a way for consumers and small businesses to compare and purchase health plan options offered by insurers .
states also can use other state funding to support their exchanges , and some have become ffes or moved to the federal it platform due to challenges and / or costs of maintaining their exchanges .
exchanges' other administrative activities include collecting enrollment and other data , reporting data to and otherwise interacting with the departments of hhs and the treasury , and working with state insurance departments and federal regulators to conduct ongoing oversight of plans .
it briefly addresses funding for the exchanges .
however , in the 2019 payment notice , hhs announced that the fees won't be assessed for issuers selling plans under the new model of reduced federal it support ( see " changes in shop exchange web portal functionality " in this report ) .
exchanges may generate funding to sustain their operations , including by assessing fees on participating health insurance plans .
the aca provided an indefinite ( i.e. , unspecified ) appropriation for hhs grants to states to support the planning and establishment of exchanges .
in addition to carrying out their consumer - facing activities that facilitate the purchase of coverage , exchanges are responsible for several administrative functions , including certifying the plans that will participate in their marketplaces .
