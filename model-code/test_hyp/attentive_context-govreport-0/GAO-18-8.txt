 ( recommendation 3 ) .
in january 2016 , the department of justice ( doj ) justice management division ( jmd ) completed a review of usms hiring and promotion policies and procedures and found several deficiencies .
 ( recommendation 2 ) develop and implement an agency - wide action plan to more fully understand and address areas where employees express negative perceptions of the merit promotion process .
between february 2015 and november 2016 more than 85 united states marshals service ( usms ) employees made allegations that usms officials engaged in improper promotion practices — such as routinely pre - selecting favored candidates and offering detail assignments to certain individuals based on non - merit factors — among others .
 ( recommendation 1 ) develop and implement a mechanism to provide specific feedback to employees on the results of the promotion process , including their readiness for promotion .
specifically , investigations in 2014 and 2015 found evidence of nepotism and employee misconduct .
in recent years , several internal and external investigations have substantiated several allegations .
we recommend that the director of the usms take the following actions: develop specific documented guidance — both for the current and new processes — to enhance raters' ability to consistently interpret and apply experience - based benchmarks for gs - 14 and gs - 15 positions and competency - based benchmarks for gs - 13 positions when evaluating candidate qualifications .
we reviewed all job vacancy announcements for fiscal years 2015 , 2016 , and part of fiscal year 2017 ( october 2016 through april 2017 ) to determine the extent to which usms has documented steps in accordance with office of personnel management ( opm ) requirements .
what steps , if any , has the usms taken to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion policies and processes ? .
more actively engaging employees could also bolster ongoing usms efforts to improve the promotion process and enhance agency performance .
for example , based on this review usms revised its scoring process to remove points awarded to candidates for service in an acting ( temporary promotion ) capacity .
jmd made recommendations to bring usms into compliance with applicable statutes , regulations , and policies .
in light of ongoing congressional questions , you asked us to assess the extent to which usms's promotion processes and policies ensure the selection of candidates based on merit as well as any effects that usms promotion practices may have on employee morale .
while the new competency assessment process has the potential to reduce the risk of rater conflicts of interest and bias , usms could still do more to further improve its process .
usms has taken limited steps to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion process .
since 2016 , usms has been implementing changes to its merit promotion process in response to multiple internal and external investigations , which substantiated allegations made by whistleblowers .
consistent with opm guidance in this area , the plan should specify time frames for accomplishing the actions , who will be responsible for implementing the actions , who will be affected by the actions , the resources required , and a plan to communicate these actions to managers and employees .
