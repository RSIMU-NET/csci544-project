the kingdom of saudi arabia's relations with the united states , its stability , and its future trajectory are subjects of continuing congressional interest .
u.s. - saudi security cooperation and u.s. concern for the continuing global availability of saudi energy supplies continue to anchor official bilateral relations as they have for decades .
in particular , saudi leadership transitions , trends in global oil prices , saudi budget pressures and reform plans , aggressive transnational terrorist threats , assertive saudi foreign policies , and saudi - iranian tensions have fueled recent congressional discussions .
in this context , the trump administration's efforts to reinvigorate u.s. - saudi relations have drawn increased public attention and have generated debate .
previously , the obama administration had differed with saudi leaders over iran , the iranian nuclear program , and conflicts in syria , iraq , and yemen .
from 2012 through 2016 , the obama administration notified congress of proposed foreign military sales to saudi arabia with a potential value of more than $45 billion .
amid some continuing differences on these issues , bilateral ties have been defined since 2017 by arms sale proposals , yemen - related security cooperation , and shared concerns about iran , al qaeda , and the islamic state organization ( is , aka isil / isis or the arabic acronym da'esh ) .
this package of previously discussed and newly proposed defense sales is intended to address saudi needs for maritime and coastal security improvements , air force training and support , cybersecurity and communications upgrades , missile and air defenses , and enhanced border security and counterterrorism capabilities ( see " arms sales , security assistance , and training " below and appendix b ) .
president donald trump and saudi officials announced agreement on some of these sales and others during the president's may 2017 trip to the kingdom , as part of a package that may potentially be worth more than $110 billion .
u.s. policy initiatives have long sought to help saudi leaders address economic and security challenges in ways consistent with u.s. interests .
u.s. support to the kingdom's operations in yemen and saudi use of u.s. - origin weaponry has drawn new attention to congressionally reviewed arms sales and questions of authorization .
the succession changes and crown prince mohammad bin salman's efforts to assert his role as the shaper of the kingdom's national security and economic policies have resulted in an apparent consolidation of authority under one individual and sub - branch of the family that is unprecedented in the kingdom since its founding .
president obama maintained u.s. logistical support for saudi operations in yemen but decided in 2016 to reduce u.s. personnel support and limit certain u.s. arms transfers .
shifts in saudi foreign policy toward a more assertive posture — typified by the kingdom's military operations in neighboring yemen and a series of regional moves intended to counteract iranian initiatives — have accompanied the post - 2015 leadership changes .
concerns about yemeni civilian deaths in saudi airstrikes , the operation's contribution to grave humanitarian conditions , and gains by al qaeda and islamic state supporters have led some members of congress and u.s. officials to urge all parties to seek a prompt settlement .
