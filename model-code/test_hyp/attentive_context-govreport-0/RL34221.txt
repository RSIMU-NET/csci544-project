proposed legislation in previous sessions of congress demonstrates legislative interest in the recently recognized phenomenon of patented tax strategies .
as discussion of tax strategy patents may continue in the 112 th congress , a review of this controversial category of patents is appropriate .
previously introduced , but unenacted legislation defined a "tax planning invention" as "a plan , strategy , technique , scheme , process , or system that is designed to reduce , minimize , determine , avoid , or defer , or has , when implemented , the effect of reducing , minimizing , determining , avoiding , or deferring , a taxpayer's tax liability or is designed to facilitate compliance with tax laws...." under the proposed legislation , such inventions would not have been patentable .
the proposed , but unenacted legislation would have stipulated that patents upon tax strategies could not be obtained .
still others believe that the patent system should not provide incentives for individuals to develop new ways to reduce their tax liability .
the report begins by providing an overview of both the practical workings and innovation policy aspirations of the patent system .
this report introduces the concept of tax strategy patents and reviews their implications for intellectual property and tax policy .
according to some experts , tax strategy patents may limit the ability of taxpayers to utilize provisions of the tax code , interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations .
however , "tax preparation software and other tools or systems used solely to prepare tax or information returns" were not subject to this ban .
tax strategy patents are the subject of a spirited debate .
further , several of them have been the subject of infringement litigation in the federal judicial system .
some of these applications have been approved as issued patents .
the report next reviews competing views about the impact of tax patents upon innovation policy .
in addition , some commentators believe that tax strategy patents present a positive development , potentially improving the public disclosure of tax shelters for the attention of congress and federal tax authorities .
some observers believe that such patents negatively impact social welfare .
legislation enacted in 1999 that accounted expressly for patents claiming "a method of doing or conducting business" arguably approved of such patents .
discussion of the recently appreciated phenomenon of tax strategy patents therefore appears to be timely .
others assert that tax strategy patents potentially complicate legal compliance by tax professionals and taxpayers alike .
it then provides a brief history of the phenomenon of tax strategy patents .
in furtherance of its oversight over the uspto , congress could continue to track that agency's activities with respect to tax strategy patents .
although views on tax strategy patents vary , evidence suggests that numerous applications that arguably cover tax planning methods have been filed at the uspto .
other commentators explain that patents on "business methods" have been obtained and enforced for many years .
although business method patents have been held to be patentable at least since the issuance of the state street bank opinion in 1998 , the more recent phenomenon of tax strategy patents has resulted in a spirited discussion .
