based on the congressional request letter of may 2005 and subsequent discussions with your staffs , we agreed to determine ( 1 ) what agencies have done to coordinate the implementation of the federal lands recreation enhancement act ( rea ) , including preparing for the new interagency federal lands pass ; ( 2 ) what agencies have done to implement the rea fee and amenity requirements and sufficiency of guidance for rea implementation ; ( 3 ) the extent to which the agencies have control and accounting procedures for collected recreation fee revenues ; ( 4 ) how participating agencies prioritize and approve activities and projects funded with fee revenues ; and ( 5 ) the extent to which units have unobligated fund balances and if recreational fees are being used to fund projects formerly funded with other appropriations .
over the past several years , congress has expressed concern about the operation and maintenance of federal recreation sites and the ability of federal land management agencies to continue providing visitors high - quality recreational opportunities , while at the same time protecting natural and other resources .
this guidance for implementing such controls should identify and encourage the use of best practices , such as routine audits .
in order to improve the forest service's implementation of the federal lands recreation enhancement act and improve the accountability and controls for collected recreation fees , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture direct the chief of the forest service to take the following two actions: promptly issue final regulations and implementing guidance on the fee program , including detailed policy and procedure guidance ; and ascertain the extent to which its units do not have effective processes and procedures for accounting for and controlling collected fees and develop guidance for implementing appropriate and effective internal controls over cash management .
to help address these concerns , congress passed legislation in 1996 authorizing an experimental initiative called the recreational fee demonstration program ( fee demo ) , under which participating agencies were authorized to establish and collect recreation fees at a number of sites and to use the revenues to enhance visitor services , manage and protect resources , and reduce maintenance backlogs , among other uses .
agencies participating in the fee demo program included the department of the interior's ( doi ) bureau of land management ( blm ) , fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , and the national park service ( nps ) , as well as the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) forest service ( fs ) .
as requested , we determined ( 1 ) what agencies have done to coordinate the implementation of rea , including preparing for the new interagency federal lands pass ; ( 2 ) what agencies have done to implement rea fee and amenity requirements and sufficiency of guidance for rea implementation ; ( 3 ) the extent to which the agencies have control and accounting procedures for collected recreation fee revenues ; ( 4 ) how participating agencies prioritize and approve activities and projects funded with fee revenues ; and ( 5 ) the extent to which units have unobligated fund balances and if recreational fees are being used to fund projects formerly funded with other appropriations .
