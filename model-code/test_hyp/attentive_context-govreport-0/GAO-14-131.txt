the public works and economic development act of 1965 ( pweda ) authorized the creation of the economic development administration ( eda ) within the department of commerce ( commerce ) .
this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which eda documented grant selection decisions ; ( 2 ) the indicators of economic distress for counties with eda - funded projects and how these funds have been distributed to rural and nonrural areas ; and ( 3 ) the types of projects that have been funded by these programs .
the two largest programs eda uses to accomplish its mission are the public works and economic development ( public works ) program and the economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) program .
in fiscal year 2012 , public works projects comprised 48 percent ( $129.2 million ) of eda's total grant investment dollars , while eaa projects comprised 14 percent ( $38.5 million ) of eda's total grant investment dollars .
pweda , as amended , authorizes eda to provide financial assistance through grants to rural and urban communities experiencing substantial and persistent economic distress .
this report examines , for the economic development administration's ( eda ) public works and economic development ( public works ) and economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) programs , ( 1 ) the extent to which eda documented grant selection decisions ; ( 2 ) the indicators of economic distress for counties with eda - funded projects and how these funds have been distributed to rural and nonrural areas ; and ( 3 ) the types of projects that have been funded by these programs .
to increase transparency in the award selection process , the secretary of commerce should direct the deputy assistant secretary for economic development to develop and implement procedures to ensure that eda regional offices consistently complete the required investment review committee record template for each proposed project considered for funding .
eda awarded more than 1,500 grants under the public works and eaa grant programs in fiscal years 2006 through 2012 ( the period of interest in the congressional mandate ) .
because eda officials have not ensured that its regional offices fully and consistently document their irc discussions in the template , eda may not have adequate assurance that its funding decisions are consistent and transparent .
eda guidance notes that the irc should address several items using the template , including the ( 1 ) pros and cons of each project ; ( 2 ) environmental / legal issues , if any ; ( 3 ) project's fit with the agency's investment priorities ; ( 4 ) notes on the reasonableness of reported outcome data on jobs and private investment ; and ( 5 ) recommendations for further action .
business development ( projects that support entrepreneurial efforts , help businesses get started , and promote the development of new markets for existing products ) ; and plans and research ( planning and strategy development efforts for job creation and retention and projects that support research of practices , principles , and innovations that foster effective economic development strategies ) .
we provided a draft of this report to the department of commerce ( commerce ) for review and comment .
