as you requested , this report examines the changes in ( 1 ) airfares and ( 2 ) the quantity , quality , and safety of air service since the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 .
specifically , the report compares data on these issues for airports serving small , medium - sized , and large communities .
in 1994 , these airports accounted for 4.7 million ( 66 percent ) of the 7.1 million domestic airline departures and 320.6 million ( 67 percent ) of the 481.7 million domestic airline enplanements in the united states .
they also estimated that because of the ( 1 ) increased number of flights , ( 2 ) efficiencies of the hub - and - spoke networks in connecting smaller communities to the overall aviation system , and ( 3 ) resulting savings in travel time , passengers save an additional $10.3 billion a year as a result of deregulation .
extensive research has also been conducted on the impact of deregulation on air safety .
nevertheless , research has been inconclusive to date on whether the increased presence of commuter airlines and turboprops has resulted in more accidents at airports serving small communities .
this body of work commonly acknowledges that since deregulation , the rate of accidents has continued its historic decline .
before 1978 , the u.s. airline industry was tightly regulated .
in addition , expressing concern that deregulation may have adversely affected small and medium - sized communities to the extent that airlines eliminated service or replaced jets with turboprops and noting that opinions differed on this subject , the chairman requested that we compare the changes in the quantity , quality , and safety of air service since deregulation for airports serving small , medium - sized , and large communities .
studies by dot and others have differed in their conclusions about deregulation's impact on airline service and safety .
the act phased out the government's control of fares and service but did not change the government's role in regulating and overseeing air safety .
nevertheless , others have come to different conclusions , holding that deregulation has prevented further gains in safety because the increased competitive pressures brought by deregulation have forced airlines to limit spending on maintenance .
concerned that government regulation had made the industry inefficient , inhibited its growth , and caused airfares to be too high in many heavily traveled markets involving the nation's largest communities , the congress passed the airline deregulation act of 1978 .
many of these researchers also believe that for smaller communities , air safety has decreased since deregulation because substituting commuter carriers and turboprops , which have higher accident rates , for larger airlines and jet aircraft at these airports has increased those communities' accident risk .
while other studies generally agree that fares have decreased since deregulation , they point out that the lower fares may have been achieved at the cost of reduced service quantity and quality for many smaller and medium - sized communities and that therefore the overall net benefits of deregulation are less clear .
for example , morrison and winston estimated that the lower fares since deregulation save passengers $12.4 billion annually .
