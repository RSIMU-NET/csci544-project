over the past decade , however , the united states has worked closely with the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) to make third country resettlement a viable , durable solution for increasing numbers from a broader representation of the world's refugee population , which currently stands at over 10 million .
to help inform possible future efforts to reform the refugee resettlement assistance system , this report discusses existing resettlement assistance programs , key issues and challenges in providing effective assistance , and policy options to reform the current system .
the obama administration has initiated an interagency review of refugee resettlement , which is being lead by the national security council ( nsc ) .
many of the resettled refugees had family members already in the united states .
in the early years of the [refugee] program , large numbers of relatively few nationalities located in a limited number of countries dominated the program .
a set of refugee resettlement assistance programs , administered by the office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) in the department of health and human services' administration for children and families ( hhs / acf ) , provides transitional assistance to refugees and other designated groups .
it remains unclear whether the administration will take additional steps to reform the system and / or whether congress will pursue reform through legislation .
achievement of self - sufficiency has been more difficult in recent years in the face of the economic recession .
this excerpt , from the interagency report proposed refugee admissions for fy201 1 , suggests the extent of the challenge facing the u.s. government as it resettles a diverse group of individuals with a wide range of needs .
these programs are intended to help the beneficiaries ( who are referred to collectively as "refugees" in this report ) achieve economic self - sufficiency as soon as possible after their arrival in the united states .
they have been widely anticipated , however , and may further energize reform efforts .
the admission of refugees to the united states and their resettlement here are authorized by the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , as amended by the refugee act of 1980 .
the administration has worked closely with the congress to invest the resources necessary to reach smaller numbers of the most desperate populations who find themselves in seemingly forgotten locations .
while the refugee admissions process is briefly described and referenced in parts of this report , as relevant , the focus of this report is on resettlement assistance to refugees in the united states .
it is not known when the results of the review will be made available .
separate from the orr program , the department of state ( dos ) administers a program of initial resettlement for newly arriving refugees known as the reception and placement program .
while we have again resettled large numbers of iraqis , burmese , and bhutanese this year , the usrap has admitted refugees from over 60 nationalities who were processed in some 90 countries .
it may be that the results of the nsc - led interagency review mentioned in the introduction will help galvanize support for a particular set of reforms .
