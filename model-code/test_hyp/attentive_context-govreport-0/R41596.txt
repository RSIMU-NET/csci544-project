there has been increased concern over the size and sustainability of the united states' recent deficits and the country's long - run budget outlook .
this concern has brought the issues of the federal government's revenue needs and fundamental reform of the tax system to the forefront of congressional debates .
one place congress may turn to address these issues is the set of tax benefits for homeowners .
the goals of this report are five - fold: ( 1 ) briefly summarize the trends in homeownership ; ( 2 ) provide an overview of what tax benefits are available ; ( 3 ) analyze the rationales commonly provided for offering such benefits ; ( 4 ) analyze the effect of the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction on the homeownership rate , housing consumption , and the economy ; and ( 5 ) present policy options .
the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) has estimated that the cost to the federal government in terms of foregone revenue from these benefits will be approximately $136.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2017 .
economists have identified the set of tax benefits for homeowners as one area in which reform may improve economic efficiency .
this report focuses on the two largest federal tax benefits available to homeowners â€” the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for state and local property taxes .
the three most expensive tax incentives in the jct's estimate are the mortgage interest deduction ( $77.3 billion annually ) , the itemized state and local property tax deduction ( $31.5 billion annually ) , and the exclusion of capital gains on the sale of a principal residence ( $26.5 billion annually ) .
the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) estimates these benefits will cost the federal government an average of $136.3 billion in foregone revenue annually between 2013 and 2017 .
the exclusion of capital gains is not reviewed in detail because its effects on the housing decisions of taxpayers is fundamentally different than the effects of the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes .
and how does subsidizing owner - occupied housing affect the performance of the overall economy ? .
these long - term trends in homeownership behavior may be overshadowed by more recent trends in foreclosures .
this trend can have important ramifications in terms of land use , energy use , transportation , and affordability .
and lastly , homeownership may have a positive effect on living conditions , which can lead to a healthier population .
at the beginning of 2001 , near the start of the housing boom , the national foreclosure rate on all mortgage loans was 1.24% .
until recently , the homeownership rate in this country had generally increased over time .
after peaking in late 2009 and early 2010 , the foreclosure rate has gradually decreased .
by 1950 , the homeownership rate had increased to 55% , and to 67.4% by 2000 .
second , homeownership may promote a more even distribution of income and wealth , as well as establish greater individual financial security .
by the fourth quarter of 2013 the foreclosure rate on all loans stood at 2.86% , while foreclosures occurring among subprime borrowers stood at 10.43% .
