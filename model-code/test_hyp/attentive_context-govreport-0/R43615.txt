social security's minimum benefit provision , the special minimum primary insurance amount ( pia ) , is an alternative benefit formula that increases benefits paid to workers who had low earnings for many years and to their dependents and survivors .
in 2017 , about 39,347 ( or about 0.6% ) of the 62 million social security recipients qualified for the minimum benefit .
unlike the standard social security benefit formula , which is based on a worker's average lifetime earnings , the special minimum pia is based on the number of years a person has worked .
because of the way regular social security benefits and the special minimum pia are computed , the number of recipients who qualify for the special minimum pia has been decreasing .
to be eligible for a social security retired - worker benefit , a worker generally needs 40 earnings credits ( also called quarters of coverage ) .
beneficiaries receive the higher of the two amounts .
it then presents arguments for and against expanding the special minimum pia , discusses elements to be considered in proposals for change , and describes some specific options for increasing benefits paid to people with low earnings or low income .
the primary insurance amoun t ( pia ) is the benefit a worker would receive if the worker elects to begin receiving retirement benefits at the worker's full retirement age ( fra , sometimes called the normal retirement age ) .
after 1999 , the provision has benefited only newly entitled beneficiaries whose regular benefit is subject to the wep ( see figure 2 ) .
as table 2 shows , almost 73% of the affected beneficiaries were workers and about 19% were widow ( er ) s. spouses and child beneficiaries accounted for the remainder .
in 2018 , a worker earns one credit for each $1,320 of covered earnings ( i.e. , earnings subject to social security payroll taxes ) , up to a maximum of four credits for covered earnings of $5,280 or more .
the difference between the regular pia and the special minimum pia for a low earner with 30 years of coverage has declined , with an estimated difference of $4 for a worker becoming eligible in 2010 ( see figure 3 ) .
this report explains how the special minimum pia functions under current law and provides some historical background on minimum benefit provisions in the social security act .
ssa's office of the chief actuary , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and ssa's office of retirement policy have all published detailed analyses of the effects of various minimum benefit options .
some proposals would address poverty among long - term , low - wage workers and their dependents by targeting benefit increases to single or divorced women or to people who live into advanced old age .
the social security administration projects that the provision will have no effect on people turning 62 years old in 2019 or later .
the estimates of the impact the special minimum pia has on monthly benefits show that in june 2013 , the special minimum pia increased average benefits of those affected by the provision by an average of $46 per month ( see table 2 ) .
