recent congressional interest in u.s. energy policy has focused in part on ways through which the united states could secure more economical and reliable petroleum resources both domestically and internationally .
canadian oil sands account for about 54% of canada's total crude oil production , and that number is expected to rise from its current level of 1.9 million barrels per day ( mbd ) in 2013 to 4.8 mbd by 2030 .
many forecasters identify petroleum products refined from canadian oil sands as one possible solution .
these impacts may include increased water and natural gas use , disturbance of mined land , effects on wildlife and water quality , trans - boundary air pollution , and emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghg ) during extraction and processing .
increased production from canadian oil sands , however , is not without controversy , as many have expressed concern over the potential environmental impacts .
while ghg emissions and other air quality issues originating in the upstream sectors of canada's petroleum industry may not directly impact u.s. national emissions inventories or u.s. ghg reporting per se , many environmental stakeholders and policy makers have noted that the increased use of more emission - intensive resources in the united states may have negative consequences for both u.s. and global energy and environmental policy .
further , the infrastructure to produce , upgrade , refine , and transport the resource from canadian oil sands reserves to the united states is in place , and additional infrastructure projects — such as the keystone xl pipeline — have been proposed .
the u.s. department of state ( dos ) , in response to comments on the 2010 draft supplementary environmental impact statement ( 2010 draft eis ) for the keystone xl pipeline project ( which would connect oil sands production facilities in the western canadian sedimentary basin with refinery facilities in the united states ) , commissioned a contractor to analyze the life - cycle ghg emissions associated with these resources in comparison to other reference crudes .
life - cycle assessment ( lca ) is an analytic method used for evaluating and comparing the environmental impacts of various products ( in this case , the climate change implications of hydrocarbon resources ) .
161.12 ) nor executive orders 13337 and 12114 ( environmental effects abroad of major federal activities ) legally require that an eis include an assessment of environmental activities outside the united states .
in this way , lca can serve to direct policy makers' attention to those areas in resource development that present the greatest challenges to ghg emissions control , and hence , the biggest potential benefits if adequately managed .
in accordance with this process , dos released a revised draft supplementary eis ( draft eis ) for the revised project on march 1 , 2013 , and a revised final supplementary eis ( final eis ) on january 31 , 2014 , including an assessment of the indirect cumulative impacts and life - cycle ghg emissions of canadian oil sands crudes .
they contend that the lack of transport infrastructure and the price discount it occasions has already affected production of the oil sands and , if continued , would further depress investment and development in the region .
