over the past decade , we and others have raised concerns about the adequacy of security at nuclear weapons facilities within the department of energy ( doe ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) — a separately organized agency within doe .
our followup report will focus on the extent to which physical security has improved ; the effectiveness of the process for establishing safeguards and security requirements following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks ; and the remaining vulnerabilities .
in order to strengthen the safeguards and security program of the nuclear weapons complex , we recommend that the nnsa administrator and secretary of energy formalize the roles and responsibilities of site offices and headquarters for conducting oversight ; ensure that sites are performing oversight using a survey approach that provides an integrated comprehensive view of security conditions and is consistent with doe orders ; ensure that contractors' corrective action plans are prepared and documented consistently and are based on qualitative root - cause , risk - assessment , and cost - benefit analyses , and that appropriate incentives are used to help motivate contractors toward effectively addressing findings ; and develop and implement a plan to ensure that nnsa allocates safeguards and security staff so that it provides effective safeguards and security oversight over the long term .
for example , we reported in 2002 that doe had not addressed problems in implementing security initiatives , while an independent study by the commission on science and security , conducted at the request of doe , found deficiencies in cyber security .
finally , to provide effective oversight , nnsa needs to develop an approach , beyond its “virtual” organization , that ensures its limited security resources are able to provide oversight , over the long term , where and when it is needed .
concerns over security within the nuclear weapons complex were brought into sharper focus by the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
nnsa relies upon its safeguards and security program to ensure the physical security of the nation's nuclear weapons complex .
nnsa is responsible for ensuring that its contractors' security activities are effective and conform to doe's orders and policy requirements .
nnsa has not been fully effective in managing its safeguards and security program in four key areas , and therefore , it cannot be assured that its contractors are working to maximum advantage to protect its sites .
we have modified our recommendation to target this specific long - term concern .
these processes include , among other things , ( 1 ) annual , comprehensive surveys conducted by subject matter experts from across the complex and ( 2 ) ongoing reviews of one or more aspects of contractors' program ( surveillance ) by nnsa site officials .
rather , our objective was to assess the way nnsa manages its overall security program .
first , nnsa has not fully defined safeguards and security roles and responsibilities .
nnsa continues to change its management structure , making it difficult to define roles and responsibilities clearly .
consistency problems are likely to continue without effective nnsa guidance for corrective actions .
the lack of qualitative performance measures affects the quality of the correction plan .
