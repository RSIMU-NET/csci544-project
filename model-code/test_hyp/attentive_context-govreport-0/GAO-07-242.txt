the objectives of this report were to ( 1 ) describe trends in the financial condition of banks and thrifts and federal regulators' oversight of these institutions since the passage of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 ( fdicia ) , ( 2 ) evaluate how federal regulators used the capital or prompt corrective action ( pca ) provisions of fdicia to resolve capital adequacy issues at the institutions they regulate , ( 3 ) evaluate the extent to which federal regulators use the noncapital provisions of fdicia to identify and address weaknesses at the institutions they regulate , and ( 4 ) describe the federal deposit insurance corporation's ( fdic ) deposit insurance system and how recent changes to the system affect the determination of depository institutions' risk and insurance premiums .
in response to the federal banking regulators' failure to take appropriate action , congress passed the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 ( fdicia ) , implementing significant changes to the way banking regulators supervise the nation's depository institutions .
specifically , this report ( 1 ) describes trends in the financial condition of banks and thrifts and federal regulators' oversight of these institutions since the passage of fdicia , ( 2 ) evaluates how federal regulators have used pca to resolve capital adequacy issues at the institutions they regulate , ( 3 ) evaluates the extent to which federal regulators have used the noncapital supervisory actions of sections 38 and 39 to address weaknesses at the institutions they regulate , and ( 4 ) describes fdic's deposit insurance system and how recent changes to the system affect the determination of institutions' risk and insurance premiums .
with the failure of more than 2,900 federally insured banks and thrifts in the 1980s and early 1990s , federal regulators were criticized for failing to take timely and forceful action to address the causes of these failures and prevent losses to the deposit insurance fund and taxpayers .
the federal reserve noted that pca has substantively enhanced the agency's authority to resolve serious problems expeditiously and that pca has generally worked effectively in the problem situations where its use became applicable .
our review focused on fdic , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) , the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) , and the office of thrift supervision ( ots ) and was limited to depository institutions .
fdic issued its final rule implementing changes in november 2006 .
to address these objectives , we reviewed relevant laws , regulations , and regulators' policies and procedures and interviewed officials from the four federal banking regulators — fdic , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) , the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) , and the office of thrift supervision ( ots ) — as well as industry officials and academics .
fdicia created two new sections in the federal deposit insurance act ( fdia ) — sections 38 and 39 — that required the federal banking regulators to create a two - part framework to supplement their existing supervisory authority to address capital deficiencies and unsafe or unsound conduct , practices , or conditions .
