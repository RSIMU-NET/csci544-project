this sweeping piece of legislation was enacted just 10 months ago , but it has already produced major changes in the nation's approach to maritime security .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the implementation of the maritime transportation security act ( mtsa ) of 2002 .
at your request , we have begun reviewing the implementation of security provisions of title i of mtsa .
our information is based on interviews with agency officials charged with implementing mtsa's provisions , as well as with officials and stakeholders from several ports .
we will be continuing our efforts to more fully evaluate a number of the issues i will address today , and we plan to issue a report when this work is complete .
i am here today to tell you about our preliminary findings and what agencies within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and other federal departments are doing to fulfill their many responsibilities under the act .
mtsa called for actions in 46 key areas we identified , such as creating a maritime intelligence security system , assessing security conditions in port areas , creating and implementing a vessel tracking system , and creating identification systems for port workers and seafarers .
also , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is testing new identification cards for controlling access to secure transportation facilities , including vessels and port facilities .
i also want to advise you about specific matters that agency officials or others have brought to our attention thus far and other issues that may require further oversight .
further work will be needed to determine the extent to which early progress will be sustained over the course of implementation efforts and whether the spirit of cooperation translates into efforts at the port level .
the bureau of customs and border protection ( bcbp ) and the maritime administration ( marad ) , the two other agencies with the largest set of responsibilities under mtsa , also are making progress on major projects .
our preliminary findings are as follows: progress has been made in implementing mtsa .
all six coast guard maritime safety and security teams included in the fiscal year 2003 budget are expected to be operational by the end of september 2003 ; these teams are designed to provide increased protection against terrorism in and around the nation's harbors .
while the coast guard is implementing this system , more than half of the 25 busiest u.s. ports will not have it for the foreseeable future , because it requires extensive shore - based equipment and infrastructure that many ports do not have .
the two remaining areas relate primarily to operational or efficiency matters , such as duplication of effort in collecting intelligence information .
for example , the coast guard , which had lead responsibility for most of the assignments , has six interim rules in place covering major areas of responsibility , such as security in and around the ports , aboard individual vessels , and at individual facilities .
the coast guard developed a system that would allow port officials and personnel on other vessels to determine the identity and position of vessels entering or operating within the port .
three of these areas , as shown in table 1 , primarily have security implications .
