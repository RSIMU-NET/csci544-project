postal service's ( usps ) cost structure has become unsustainable in part because its declining revenue is insufficient to cover the costs of operating usps's vast network of post offices and mail - processing centers .
for example , by considering factors , such as the distance of cpus to existing post offices , cpu hours and days of service , and usps's costs of compensating cpus , usps could better inform its retail strategy in order to make better strategic use of cpus in its future retail network , which will likely include reduced hours at thousands of post offices .
usps reached its statutory $15 billion borrowing limit in september , 2012 , and usps's cash resources are so low that it is unable to meet all of its retiree health care prefunding obligations .
over the past year , gao has issued a series of reports examining how aspects of usps's current operations and financial obligations affect its costs and financial condition .
the role of cpus is also addressed in postal reform legislation pending in both chambers of congress .
usps provided a written response ( see appendix iii ) in which they discussed usps's efforts beyond cpus to provide customers with sufficient and convenient access to its products and services through other types of partnerships and alternatives to post offices .
to determine how contract postal units ( cpus ) supplement the u.s .
usps revenue from cpus and compensation to them from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 , and 3. challenges usps might face if it increases its use of cpus .
to reverse this course , usps has stated that it must better align its operational network with the realities of declining mail volume through a number of actions , including reducing the costs of operating post offices .
a bill passed by the house of representatives committee on oversight and government reform would prohibit appeals of certain post office closures when a cpu is located within 2 miles .
this report addresses usps's use of contract postal units ( cpus ) — independent retailers that , under contract with usps , provide customers with a broad range of the same products and services as post offices at the same prices , but at a potentially lower cost to usps .
as usps continues to develop this retail strategy , we believe that usps can capitalize on growing acceptance of retail alternatives by using information about cpus to inform its decisions .
we continue to believe , as we stated in november 2011 , that it is important that such a strategy discuss how usps plans to increase its use of retail alternatives — including cpus — while considering significant changes to its network of post offices and the means through which it provides access to usps's customers .
given the retail service decisions facing usps and the potential usps reforms that congress is considering , you asked us to provide you with information on cpus .
our past work has shown that replacing postal - owned and - operated facilities with privately owned and operated facilities is a strategy some foreign posts have used to restructure their retail networks to reduce facility and labor costs .
