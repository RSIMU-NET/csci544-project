two political parties â€” the people's national party ( pnp ) and the jamaica labour party ( jlp ) have dominated the political system since before the country's 1962 independence .
an english - speaking caribbean nation with a population of about 2.8 million , jamaica has had a relatively stable parliamentary political system stemming from its history of british colonial rule , even though extensive political violence often marred national elections in the 1970s and 1980s .
in the 1970s and 1980s , the two parties had distinct ideological differences , with the pnp under michael manley ( 1972-1980 ) espousing democratic socialism and increasing state ownership of the economy , and the jlp under edward seaga ( 1980-1989 ) adopting a policy of economic liberalization and privatization .
when michael manley returned to power in 1989 , however , his pnp government did not roll back the jlp's pro - business polices , but instead adopted a similar approach .
while the jamaican government increased its enforcement activity and public awareness efforts in 2009 , the united states urges it to reform its patent protection law in accordance with international standards .
since that time , there have been few ideological differences between the two parties .
security assistance to jamaica has included support to assist jamaica with port and border security measures and to increase the counternarcotics and counterterrorism capabilities of the jamaican security forces and their capability to protect jamaican waters .
usaid work in jamaica in recent years has focused on five program areas: 1 ) economic growth , including efforts to promote free market policies and improve worker skills ; 2 ) rural development , with efforts focused on agribusiness , eco - tourism , and cottage industries that help preserve jamaica's biodiversity ; 3 ) health , especially projects supporting hiv / aids activities ; 4 ) democracy , including efforts to help underserved communities beset with violent crime and to improve community policing initiatives ; and 5 ) education , with efforts to improve literacy and other skills and to support the regional caribbean center for excellence in teacher training ( c - cett ) that supports education in eight caribbean countries .
patterson of the pnp , who took over as prime minister when manley resigned in 1992 for health reasons , won three elections and served as head of government until his retirement in march 2006 .
both the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) and the peace corps have provided assistance to jamaica since its independence in 1962 .
the jlp ran on an anti - crime and anti - corruption platform , but the golding government has continued to face challenges in both areas .
most of this aid was development assistance ( da ) and economic support funds ( esf ) for usaid to implement a variety of development projects .
according to the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) , jamaica's delay in enacting legislation to implement patent protection obligations under the world trade organization trade - related aspects of intellectual property agreement and the u.s. - jamaica bilateral intellectual property agreement remains a u.s. concern .
but in the aftermath of the jamaican government's efforts to capture coke and extradite him to the united states in late june 2010 , u.s. officials commended the golding government for its efforts .
