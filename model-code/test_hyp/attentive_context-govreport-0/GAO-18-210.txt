our objectives were to ( 1 ) identify the major entities that collect , store , and process medicare beneficiary data and that connect with centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) systems and networks ; ( 2 ) determine whether requirements for the protection of medicare beneficiary data align with federal guidance ; and ( 3 ) assess the programs cms has in place to oversee the implementation of security protections for medicare beneficiary data .

the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is the agency responsible for overseeing the medicare program , which covers nearly 58 million aged and disabled americans , who represent approximately 18 percent of the total u.s. population .
federal program spending for medicare benefits totaled approximately $696 billion for fiscal year 2016 .
 ( recommendation 2 ) develop processes and procedures to ensure that qualified entities and researchers have implemented information security controls effectively throughout their agreements with cms .
recent data breaches at hospitals , insurance companies , and other entities in the health care industry have highlighted the importance of ensuring the security of health information , including personally identifiable information ( pii ) , about medicare beneficiaries .
if fully and effectively implemented , the intended actions should help hhs to address weaknesses in processes and procedures for ensuring the protection of medicare beneficiary data used by the department's contractors .
 ( recommendation 1 ) develop processes and procedures to ensure that findings from all mac assessments are classified consistently and tracked appropriately .
without more effective oversight programs in place , cms lacks full assurance that external entities are appropriately implementing security protections for medicare beneficiary data .
we are making three recommendations to the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services: develop and distribute guidance for researchers defining minimum security controls and implementation guidance for those controls that is consistent with nist guidance .
further , cms has not established an oversight program for qualified entities and researchers to assess whether they are implementing security controls as they are required .
until cms provides more comprehensive , risk - based guidance on implementing security controls to all of its external partners , there is an increased risk that researchers will not fully implement appropriate protections for medicare beneficiary data .
while cms has established assessment programs for macs , the agency has much more limited security oversight mechanisms in place to ensure that qualified entities and researchers with access to medicare beneficiary data implement appropriate security controls .
these include researching and monitoring the efficacy of health care treatments , payments , and analyzing the cost of health care treatments .
medicare beneficiary data are created , stored , and used by a wide variety of entities , such as health care providers , insurance companies , financial institutions , academic researchers , and other federal / state agencies for a wide variety of purposes .
