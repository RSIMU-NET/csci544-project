 ( recommendation 3 ) .
since the 1970s , the federal transit administration's ( fta ) capital investment grants program has been the primary source of federal financial assistance to new “fixed - guideway” projects or extensions to existing fixed - guideway systems across the united states .
the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) , enacted in 2012 , included a provision for us to biennially review fta's processes and procedures for evaluating and rating projects seeking funding through the capital investment grants program .
however , we also reported that the fixing america's surface transportation act ( fast act ) , enacted in 2015 , contained new provisions for fta to address .
program funding is provided through the annual appropriations process , and over the last 10 fiscal years fta has awarded over $19 billion to cities , states , and other localities across the country .
fta's progress in addressing outstanding statutory provisions as amended by map - 21 and the fast act , and how fta's evaluation and rating process enables it to verify that statutory requirements are met before recommending a core capacity project for funding .
we reported that fta was taking steps to implement map - 21 , such as by implementing a provision directing fta to issue policy guidance outlining the review and evaluation process for new fixed - guideway projects and core capacity improvement projects ( hereafter core capacity projects ) , and reported that fta intended to take action to address other provisions over the next few years .
we also reviewed fta's policy guidance ; other pertinent agency documents , such as fta's instructions for applying to the program , its templates for evaluating and rating projects in the program , and its annual reports to congress with funding recommendations ; and prior gao reports .
however , in march 2018 the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 , provided the program with more than $2.6 billion , and required fta to continue to administer the capital investment grants program in accordance with the program's procedural and substantive requirements .
in april 2016 , we issued our most recent report in response to the provision , focusing on fta's efforts in implementing changes that map - 21 made to the program's processes , changes that were aimed at expediting project delivery .
projects that compete for funding through this program are planned and implemented locally , and include capital investments in heavy and light rail , commuter rail , streetcars , and ferries as well as bus rapid transit .
fta evaluates and rates projects seeking funding through this program based on statutory criteria , recommends to congress which projects to fund , and awards funding to projects .
consequently , fta recommended that congress limit future funding for the capital investment grants program .
in conducting this review , we focused on reviewing fta's progress addressing statutory provisions that were outstanding at the time of our previous biennial review as well as the evaluation and rating requirements specified in statute for core capacity projects .
by not addressing those provisions , fta runs the risk of failing to implement provisions of federal law , and the federal government or project sponsors may be missing opportunities to deliver transit projects more efficiently .
