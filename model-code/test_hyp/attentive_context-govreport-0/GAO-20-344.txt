the total improper payment estimates for programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years decreased for fiscal 2017 primarily because the medicare fee - for - service program , with about $41 billion of improper payments in fiscal year 2016 , was reported as compliant beginning fiscal year 2017 .
this report ( 1 ) summarizes federal agencies' reported improper payment estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 , and the reasons they identified for substantial changes between years , and ( 2 ) discusses the extent to which chief financial officers act of 1990 ( cfo act ) agencies complied with the six ipera criteria for fiscal year 2018 , and overall ipera compliance trends evident for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 , as reported by their igs .
the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 2010 ( ipera ) , among other things , requires federal agencies' inspectors general ( ig ) to annually determine and report on whether the agencies under their jurisdiction have complied with ipera criteria .
the reported improper payment estimates for these programs totaled about $109 billion for fiscal year 2016 , $74 billion for fiscal year 2017 , and $78 billion for fiscal year 2018 .
improper payments have been estimated to total almost $1.7 trillion government - wide from fiscal years 2003 through 2019 .
to summarize federal agencies' improper payment estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 , we compiled improper payment estimates from agency financial reports ( afr ) or performance and accountability reports ( par ) and the office of management and budget's ( omb ) paymentaccuracy.gov website .
igs' annual ipera compliance reports help reasonably ensure that improper payment estimates are accurate , reliable , and complete and that congress has information on agencies' efforts to address improper payments .
from fiscal years 2003 through 2016 , a government - wide improper payment estimate and rate had been included in the government - wide financial reports based on the programs and activities that reported estimates .
we performed our work under the authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations on his own initiative and to assist congress with its oversight responsibilities .
for such changes , we reviewed the agency's afr and par to determine the reason ( s ) , if any , that the agency identified .
improper payments — payments that should not have been made or that were made in incorrect amounts — continue to be an area of fiscal concern in the federal government .
however , government - wide financial reports for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 did not include a government - wide improper payment estimate or improper payment rate .
as shown in figure 1 , of the $175 billion for fiscal year 2019 , about $121 billion ( approximately 69 percent ) is concentrated in three program areas: ( 1 ) medicaid , totaling about $57.4 billion ( approximately 32.8 percent ) ; ( 2 ) medicare ( comprised of three reported programs: fee - for - service ( parts a and b ) , advantage ( part c ) , and prescription drug ( part d ) ) , totaling about $46.2 billion ( approximately 26.5 percent ) ; and ( 3 ) earned income tax credit ( eitc ) , totaling about $17.4 billion ( approximately 9.9 percent ) .
