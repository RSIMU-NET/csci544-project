data from the census — a constitutionally mandated effort — are used to apportion seats in the congress , redraw congressional districts , help allocate more than $400 billion in federal aid to state and local governments , and redraw local political boundaries .
group quarters consist of college dormitories , prisons , nursing homes , and other facilities typically owned or managed by an entity providing housing , services , or both for the residents .
as requested , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which the bureau has strengthened its procedures for counting group quarters compared to the 2000 census and ( 2 ) particular challenges and opportunities for an accurate group quarters count in brooklyn .
i am pleased to be here today at the brooklyn borough hall to discuss the u.s. census bureau's ( bureau ) efforts to conduct an accurate count of people living in dwellings known as group quarters as part of the 2010 census .
thus , for brooklyn , as with all localities , an incomplete count could have implications for political representation and getting its fair share of federal assistance .
my testimony today is based on our completed and ongoing reviews of the bureau's efforts to build an accurate address list , including address canvassing , where temporary census employees go door - to - door verifying addresses , and an initial group quarters operation called group quarters validation , where the bureau determines whether an address is either a group quarters or conventional housing unit .
brooklyn's range of group quarters — including colleges , hospitals , convents , and correctional facilities — only add to the bureau's enumeration challenges within the borough .
because of brooklyn's demographic diversity and other socioeconomic factors , the bureau has identified a number of sections of brooklyn as particularly hard to count .
census data are also used for planning purposes by the public and private sectors .
for both reviews , we analyzed key documents , including plans , procedures , and guidance for the selected activities , and interviewed cognizant bureau officials at headquarters and local census offices .
while a few miscounted households might not seem particularly problematic , especially in a nation of more than 300 million people , an accurate enumeration is in fact critical .
mr. chairman , with little more than a month remaining until census day , the bureau's efforts to enumerate group quarters generally appear to be on track and more robust compared to similar efforts for the 2000 census , better positioning the bureau for a complete and accurate headcount .
during the first of the three group quarters operations ( group quarters validation ) , approximately 25,000 temporary workers identified over 240,000 group quarters facilities from a workload of over 2 million potential group quarters in both the united states and puerto rico .
ensure that census workers have knowledge of neighborhood culture and living arrangements and possess the language skills to reach out to residents with limited english proficiency .
the bureau developed and tested new procedures to address the difficulties it had in identifying and counting this population during the 2000 census .
during the 2000 census , for a variety of reasons , group quarters were sometimes counted more than once , missed , or included in the wrong location .
