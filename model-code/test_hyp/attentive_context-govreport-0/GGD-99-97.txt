at your request , we will first discuss the status of the national weather service ( nws ) systems modernization and then address the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring noaa's marine data .
in brief , although nws is nearing completion of its systems modernization effort , two significant challenges face it this year â€” deploying the final system of the modernization and ensuring that all of its mission - critical systems are year 2000 compliant .
we appreciate the opportunity to join in today's hearing to discuss our work in two areas under the responsibility of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , a component of the department of commerce .
in the noaa fleet area , noaa now outsources for more of its research and data needs but plans to spend $185 million over the next 5 years to acquire four new replacement noaa fisheries research ships .
last month , we continued to designate the nws systems modernization effort as a high - risk information technology area and the noaa fleet as an additional major management challenge confronting the department of commerce .
nws has made progress on both fronts .
thus , we believe that continued congressional oversight of noaa's budget requests for replacement or upgraded ships is needed to ensure that noaa is pursuing the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring marine data .
over the past several years , we have reported that awips has encountered delays and cost increases due to design problems and management shortcomings and have made several recommendations to improve management of this critical component of the modernization .
nws' system modernization includes four major systems development programs , which are expected to collectively cost about $4.5 billion .
in 1994 , we reported that noaa ( 1 ) lacked the financial and operational data it needed to adequately assess whether chartered and contracted ships could cost effectively meet the needs of its programs and ( 2 ) had no assurance that its fleet modernization plan represented the most cost effective means of meeting future program requirements .
in the 1980s nws began a nationwide modernization program to upgrade observing systems such as satellites and radars , and design and develop advanced computer workstations for forecasters .
the goals of the modernization are to achieve more uniform weather services across the nation , improve forecasting , provide better detection and prediction of severe weather and flooding , permit more cost - effective operations through staff and office reductions , and achieve higher productivity .
in the noaa fleet area , continuing congressional oversight of noaa's budget requests for replacement or upgraded ships is needed to ensure that noaa is pursuing the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring marine data .
until awips is fully deployed and functioning properly , nws will not be able to take full advantage of the $4.5 billion total investment it has made in the modernization .
these concerned the systems' operational effectiveness and efficient maintenance .
while there have been specific performance problems , nws reports that the new radars and satellites overall have enabled it to generate better data and greatly improved forecasts and warnings .
subsequently , the governing international fishery agreement act ( public law 105-384 , approved november 13 , 1998 ) made other changes in noaa's proposed restructuring plan .
