china's accession to the wto , its recent efforts to negotiate bilateral trade agreements ( btas ) across asia ( including the asean - china fta ) , and its unilateral liberalization of its trade regime , has arguably placed china as a major competitor to the united states .
apec is unusual among various trade associations in its reliance on consensus - based , voluntary reductions in tariff and non - tariff trade barriers — as well as a variety of trade facilitation measures — to promote trade and investment liberalization not only between apec members , but for all international trade and investment , an approach often referred to as "open regionalism" ( see " apec's approach to trade liberalization " below ) .
congress and the executive branch have historically identified the asia pacific economic cooperation forum ( apec ) as potentially important in the promotion of liberalized international trade and investment in asia , and possibly the rest of the world .
they advocate both increased financial assistance to apec , through the annual contribution and specific assistance programs , and alteration in u.s. laws and policies on key issues .
in addition to its primary trade mission , apec provides a venue at which the united states can hold bilateral and multilateral discussions on non - economic matters of concern in the asia - pacific region , such as international security and human rights .
many argue that the united states should re - energize its involvement in asian trade discussion and elevate the importance of apec to reassert u.s. leadership .
over the last few years , however , the united states' position as a leader in the region has been challenged by china .
critics of apec , however , point to its apparent slow progress as a demonstration of its ineffectiveness .
others say that apec should reformulate its mission by focusing more narrowly on trade facilitation and economic integration , abandoning many of the working groups that are not central to the core goals , and strengthening the secretariat .
second , congress may take into account u.s. commitments to apec when considering legislation on various trade and non - trade issues .
third , congress may increase oversight of apec - related activities and programs of the u.s. trade representative , the department of state and other federal departments and agencies .
one indicator of previous congressional interest in apec is the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 ( p.l .
for example , the bogor goals set the year 2010 for the achievement of trade and investment liberalization for apec's "developed economies. .
these principles include comprehensiveness ; wto consistency ; comparability ; non - discrimination ; transparency ; flexibility ; and cooperation .
some experts maintain that it is doubtful that apec will ever fulfill the bogor goals , in part because of its reliance on voluntary compliance .
the annual leaders' meeting continues to provide prestige and offer an opportunity for heads of state , particularly those of smaller countries , to interact with top u.s. officials .
that legislation called for the president to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the "emergence of china economically , diplomatically , and militarily ; promote mutually beneficial trade relations with china ; and encourage china's adherence to international norms in the areas of trade , international security , and human rights. .
