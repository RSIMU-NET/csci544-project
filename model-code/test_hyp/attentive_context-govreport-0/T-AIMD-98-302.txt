the year 2000 ( y2k ) computing crisis has received much attention in recent months — and deservedly so .
accordingly , the department has major challenges ahead but limited time remaining to adequately deal with them .
we are pleased to testify before you today on the status of the department of education's efforts to ensure that its computer systems supporting critical student financial aid activities will be able to process information reliably after december 31 , 1999 .
in brief , education faces major risks that year 2000 failures could severely disrupt the student financial aid delivery process , including delaying disbursements and application processing .
education is now accelerating its program , but with the slow start , it remains in a position of playing catch up .
my statement today will describe the risks to the department of education , with a focus on student financial aid systems , actions the department has taken in recent months to address these risks , and key issues the department must deal with if its systems are to be ready for the century change: testing of systems , exchanging data with internal and external partners , and developing business continuity and contingency plans .
therefore , it must also focus on developing appropriate contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of key systems failures .
the department was very slow in implementing a comprehensive year 2000 program to address these risks — basic awareness and assessment tasks were not completed until recently .
further , because of systems interdependencies , repercussions from year 2000-related problems could be felt throughout the student financial aid community — a network including students , institutions of higher education , financial organizations , and other government agencies .
virtually every organization , public and private , that uses computers is at risk .
as the world's most advanced and most dependent user of information technology , the united states possesses close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of internet assets .
consequently , the upcoming change of century is a sweeping and urgent challenge for public - sector and private - sector organizations alike .
our reviews of federal year 2000 programs have found uneven progress , and our reports contain numerous recommendations , which the agencies have almost universally agreed to implement .
while progress has been made in addressing the federal government's year 2000 readiness , serious vulnerabilities remain and many agencies are behind schedule .
while there has been recent progress , the department of education must mitigate critical risks that affect its ability to award and track billions of dollars in student financial aid .
with its slow start , education has been playing catch up and working to accelerate its progress .
to date , we have issued over 60 reports and testimony statements detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies .
for this reason we have designated the year 2000 computing problem as a high - risk area for the federal government , and have published guidanceto help organizations successfully address the issue .
concurrent with its slowness in completing its assessment , education's estimated costs have fluctuated widely .
