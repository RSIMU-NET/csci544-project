recent events , including the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , have highlighted the importance of ensuring proper security at federal facilities .
officials at some of these police forces have raised concerns that disparities in pay and retirement benefits have caused their police forces to experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining officers .
additionally , the recent pay increases received by officers at 12 of the 13 police forces , along with the potential implementation of various human capital flexibilities , might also help to address recruitment and retention issues experienced by many of the police forces .
however , we did not attempt to determine the extent to which these differences accounted for differences in police officer compensation .
as the headquarters location for many federal agencies , the washington , d.c. , metropolitan area is home to numerous federal uniformed police forces .
these concerns increased with the significant expansion of the federal air marshal program , which created numerous relatively high - paying job opportunities for existing federal uniformed police officers and reportedly lured many experienced officers from their uniformed police forces .
however , officials at the 13 police forces included in our review reported that officers separated from their positions for such reasons as to ( 1 ) obtain better pay and / or benefits at other police forces , ( 2 ) work less overtime , and ( 3 ) assume greater responsibility .
given that tsa's federal air marshal program has now been established , and the buildup in staffing has been substantially completed , the increase in turnover experienced in fiscal year 2002 at 12 of the 13 police forces may have been a one - time occurrence .
among the reasons given were better pay at other agencies ; better benefits , including law enforcement retirement , at other agencies ; better morale at other agencies ; more challenging work at other agencies ; promotional opportunities at other agencies ; too much overtime at their police forces ; and retirements from their police forces .
officers with fewer than 5 years of experience on their forces accounted for about 79 percent ( 117 ) of the separations to other federal law enforcement positions , and officers with 5 years to less than 10 years of experience accounted for an additional 16 percent ( 23 ) .
this increase almost equaled the number ( 316 ) of officers who voluntarily separated from their forces to join tsa .
finally , the u.s. secret service noted that fundamental differences exist among the agencies' authorities , responsibilities , duties , and training requirements , and that this could account for differences in compensation .
we have stated in recent reports that the effective , efficient , and transparent use of human capital flexibilities must be a key component of agency efforts to address human capital challenges .
we also interviewed officials at the transportation security administration ( tsa ) and the office of personnel management ( opm ) .
federal police forces provide either standard federal retirement benefits or federal law enforcement retirement benefits .
as agreed with your offices , our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) determine the differences that exist among these federal uniformed police forces regarding entry - level pay , retirement benefits , and types of duties ; ( 2 ) provide information on the differences in turnover rates among these federal uniformed police forces , including where officers who separated from the police forces went and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available and used by the police forces to address turnover ; and ( 3 ) provide information on the possible difficulties police forces may have experienced in recruiting police officers and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available to help these police forces to recruit officers .
