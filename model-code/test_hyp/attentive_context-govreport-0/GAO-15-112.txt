this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing the following three objectives: determining how long the department of justice ( doj ) has taken to resolve federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) whistleblower retaliation complaints and what factors have affected these time frames , determining the extent to which doj has taken steps to resolve complaints more quickly and determine the impact of any such efforts ; and determining the extent to which doj's office of the inspector general ( oig ) and office of professional responsibility ( doj - opr ) have complied with regulatory reporting requirements .
to ensure that complainants receive the periodic updates that they are entitled to and need to determine next steps for their complaint , such as whether or not to seek corrective action from oarm , we recommend that counsel , doj - opr tailor its new case management system or otherwise develop an oversight mechanism to capture information on the office's compliance with regulatory requirements and , further , use that information to monitor and identify opportunities to improve doj - opr's compliance with regulatory requirements .
specifically , our report examines: how long doj has taken to resolve fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints and what factors have affected these time frames ; the extent to which doj has taken steps to resolve complaints more quickly and determine the impact of any such efforts ; and the extent to which doj's oig and doj - opr have complied with regulatory reporting requirements .
in 1998 , the department of justice ( doj ) issued regulations that set forth the process for federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) whistleblowers to report complaints of retaliation for their disclosures .
to assist congress in overseeing doj's efforts to protect fbi whistleblowers , you asked us to examine doj's process for handling fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints .
further , with regard to guidance provided to fbi employees , the oig fully supports providing clear and comprehensive guidance as to all aspects of whistleblower rights and protections .
oig has taken steps to begin tracking compliance with these requirements ; however , doj - opr has not yet taken similar action .
however , whistleblowers also risk retaliation from their employers , sometimes being demoted , reassigned , or fired as a result of their actions .
these initial steps position the agency to satisfy our recommendation that doj - opr tailor its new case management system or otherwise develop an oversight mechanism to capture information on the office's compliance with regulatory reporting requirements .
however , doj officials have limited plans to assess the impacts of these actions .
doj also reported that doj - opr is taking steps , such as developing a report template and upgrading its case management system which , when completed , could help the agency begin systematically tracking investigators' compliance with regulatory reporting requirements .
these regulations require that fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints be directed to doj's office of the inspector general ( oig ) or office of professional responsibility ( doj - opr ) for investigation and provide specific timeliness and reporting requirements for these offices to meet as they manage these complaints .
