misuse and abuse of prescription opioids ( such as oxycodone ) , which are used to treat both acute and chronic pain , has become a serious public health problem in the united states , including among medicare beneficiaries .
for example in the 2020 medicare advantage and part d draft call letter , cms reported that between 2012 and 2017 , there was a 33 percent decrease in the number of part d enrollees meeting or exceeding 90 mme for at least one day , with the largest decrease ( 14 percent ) in 2017 .
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) reported that from 1999 to 2013 the rate of deaths from prescription opioids nearly quadrupled .
in april 2018 , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , which administers the medicare program , finalized regulations implementing dmps for part d medicare's prescription drug option , through which private health insurers known as plan sponsors provide prescription drug coverage to medicare beneficiaries .
in this report , we: 1. describe how medicare identifies beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse and abuse , and how it attempts to mitigate that risk ; 2. identify factors likely to affect the success of the medicare drug management programs .
for medicare , the comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2016 ( cara ) established drug management programs ( dmp ) to limit access to frequently abused drugs for beneficiaries considered to be at risk for their abuse , among other things .
cara included a provision for gao to review the implementation of medicare dmps .
we also interviewed officials from cms , department of health and human services office of inspector general ; america's health insurance plans — a trade association representing health insurers — and from the five largest medicare part d plan sponsors , as measured by enrollment , that together cover about 70 percent of medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage .
finally , cms tracks the utilization of opioids by medicare part d enrollees using part d data and the overutilization monitoring system .
to identify the factors likely to affect the success of the medicare dmps , we reviewed the literature on opioid misuse and abuse , and interviewed officials from cms and other stakeholders , including the five largest medicare part d plan sponsors , and officials with six organizations representing medicare plan sponsors , physicians ( including pain specialists ) , pharmacy benefit managers , state medicaid programs , and patients suffering chronic pain .
the regulations include standards that part d plan sponsors , as well as sponsors of medicare advantage plans that also may offer drug coverage ( hereafter collectively referred to as plan sponsors ) , may use to identify potentially at - risk beneficiaries .
to describe how medicare identifies beneficiaries that are at risk of opioid misuse and abuse , and how it attempts to mitigate that risk , we reviewed the recommendations contained in cdc's guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain and cms's opioid misuse strategy , as well as cms regulations , and other relevant cms guidance .
in 2017 , 47,600 overdose deaths in the united states involved an opioid , and prescription opioids were involved in many of these deaths .
