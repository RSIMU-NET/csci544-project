you also asked us determine the disclosure and sales practices of banks and thrifts with respect to mutual funds , and to evaluate the framework for regulation and oversight of bank and thrift mutual fund operations .
this report presents the results of our review of bank and thrift sales of mutual funds .
you requested that we report on the extent to which banks and thrifts have expanded into mutual fund activities .
this report recommends that the banking and securities regulators develop a common approach for conducting examinations of bank and thrift mutual fund activities .
as agreed with you , unless you publicly release its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date .
at that time , we will provide copies to interested members of congress , appropriate committees , the federal deposit insurance corporation , the board of governors of the federal reserve system , the office of the comptroller of the currency , the office of thrift supervision , the national association of securities dealers , the securities and exchange commission , other interested parties , and the public .

in addition to the requirements of the securities regulators , the banking regulators' guidance states that advertisements and other promotional and sales material about nondeposit investment products sold to retail customers of depository institutions should conspicuously disclose that these products are not insured by fdic ; are not a deposit or other obligation of , or guaranteed by , the institution ; and are subject to investment risks , including possible loss of principal .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the extent and nature of bank and thrift involvement in mutual fund sales , ( 2 ) assess whether the sales practices followed by banks and thrifts provide bank customers adequate disclosures of the risks of investing in mutual funds , and ( 3 ) analyze whether the existing framework for regulation and oversight of bank and thrift mutual fund sales practices and proprietary fund operations adequately protects investors .
but there were no signs there .
the mutual fund industry's growth in the last decade has been phenomenal .
similarly , about 60 percent of thrifts with assets of $1 billion or more had sales programs , but only about 3 percent of thrifts with assets less than $100 million sold mutual funds .
however , fee income may become more important after sales begin .
the banking regulators have recognized the importance of closely monitoring institutions' mutual fund sales programs and have adopted procedures to be included in periodic safety and soundness examinations , which they are currently implementing .
very poor job of disclosing risks and uninsured nature .
specifically , when nondeposit investment products are either recommended or sold to retail customers , the disclosures must specify that the product is ( 1 ) not insured by fdic ; ( 2 ) not a deposit or other obligation of the institution ; ( 3 ) not guaranteed by the institution ; and ( 4 ) subject to investment risks , including possible loss of the principal amount invested .
