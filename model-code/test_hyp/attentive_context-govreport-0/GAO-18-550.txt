the department of homeland security ( dhs ) invests billions of dollars each year in major acquisition programs to assist in executing its many critical missions .
this report discusses ( 1 ) how often selected department of homeland security ( dhs ) programs changed requirements ; and assesses the extent to which the selected components have ( 2 ) developed policies for requirements development , ( 3 ) established independent requirements organizations , and ( 4 ) taken steps to assess and train a requirements workforce .
 ( recommendation 25 ) .
in november 2014 , in response to a gao recommendation , the department reestablished the joint requirements council ( jrc ) that the department had dissolved in 2006 , to review requirements submitted by dhs's component agencies ( e.g. , the transportation security administration ) .
this report discusses ( 1 ) how often selected programs changed requirements ; and assesses the extent to which the selected components have ( 2 ) developed policies for requirements development , ( 3 ) established independent requirements organizations , and ( 4 ) taken steps to assess and train a requirements workforce .
the purpose of the council is to validate and prioritize operational requirements — those capabilities that are necessary to conduct dhs's mission — for all major acquisitions and to ensure that objective , analytical rigor supports these requirements .
we subsequently found that several programs did not meet their key performance parameters — the most important requirements a capability must meet — after initial approval by dhs and deployed capabilities prior to meeting all of their key performance parameters , leaving their true capabilities in doubt .
in its comments , dhs concurred with all 25 of our recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to address them .
dhs leadership acknowledged that the department has had difficulty defining key performance parameters , and said that the office of program accountability and risk management has improved its ability to help programs define key performance parameters .
 ( recommendation 24 ) in addition , the secretary of dhs should ensure that training for requirements development is consistent by establishing training and certification standards for dhs and the components' requirements development workforces .
national flood insurance program pivot ( not an acronym ) : federal emergency management agency officials told us that the current attempt is the third effort to modernize its information technology systems after two failed attempts .
to inform each of our objectives , we interviewed officials at various levels throughout dhs to understand both their relationship to and role in components' requirements development , including: ( 1 ) department - level , ( 2 ) component - level , ( 3 ) program - level , and ( 4 ) program end users .
poorly defined key performance parameters can increase the risk that end users — such as border patrol agents or first responders in a disaster — receive capabilities that do not meet their missions .
dhs initially established its acquisition process in policy in november 2008 .
however , dhs remains at risk until such training and certification are fully implemented throughout dhs and its components .
once programs begin , requirements should not change without assessing their potential disruption to the program .
