tens of thousands of people served as responders in the aftermath of the wtc disaster , including new york city fire department ( fdny ) personnel , federal government personnel , and thousands who came to new york city ( nyc ) from around the country .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the implementation of federally funded health programs for individuals affected by the september 11 , 2001 , attack on the world trade center ( wtc ) .
six years after the destruction of the wtc buildings , concerns remain about the physical and mental health effects of the disaster , the long - term nature of some of these health effects , and the availability of health care services for those affected .
hhs continues to fund and coordinate the wtc health programs and has key federal responsibility for ensuring the availability of services to responders .
we also reported that the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , the component of hhs's centers for disease control and prevention responsible for administering most of the wtc health programs , had begun to take steps to provide access to screening , monitoring , and treatment services for nonfederal responders who resided outside the nyc metropolitan area .
following the wtc attack , federal funding was provided to government agencies and private organizations to establish programs for screening , monitoring , or treating responders for illnesses and conditions related to the wtc disaster ; these programs are referred to in this testimony as the wtc health programs .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) funded the programs as separate efforts serving different categories of responders — for example , firefighters , other workers and volunteers , or federal responders — and has responsibility for coordinating program efforts .
however , these efforts are not complete , and the stop - and - start history of the department's efforts to serve these responders does not provide assurance that the latest efforts to extend screening and monitoring services to them will be successful and will be sustained over time .
we also interviewed officials of organizations that worked with niosh to provide or facilitate services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , including the mount sinai school of medicine in nyc and the association of occupational and environmental clinics ( aoec ) — a network of university - affiliated and other private occupational health clinics across the united states and in canada .
hhs established the program in june 2003 , suspended it in march 2004 , resumed it in december 2005 , suspended it again in january 2007 , and resumed it in may 2007 .
as of january 2008 , the department has not responded to this recommendation .
we also previously reported that one of the wtc health programs , hhs's wtc federal responder screening program , which was established to provide onetime screening examinations for responders who were federal employees when they responded to the wtc attack , has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of services .
therefore we recommended in july 2007 that the secretary of hhs take expeditious action to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the attack on the wtc , regardless of where they reside .
