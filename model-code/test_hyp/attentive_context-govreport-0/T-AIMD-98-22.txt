i am pleased to be here today to discuss the importance of having strong chief information officers ( cios ) at major federal agencies and ensuring an effective cio council to help bring about much - needed reforms in the government's management of information technology ( it ) .
during the last decade , much attention has been focused on serious problems with federal information technology projects .
to help reverse this trend , gao embarked on a concerted effort to learn how leading private and public sector organizations controlled system development projects and successfully applied technology to improve their performance .
based upon our work and that of others , the congress , in conjunction with the administration , crafted two recent landmark reforms in federal information management: the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) of 1995 and the clinger - cohen act of 1996 .
the picture that unfolded year after year was bleak: multimillion dollar and , in some cases , billion dollar system development efforts routinely came in over cost , behind schedule , and lacking in promised capabilities .
our views are based not only on our work in the technology area , but also on our experiences in evaluating the implementation of other major management reforms , such as the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 and the government performance and results act ( results act ) of 1993 .
in addition to wasting resources , these disappointing efforts seriously weakened agencies' abilities to meet mission goals and improve operational efficiency .
the challenge facing the federal government today is to provide the type of leadership needed to implement information technology reforms as rapidly as possible .
furthermore , the agency cios , working collectively as a council , have a critical leadership role to play in addressing governmentwide technology issues and advising the office of management and budget ( omb ) on policies and standards needed to successfully implement legislative reforms .
our resulting study identified a specific set of strategic practices that these organizations use to improve performance through information management .
although we are beginning to see some progress , agencies still have a long way to go to translate legislative mandates into day - to - day management reality .
under the law , agency heads are directly responsible for effective information management , but cios play a critical leadership role in driving reforms to help control system development risks , better manage technology spending , and succeed in achieving real , measurable improvements in agency performance .
the following sections offer our observations on the status of efforts to promote effective cio leadership and the challenges and opportunities faced by the cio council .
these reforms encompass many important elements identified in our best practices work , such as establishing more disciplined information technology investment control processes , developing an overall information architecture , and defining measures to show how information technology is contributing to improved program performance .
central to implementing these reforms is the need to establish effective leadership at each agency .
also , building federal agencies' capability to manage information resources has been a critical problem for years .
it is very important for omb to follow through on its efforts to assess cio appointments and resolve outstanding issues .
