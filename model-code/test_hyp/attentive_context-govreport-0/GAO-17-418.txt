this report assesses: ( 1 ) the extent to which the navy provides complete , quality ships to the fleet that are free of government and contractor deficiencies ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the navy's policy governing ship delivery facilitates efforts to deliver complete and quality ships ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which navy reports to congress on the progress of shipbuilding programs consistently define key milestones such as ship delivery and initial operational capability .
for this review , we assessed: ( 1 ) the extent to which the navy provides complete , quality ships to the fleet that are free of government and contractor deficiencies ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the navy's policy governing ship delivery facilitates efforts to deliver complete and quality ships ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which reports to congress on the progress of shipbuilding programs consistently define key milestones such as ship delivery and initial operational capability .
the u.s. navy spends at least $18 billion per year on its new construction shipbuilding programs , with a portion of this money spent after delivery on work to prepare the ships for the fleet .
over the past several years , we have reported on significant cost growth and quality problems facing several navy shipbuilding programs .
revise the navy's ship delivery policy to clarify what types of deficiencies need to be corrected and what mission capability ( including the levels of quality and capability ) must be achieved at ( 1 ) delivery and ( 2 ) when the ship is provided to the fleet ( at owld ) .
in september 2014 , we found that littoral combat ship ( lcs ) 1 and 2 , while legally accepted by the government , had quality problems that persisted after delivery .
in may 2009 , we compared navy shipbuilding with commercial shipbuilding and generally found that the navy accepts significantly more risk when it builds ships compared to commercial shipbuilders and buyers .
in november 2013 , we found significant quality problems with navy ships at delivery â€” noting that the navy regularly accepts ships with numerous deficiencies .
most recently , in march 2016 , we found that the navy pays for the vast majority of shipbuilder - responsible deficiencies discovered after the navy takes delivery of its ships .
senate report 114-255 to accompany a bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for us to review the delivery process from the time the navy takes custody of ships until they are complete and ready for operations , particularly in light of the navy's delivery strategies for the cvn 78-class of aircraft carriers and ddg 1000-class of destroyers .
reflect additional ship milestones in selected acquisition reports to congress , including owld and readiness to deploy .
in addition , you asked us to review the period after ship delivery , including the extent to which and why the navy defers construction work to the post - delivery period , specifically as it relates to aircraft carrier and lead ship construction .
the navy's selected acquisition reports to congress do not clearly communicate its ships' progress and completion , which can inhibit oversight , particularly for measuring results .
