the manner by which hong kong selects its next chief executive ( ce ) in 2017 may be a bellwether for the prospects for the democratization of the city's governance system .
although china's leaders have agreed in principle that the chief executive for the hong kong special administrative region of the people's republic of china ( hksar ) may be chosen by universal suffrage in 2017 , the conditions placed on the method of nominating candidates may prove to be unacceptable to the people of hong kong and the city's legislature , the legislative council ( legco ) .
controversies over restrictions on the ce's proposal to legco imposed by an august 2014 decision of china's national people's congress standing committee ( npcsc ) have led to ongoing protests across hong kong and serious opposition from some legco members .

the prospects for democratic election reforms in hong kong are of potential interest to congress for several reasons .
it remains to be seen if this effectively ends prospects for reforming the ce selection method before the 2017 election , or if the npcsc , ce leung , or legco will identify a new path toward the ce's election by universal suffrage .
in december 2005 , legco voted down proposed ce election reforms after up to 250,000 people rallied against the proposed reforms .
on december 29 , 2007 , in response to a request from then ce donald tsang yam - kuen , the npcsc issued "decision on issues relating to the methods of selecting the chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region and for forming the legislative council of the hong kong special administrative region in the year 2012 and on issues relating to universal suffrage," which stated that the chief executive may be elected by universal suffrage in 2017 .
