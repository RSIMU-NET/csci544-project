in 2010 , the federal government spent about $114 billion on the medicare advantage ( ma ) program , a private plan alternative to the original medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) program that covers about a quarter of all medicare beneficiaries .
such steps could include , for example , accounting for additional beneficiary characteristics , including the most current data available , identifying and accounting for all years of coding differences that could affect the payment year for which an adjustment is made , and incorporating the trend of the impact of coding differences on risk scores .
to help ensure appropriate payments to ma plans , the administrator of cms should take steps to improve the accuracy of the adjustment made for differences in diagnostic coding practices between ma and medicare ffs .
if cms does not update its methodology , excess payments due to differences in coding practices are likely to increase .
by not updating its estimate with more current data , cms also did not account for the additional years of cumulative coding differences in its estimate: 4 years for 2011 ( 2007 to 2011 ) and 5 years for 2012 ( 2007 to 2012 ) .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency that administers medicare , pays ma plans a monthly amount to provide health care services for each beneficiary enrolled in these plans .
information on a beneficiary's age , sex , medicaid enrollment status , original reason for medicare entitlement ( i.e. , age or disability ) , and major medical conditions all factor into the calculation of the risk score .
risk adjustment is important to ensure that payments to ma plans adequately account for differences in beneficiaries' health status and to maintain plans' financial incentive to enroll and care for beneficiaries regardless of their health status or the resources they are likely to consume .
this appendix explains the scope and methodology that we used to address our objective that determines the extent to which differences , if any , in diagnostic coding between medicare advantage ( ma ) plans and medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) affect risk scores and payments to ma plans in 2010 .
for its 2011 and 2012 adjustments , the agency continued to use the same estimate of the impact of coding differences it used in 2010 , which likely resulted in excess payments to ma plans .
risk adjustment helps ensure that a plan's financial incentive to enroll and care for beneficiaries is similar for all beneficiaries regardless of their health status or the resources they are likely to consume .
the cms data we analyzed on medicare beneficiaries are collected from medicare providers and ma plans .
we found that cms's 3.41 percent adjustment for coding differences in 2010 was too low , resulting in $1.2 billion to $3.1 billion in payments to ma plans for coding differences .
for example , beneficiaries in poorer health are generally expected to use more health care services relative to beneficiaries in better health .
if an adjustment for coding differences is too low , cms would pay ma plans more than it would pay providers in medicare ffs to provide health care for the same beneficiaries .
