in addition , the next administration should focus its attention on: ( 1 ) adopting a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing governmentwide performance ; ( 2 ) improving the relevance of performance information to congress ; and ( 3 ) building agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making .
recent events , such as lead paint in imported children's products , tainted meat , predatory mortgage lending , contract fraud , and national disasters like hurricane katrina and the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , raise questions among the american people about the capacity of the federal government to meet their most pressing needs .
congress enacted the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) to inform congressional and executive decision making by providing objective information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending .
additionally , the nation's long - term fiscal imbalance drives the need for federal agencies to allocate increasingly scarce resources in the most efficient and effective way possible .
you asked us to discuss: ( 1 ) the trends in federal managers' reported use of performance information governmentwide and at the agency level as identified through four surveys we conducted over the past 10 years ; ( 2 ) how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to improve federal program management ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned to be considered by the next congress and administration for future performance improvement initiatives .
the next administration can continue to bring a greater focus on improving the performance of federal programs and ensuring that federal funds are allocated effectively by building on the strengths of prior performance improvement initiatives .
first , the next administration should promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the last decade to ensure that the performance information gathered is used in making management decisions: ( 1 ) demonstrating leadership commitment to results - oriented management ; ( 2 ) developing a clear “line of sight” linking individual performance with organizational results ; and ( 3 ) building agency capacity to collect and use performance information .
that same year , the clinton administration launched the national performance review ( npr ) , which was intended to make the government “work better and cost less.” the current administration has also attempted to resolve long - standing federal management weaknesses through its five governmentwide management priorities under the president's management agenda ( pma ) , which was first announced in 2001 .
over the past 15 years , various reform efforts have attempted to shift the focus of federal government management from a preoccupation with activities to the results or outcomes of those activities .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the results of our 2007 survey on performance and management issues and lessons learned over the past 15 years through legislative and executive efforts to improve the management and performance of the federal government .
however , we have found that progress is still needed to further integrate information about program performance into federal managers' decision making and ensure continued progress .
beyond this , the next administration can better focus its efforts to improve performance by ( 1 ) adopting a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing performance ; ( 2 ) improving the relevance of performance information to congress ; and ( 3 ) building agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making .
