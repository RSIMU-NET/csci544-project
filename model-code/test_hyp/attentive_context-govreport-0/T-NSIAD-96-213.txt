export assistance centers ( useac ) .
i am pleased to be here today to testify before this subcommittee on our work regarding efforts by the department of commerce , the u.s. export - import bank ( eximbank ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) to create a nationwide network of “one - stop shops,” called u.s .
my testimony will address both the benefits realized at the first four useacs established as well as opportunities for improving their operations .
as part of our review , we visited each of the four original useacs for a period of 1 week during may - june 1995 and obtained information , using interviews and surveys , from useac staff members , selected customers , and officials of nonfederal partner organizations that work closely with them .
 ( see the appendix for more detailed information on our surveys. ) .
this legislation also directed the u.s. & foreign commercial service — the commerce department agency responsible for managing its domestic field network — to utilize its district offices as “one - stop - shops.” these shops would be able to ( 1 ) provide exporters with information on all u.s. government export promotion and export finance services , ( 2 ) assist exporters in identifying which federal programs may be of greatest assistance , and ( 3 ) help exporters make contact with those federal programs .
creation of the useac network can be best understood in the context of sweeping efforts made during this decade to strengthen federal delivery of export promotion services .
partially in response to our work , congress enacted the export enhancement act of 1992 ( public law 102-429 , oct. 21 , 1992 ) , which created in statute the interagency trade promotion coordinating committee ( tpcc ) and tasked it with developing a strategic plan for strengthening federal export promotion services .
tpcc , on september 30 , 1993 , issued its first national export strategy report , which contained 65 recommendations for federal action to help u.s. exporters .
we then reported on a governmentwide effort that cost over $2.7 billion and that was fragmented among several agencies with no overarching strategy or explicit set of priorities .
some useac directors also saw the need for ( 1 ) adequate authority over useac expenditures and ( 2 ) a useac - wide accounting system that would permit useacs to accurately identify and allocate costs and better manage expenditures .
based on our review , we recommend that the secretary of commerce , working with the chairman of the eximbank and the administrator of sba give all useac directors the authority to contribute to the performance appraisals of all useac staff with regard to intra - useac cooperation and teamwork ( including development of an appropriate performance factor for staff appraisals and performance measures ) , establish a useac - specific customer tracking system that contains information on clients and services provided to them , and set up an accounting system that accurately tracks the full costs of creating and operating the useac network and , as part of that process , incorporate ways to give useac directors greater authority over useac expenditures .
with respect to other factors , useac staff believed the useacs had ( 1 ) improved the quality of services they personally deliver ( 63 percent ) , ( 2 ) increased export - ready customers' ability to export ( 58 percent ) , and ( 3 ) improved cooperation with nonfederal partners ( 50 percent ) .
