 ( recommendation 2 ) .
highway and transit projects that use federal funds are subject to federal requirements , including requirements under the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) , to analyze the potential environmental effects of proposed projects ; such evaluations are called environmental impact statements or environmental assessments , which we refer to in this report as “environmental reviews” .
our work focused on federal - aid highway and transit projects and the provisions included in the past three surface - transportation reauthorizations that are intended to streamline the environmental consulting and permitting processes performed by the three federal resource agencies: fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) , and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) .
in addition , other environmental protection laws sometimes require “federal resource agencies” — such as the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the u.s .
the past three surface transportation reauthorization acts — the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea - lu ) in 2005 , the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) in 2012 , and the fixing america's surface transportation act ( fast act ) in 2015 — contain a number of provisions aimed at accelerating the environmental review process for highway and transit projects .
this report: addresses the extent to which identified streamlining provisions have had an impact on the time frames for the environmental consulting and permitting processes ; identifies actions taken by federal resource agencies to streamline their consulting and permitting reviews and identifies additional streamlining opportunities , if any ; and describes the actions taken by ceq to accelerate highway and transit projects .
fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , and the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) — to issue permit decisions or perform consultations before a project can proceed .
for transportation projects , including highway and transit projects , additional streamlining provisions have been enacted for environmental reviews .
the fast act included provisions for us to assess , among other things , the extent to which the streamlining provisions in the three most recent transportation reauthorization acts have improved and accelerated the environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects .
in addition , the council on environmental quality ( ceq ) , an executive office of the white house established in nepa , is responsible for overseeing nepa implementation and issues regulations and guidance that , among other things , are intended to make environmental reviews more efficient .
fws and nmfs do not have adequate internal control procedures in place to ensure accurate and reliable data and cannot accurately assess their ability to meet statutory and regulatory requirements for completing consultations and issuing biological opinions .
furthermore , agency and government - wide efforts to track major infrastructure projects , such as the planned office of management and budget performance tracking system , will be hindered without accurate and reliable data .
although fws and nmfs are in the process of upgrading their data systems , the agencies do not have documented plans or time frames that identify what controls they will use to ensure accurate data on the time taken for consultation reviews .
