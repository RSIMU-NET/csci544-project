the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , through its federal housing administration ( fha ) , annually insures billions of dollars in home mortgage loans made by private lenders .
our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the deployment of staff at the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) homeownership centers , ( 2 ) the training provided to center staff , and ( 3 ) the centers' monitoring of their contractors .
compared with private mortgage insurers , fha is more likely to insure loans for low - income and minority borrowers .
in 1997 , hud issued its 2020 management reform plan , which provided for downsizing and reforming the department , including its single - family mortgage insurance program .
to carry out its mission , fha relies on private lenders to determine borrowers' creditworthiness and to make and fund loans .
finally , fha relies on contractors to help assess lenders' compliance with its requirements , monitor the performance of appraisers , and manage and sell the properties it acquires through foreclosure .
although hud has substantially streamlined fha's single - family mortgage insurance programs , human capital issues remain a concern .
these problems increased hud's insurance risk and limited its ability to recoup losses upon foreclosure .
fha's mission is to expand homeownership in the united states by assuming 100 percent of the risk for the mortgages it insures .
without careful oversight of these lenders , appraisers , and contractors , fha is vulnerable to mismanagement and fraud .
in the absence of such procedures , hud has not been making the most efficient use of its monitoring resources .
the department recently incorporated risk factors in its monitoring of lenders and appraisers and has begun to incorporate risk factors in its monitoring of management and marketing contractors .
since we have made a number of recommendations in the past designed to improve hud's oversight of its contractors , we are making no new recommendations in this report regarding contractor oversight .
our previous work at the centers has shown that their monitoring of contractors has been inadequate .
the centers' failure to develop effective selection procedures for reviewing contractors' work , including procedures that incorporate risk factors into contractor oversight , has affected the centers' ability to monitor their contractors .
although hud has begun to use our human capital self - assessment checklist to assess its human capital plans for the department as a whole , it has not developed a strategic human capital management plan for the homeownership centers .
as part of its 2020 reforms , hud consolidated the single - family program's field activities — such as processing mortgage insurance and overseeing lenders — at four new regional homeownership centers and specified resources for the centers .
finally , to determine how well the centers have monitored their contractors , we reviewed reports on our prior work at the centers involving hud's oversight of appraisers and lenders and its experiences with management and marketing contractors and similar reports issued by hud's inspector general .
the plan stated that the homeownership centers would , among other things , ( 1 ) provide faster , more uniform , and more efficient services to clients , lenders , and borrowers ; ( 2 ) improve hud's risk assessment , loss mitigation , and quality assurance activities ; ( 3 ) increase hud's production of single - family loans to targeted populations ; and ( 4 ) cut the processing time for insurance endorsements from 2 weeks to 1 day .
