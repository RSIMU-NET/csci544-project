this report assesses ( 1 ) the department of energy's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration's ( nnsa ) management approach for the b61-12 life extension program ( lep ) and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa and the air force are managing risks in the lep .
to maintain the readiness of the b61 and other weapons in the stockpile , the department of energy's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) and dod undertake life extension programs ( lep ) that entail refurbishing or replacing weapons' components to extend the lives of weapons by 20 years or more .
many weapons in the u.s. nuclear stockpile have aged far beyond their designed operational lives and , according to the department of defense ( dod ) , require modernization to ensure that the nuclear arsenal is safe , secure , and effective for as long as such weapons exist .
some of the oldest of the weapons in the active stockpile are versions of the b61 bomb , an aircraft - delivered weapon that is a key component of the united states' commitments to the north atlantic treaty organization's ( nato ) nuclear deterrent .
we are not making new recommendations in this report .
potential challenges nnsa and dod have identified include the following: limited management capability and authority .
this report assesses ( 1 ) nnsa's management approach for the b61-12 lep and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa and the air force are managing risks in the lep .
given nnsa's past problems in executing leps , and a schedule with little room for delays , nnsa and air force may face challenges in the future in ensuring that risks are not realized and do not affect the program's schedule , its cost , or the performance of the b61-12 .
leps may also enhance safety and security characteristics of weapons , as well as consolidate the stockpile into fewer weapon types to minimize maintenance and testing costs while preserving needed military capabilities .
we provided a draft of this report to doe and dod for review and comment .
under the b61 lep , nnsa and the air force — the armed service responsible for air - delivered weapons such as the b61 — plan to consolidate four of the five versions of the b61 bomb ( b61 legacy bombs ) , each of which was designed to fulfill specific military requirements , into a single weapon known as the b61-12 , which will be equipped with a new tail kit guidance assembly that will enable it to meet all military requirements .
we will continue to assess the b61-12 lep as it passes through later stages of the phase 6.x process , in keeping with the senate report provision that gave rise to this report .
these problems resulted in delays , additional expenditures , difficulties tracking the cost of the w76 program , and a b61 refurbishment that did not meet all of nnsa's and dod's technical objectives .
for example , according to nnsa documents , nnsa plans to execute at least four leps per year simultaneously in fiscal years 2021 through 2025 — along with several major construction projects , including efforts to modernize nnsa's uranium and plutonium capabilities .
