the program was reauthorized in 1992 by the small business research and development enhancement act to ( 1 ) expand and improve the sbir program , ( 2 ) emphasize the program's goal of increasing the private sector's commercialization of technologies , ( 3 ) increase small businesses' participation in federal r&d , and ( 4 ) improve the federal government's dissemination of information concerning the program , particularly with regard to participation in the program by women - owned small business concerns and by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns .
as a nation competing in a global economy , the united states depends heavily on innovation through research and development ( r&d ) .
because small business is a principal source of significant innovation , the congress established the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program in 1982 .
the program's funding in fiscal year 1997 totaled approximately $1 billion .
the act also mandated that we prepare two reports: an interim report by march 30 , 1995 , and this final report .
the number of multiple - award recipients and the extent of their project - related activity after receiving sbir funding .
the extent of companies' project activity after receiving sbir funding and agencies' techniques to foster commercialization .
agencies' audits of extramural ( external ) r&d budgets .
as agreed with your offices and in accordance with the 1992 act , this report discusses the following aspects of the sbir program: agencies' adherence to statutory funding requirements .
the effect of the application review process and funding cycles on award recipients .
we also relied on a database of sbir award recipients maintained by the small business administration ( sba ) , as well as the results of our 1991 survey of award recipients from the first 4 years of the program — 1984 through 1987 — and the results of a 1996 department of defense ( dod ) survey of dod's award recipients , which closely followed our 1991 survey format .
the occurrence of funding for single - proposal awards .
to address these issues , we interviewed agency officials from five of the sbir participating agencies , which accounted for over 95 percent of the program's overall budget in fiscal year 1996 .
the extent to which foreign firms benefit from the results of sbir .
the geographical distribution of sbir awards .
participation by women - owned businesses and socially and economically disadvantaged businesses .
sba currently has a survey under way of all non - dod sbir award recipients , which is being conducted by the same contractor that performed the dod survey and which also closely follows our earlier format .
sbir's promotion of the critical technologies .
