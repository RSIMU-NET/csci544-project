in response to the request of the previous chairman of the subcommittee for information on how well kinship care is serving foster children , this report describes ( 1 ) the quality of care that children in kinship care receive compared with that received by other foster children , as measured by a caseworker's assessment of a caregiver's parenting skills , the extent to which a foster child is able to maintain contact with familiar people and surroundings , and a caregiver's willingness to enforce court - ordered restrictions on parental visits ; ( 2 ) the frequency with which state child welfare agencies pursue various permanent living arrangements ( that is , permanency planning goals ) and the time children in kinship care have spent in the system compared with other foster children ; and ( 3 ) recent state initiatives intended to help ensure that children in kinship care receive good quality foster care and are placed in permanent homes in a timely manner .
105-89 ) , which includes provisions to ensure foster children's safety and to speed up the process for finding permanent homes for them when they cannot return to their parents .
104-193 ) required the states to consider giving priority to relatives when deciding where to place the quarter of a million children who enter foster care each year while they are in the child welfare system .
research has shown , however , that foster children in kinship care may not always receive good quality care , remain in the system longer than other foster children , and are less likely to find a permanent home outside the foster care system when they cannot return to their parents .

the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is responsible for the administration and oversight of federal funding to states for services to foster children under title iv - e of the social security act .
differences in permanency goals and time in foster care , therefore , may depend more on state policies and practices than on foster care setting .
in conducting this work , we reviewed recent research , federal statutes and regulations , and california and illinois legislation and initiatives regarding kinship care .
we selected these two states because they have large kinship care populations , have different child welfare administration structures , and are located in different geographic areas .
moreover , both states have taken initiatives either to make homes with relatives a viable permanency option or to facilitate permanency planning .
in addition , we surveyed samples of foster care cases in california and illinois that were in their foster care systems on september 15 , 1997 , and had been there since at least march 1 , 1997 .
however , california child welfare officials provided oral comments , limited to technical issues related to information about their programs .
hhs generally agreed with the report and also described a number of activities of its administration for children and families that it believes will help inform both policy and the child welfare field .
