the environmental protection agency ( epa ) is responsible for reviewing the environmental and health effects of chemicals in commerce and chemicals that have yet to enter commerce .
epa's ability to effectively implement its mission of protecting public health and the environment depends on its credible and timely assessments of the risks posed by chemicals .
epa stated that during these meetings they discuss their organizations' operations and performance , including tsca implementation status , using performance charts to track progress on mission measures , identify and update countermeasures , and resolve problems .
rather , the company has decided to pursue commercialization in europe , which will enable the company to deliver the benefits of this new technology to their customers in the european market sooner than is possible in the united states .
this report describes ( 1 ) the extent to which the iris program has addressed identified challenges and made progress toward producing chemical assessments and ( 2 ) the extent to which epa has demonstrated progress , if at all , implementing tsca , and the key challenges that remain .
epa also faces challenges in developing guidance to ensure consistency in implementing the law .
the agency's integrated risk information system ( iris ) program identifies and characterizes the health hazards of chemicals and produces chemical assessments that contain this information .
in its written comments , epa stated that while the draft comprehensively describes the challenges facing the tsca and iris programs , it does not appropriately address epa's extensive progress in implementing tsca , and epa recommended that our final report include information regarding its accomplishments under the new law .
however , epa does not expect a budget shortfall in fiscal year 2019 because , according to officials , they ( 1 ) have funds available from 2018 to support fiscal year 2019 needs , ( 2 ) receive support from other epa offices like the office of general counsel and the office of research and development , ( 3 ) expect fiscal year 2019 costs to be lower than the 3-year average described in the fees rule , and ( 4 ) expect some indirect costs to be covered by non - tsca budget categories .
specifically , we report on the steps epa has taken to respond to the requirements of the law because in many instances , whether epa's response is legally sufficient is in litigation , and gao does not typically express a view on legal or factual matters in dispute before a court .
the toxic substances control act of 1976 ( tsca ) provides epa with the authority to review chemicals already in commerce ( existing chemicals ) and chemicals yet to enter commerce ( new chemicals ) , obtain more information on the effects of chemicals on human health and the environment , and regulate those that epa determines pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment .
the iris program has addressed many process challenges , such as by making changes to address the length of time it takes to develop chemical assessments and to increase transparency , but epa has not made progress toward producing chemical assessments .
currently more than 40,000 active chemical substances exist in commerce in the united states , with more new chemicals submitted to epa for review every year .
