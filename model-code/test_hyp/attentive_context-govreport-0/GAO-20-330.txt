the health and safety of pregnant women in the custody of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) have been a concern in recent years for a number of policymakers , medical associations , and advocacy groups .
this report examines ( 1 ) what available data indicate about pregnant women detained or held in dhs facilities ; ( 2 ) policies and standards that dhs has to address the care of pregnant women , and the extent to which they are applicable across all facilities ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the care provided to pregnant women in dhs facilities .
specifically , this includes information on our analyses of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) data and inspection findings and department of homeland security ( dhs ) complaints used to address these questions: 1 .
in addition , some members of congress have introduced bills to , in part , limit the use of restraints on pregnant women , set healthcare standards , and require the use of alternatives to detention for pregnant women .
specifically , on january 25 , 2017 , the president issued an executive order instructing federal agencies , including dhs , to employ all lawful means to ensure the enforcement of the immigration laws of the united states against all removable foreign nationals .
in 2017 , the president issued a series of executive orders related to border security and immigration , including an executive order that addressed dhs's immigration enforcement priorities .
with regard to the three complaints that involved allegations against both ice and cbp , one remained open as part of an on - going investigation , while the other two complaints were found to be unsubstantiated .
to address all three objectives , we interviewed dhs officials from ice and u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) in headquarters and four field locations , pregnant detainees , and non - governmental organizations ( ngo ) to obtain their perspectives on the care of pregnant women in dhs custody .
the letter reported that the maternal psychological state in detention can negatively affect fetal and child development and that shackling during pregnancy can have serious physical and mental health impacts on pregnant women .
for example , a march 2018 letter written to dhs by various medical groups noted their concerns about the health risks associated with detaining pregnant women .
dhs cannot practicably pursue immigration enforcement action against all persons who may be subject to removal from the united states , and , therefore , dhs must continue to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of u.s. immigration law , given the administration's removal priorities and available resources .
you asked us to review issues related to dhs's detention of pregnant women .
policies and detention standards we analyzed included ( 1 ) ice policies and detention standards that govern the conditions of confinement at ice detention facilities , and ( 2 ) cbp policies for border patrol and ofo , and cbp's national standards .
dhs also provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
in accordance with the executive order and memorandum , dhs is no longer required to allocate resources according to tiered immigration enforcement priorities , which had previously placed threats to national security , border security , and public safety in the highest priority category .
