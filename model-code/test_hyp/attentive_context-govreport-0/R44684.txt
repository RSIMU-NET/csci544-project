the length of time a congressional staff member spends employed in congress , or job tenure , is a source of recurring interest among members of congress , congressional staff , those who study staffing in the house and senate , and the public .
there may be interest in congressional tenure information from multiple perspectives , including assessment of how a congressional office might oversee human resources issues , how staff might approach a congressional career , and guidance for how frequently staffing changes may occur in various positions .
others might be interested in how staff are deployed , and could see staff tenure as an indication of the effectiveness or well - being of congress as an institution .
this report provides tenure data for 18 staff position titles that are typically used in senators' offices , and information for using those data for different purposes .
other data concerns arise from the variation across offices , lack of other demographic information about staff , and lack of information about where congressional staff work .
it is unknown whether , or to what extent , the location of congressional employment might affect the duration of that employment .
data in this report are instead based on official senate pay reports , from which tenure information arguably may be most reliably derived , and which afford the opportunity to use complete , consistently collected data .
tenure information provided in this report is based on the senate's report of the secretary of the senate , published semiannually , as collated by legistorm , a private entity that provides some congressional data by subscription .
all employment pay dates from october 2 , 2000 , to march 24 of each reported year are included in the data .
potential differences might exist in the job duties of positions with the same or similar title , and there is wide variation among the job titles used for various positions in congressional offices .
since tenure data are not captured before october 2 , 2000 , some individuals , represented as jobholder a , may have an unknown length of service prior to that date that is not captured .
for each year , all staff with at least one week's service on march 31 were included .
annual data allow for observations about the nature of staff tenure in senators' offices over time .
the most recent publicly available senate staff compensation report , which provided some insight into the duration which congressional staff worked in a number of positions , was issued in 2006 , and relied on anonymous , self - reported survey data .
utilizing official salary expenditure data from the senate may provide more complete , robust findings than other methods of determining staff tenure , such as surveys ; the data presented here , however , are subject to some challenges that could affect the interpretation of the information presented .
no aggregate measure of individual congressional career length is provided in this report .
generalizations about staff tenure are limited in at least three potentially significant ways , including: the relatively brief period of time for which reliable , largely inclusive data are available in a readily analyzable form ; how the unique nature of congressional work settings might affect staff tenure ; and the lack of demographic information about staff for which tenure data are available .
