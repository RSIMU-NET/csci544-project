over the past 15 years , the u.s. current account has moved from a small surplus to a deficit that in 2005 was nearly $800 billion .
the final tally for 2006 has not been completed , but preliminary data suggests the deficit will grow to near $900 billion .
the size of this surplus has varied , hitting a low of $4 billion in 1998 and a high of $37 billion in 2003 , but over the past 25 years , the surplus has remained between $15 billion and $30 billion .
the net accumulation of liabilities through 2005 is $2.7 trillion , which is equivalent to about 22% of u.s. gdp .
the current account deficit has increased also as a share of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , climbing from near zero to a record 6.2% in 2005 .
the investment income balance is a tally of u.s. earnings on its foreign investments net of foreigners' earnings on their investments in the united states .
despite the huge increase in u.s. external debt , the investment income component of the current account has remained in surplus .
since 2003 , the surplus has fallen , reaching $28 billion in 2004 and $11 billion in 2005 .
because a current account deficit is a reflection of a concurrent net inflow of borrowed funds from the rest of the world , the accumulation of debt from a long succession of large annual deficits has caused the united states to move from being a small net creditor to the rest of the world to being a large net debtor .
does it suggest there is no reason for concern about u.s. international imbalances because its accumulated debt is economically costless ? .
a surplus in the investment income balance ( the u.s. earns more than it pays ) means that the united states , despite being a large net debtor on an accounting basis ( value of foreign liabilities exceeds value of foreign assets ) , is on an economic basis a net creditor .
therefore , the u.s. trade deficit and its consequences will continue to be legitimate matters of concern for economic policy makers .
it is reported as a component of the current account balance â€” the nation's most comprehensive measure of international transactions .
because the united states is generating net capital income receipts suggests that it is an economic net creditor to the rest of the world and is bearing no debt service cost on its large external debt .
the significance of this enduring surplus of investment income is that the united states , although a large net debtor , has been borrowing free of any economically meaningful debt service cost .
there is , however , an apparent paradox in u.s. international transactions in this period .
an economically significant debt would generate net capital income payments to the rest of the world , that is , a debt burden in the form of real resources being transferred to the rest of the world .
it is probably true that the valuation of u.s. external assets and liabilities is subject to measurement error .
even ignoring the likely bias associated with the reporting of retained earnings to compute the investment income balance , the likely pace of debt accumulation by the united states in conjunction with a likely future of higher world interest rates , suggests that the current investment income surplus will soon turn to deficit .
