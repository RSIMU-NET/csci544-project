my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) trends in degree attainment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , ( 2 ) trends in the levels of employment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , and ( 3 ) federal education programs intended to support the study of and employment in stem - related fields .
the health of the u.s. economy is directly tied to our science and technology industries , and the united states is a world leader in scientific and technological innovation .
these factors , concurrent with the nation's large and growing long - term fiscal imbalance , present significant and difficult challenges for policymakers as they tackle how best to ensure that our nation can continue to compete in the global marketplace .
concerns have been raised , however , about the nation's ability to maintain its technological competitive advantage , especially in light of other nations' investments in their own research infrastructures , the aging and changing u.s. workforce , and the fiscal challenges facing the nation .
from 1990 to 2003 , research and development expenditures outside the united states have more than doubled , from about $225 billion to over $500 billion .
since 1995 , for example , the united states has generated the largest share of high - technology manufacturing output of any country in the world .
for that report we ( 1 ) analyzed survey responses from 13 federal departments and agencies with stem education programs ; ( 2 ) analyzed data on students and graduates from the department of education's ( education ) national center for education statistics ( nces ) and on employees from the department of labor's ( labor ) bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) ; ( 3 ) interviewed educators and administrators at eight colleges and universities , federal agency officials , and representatives from associations and education organizations ; ( 4 ) conducted interviews via e - mail with 31 students from five universities we visited ; and ( 5 ) reviewed reports on various topics related to stem education and occupations .
further , as the united states becomes a more diverse society , minorities , in addition to women , will continue to represent a continuously increasing share of the workforce , yet women and minorities have tended to be underrepresented in stem education programs and career fields .
according to the census bureau , the median age of the u.s. population in 2004 was the highest it had ever been , and the growth of the labor force is expected to slow considerably , becoming negligible by 2050 .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss u.s. trends in the fields of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) in relation to the changing domestic and global economies .
for example , congress established national science and mathematics access to retain talent ( smart ) grants to encourage students from low - income families to enroll in stem fields and foreign languages critical to the national security of the united states .
