swaps and other over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives played a role in the 2007 — 2009 financial crisis in varying degrees and ways , as illustrated by the failure of lehman brothers holdings inc. ( lehman ) and the near failure of american international group , inc. ( aig ) .
to examine the costs or negative effects of the amended and original section 716 for u.s. banks and swap end - users , we reviewed the 2-year transition applications submitted by banks to the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) or the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) ; documentation on and materials related to the international swaps and derivatives association ( isda ) master agreement and credit support annex ; and reports addressing the implementation of section 716 published by consulting firms , credit rating agencies , and law firms .
according to fdic , the agency intends to maximize the use of private funding in a systemic resolution , and the law expressly prohibits taxpayer losses from the use of orderly liquidation authority .
to examine the banks' and taxpayers' risks associated with swap activities covered by the original section 716 , we reviewed the dodd - frank act's prudential and resolution reforms and related regulations ; publicly available regulatory filings submitted by u.s. banks registered as swap dealers or their parent holding companies , including annual or quarterly financial filings and resolution plans ; and industry , academic , and other studies or reports examining the role of derivatives in the 2007 — 2009 financial crisis and ways to mitigate risks posed by derivatives under the u.s. bankruptcy code .
proponents of the original section 716 sought to prohibit banks with access to federal assistance from engaging in riskier swap activities and to reduce the potential for the federal government , and therefore potentially taxpayers , to have to provide emergency assistance to banks engaging in such swap activities .
while the largest bank swap dealers supported amending section 716 to narrow its scope , other stakeholders held that the amendment could increase the risk of a bank needing federal assistance and could provide less protection to taxpayers .
importantly , fdic is authorized to transfer swaps and other qualified financial contracts to the bridge company or another solvent financial company .
since 2013 , fdic has been developing a spoe strategy to implement this authority .
in contrast , opponents of the provision maintained that swaps trading by banks did not significantly contribute to the 2007 — 2009 financial crisis .
before the act , the government generally had two options to address the potential failure of a systemically important bhc or other nonbank financial firm: ( 1 ) allow it to enter bankruptcy or ( 2 ) provide it with aid .
to examine the number of u.s. banks and the value of their swaps affected by the amended and original section 716 , we reviewed both versions of section 716 and relevant analyses prepared by the federal banking regulators , four large banks , selected law firms , and others .
in addition to section 716 , the dodd - frank act included other provisions to address , among other things , the financial stability risks associated with major financial companies and the swap market .
