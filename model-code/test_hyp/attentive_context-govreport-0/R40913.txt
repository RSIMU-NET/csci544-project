recognition of the implications of dependence on foreign sources of energy , coupled with concerns over the volatility of prices driven by fluctuations in supply spurred by world events , prompted federal efforts to increase u.s. energy independence and reduce domestic consumption .
for much of the nation's history , energy availability was not a concern as commerce and industry needs could be met by domestic supplies .
a major result has been the establishment of a number of programs focused on energy efficiency and conservation of domestic resources and on research programs that target the development of renewable sources of energy .
a few programs can also be found among the departments of the interior ( doi ) , labor ( dol ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) .
the department of energy ( doe ) operates the greatest number of efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs .
however , industrialization and population growth , and the continuing development of a consumer - oriented society , led to growing dependence on foreign sources of energy during the 20 th century to supplement the demands of a growing economy .
the department of the treasury and the department of agriculture ( usda ) operate several programs .
each program has been designed to meet current needs as well as future anticipated challenges .
each of those laws established , expanded , or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment ( rdd&d ) programs .
many of the current programs have been reauthorized and redesigned periodically to meet changing economic conditions and national interests .
assisted housing stability and energy and green retrofit investments program ( recovery act funded ) 2 .
this report outlines current federal programs and provisions providing grants , loans , loan guarantees , and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency , energy conservation , and renewable energy rdd&d .
the programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia , and from state and local governments to rural communities .
other program descriptions and some funding information were compiled from the database of state incentives for renewables and efficiency ( dsire ) , the assistance listings ( formerly the catalog of federal domestic assistance or cfda ) housed on the beta.sam.gov website , and the energy star website .

many of these programs have roots going back almost 40 years and have been redesigned many times over that period .
