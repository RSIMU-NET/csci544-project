i am here today to discuss our work on the nationwide problem of leaking underground storage tanks ( ust ) and the recommendations that we made to address this problem in our may 2001 report on the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) tank program .
because the states are primarily implementing the provisions of the program , we conducted a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia in the fall of 2000 to determine the extent to which tanks comply with program requirements , how epa and the states inspect tanks and enforce requirements , and whether upgraded tanks still leak .
to help states implement their programs , epa provides all states funding ( about $187,000 per state ) .
epa has authorized 32 states to implement the program with agency oversight and monitoring , while 16 states operate their own program under their own laws with limited epa oversight .
at the end of fiscal year 2002 , the fund had a balance of about $1.9 billion .
as you know , studies show that tanks leaking petroleum products and other hazardous substances contaminate the soil or water supplies and can pose health risks , such as nausea and kidney damage , as well as a costly cleanup burden .
since our original report , we have continued to examine and update epa program data and responses to our recommendations , along with other information .
we also suggested that the congress may want to ( 1 ) consider increasing the amount of funds it appropriates from the trust fund and allow states to spend a limited portion on inspections and enforcement , ( 2 ) authorize epa to require physical inspections of all tanks on a periodic basis , ( 3 ) authorize epa to prohibit fuel deliveries to non - compliant tanks , and ( 4 ) require states to adopt this enforcement authority .
this examination shows that while the agency has taken a number of corrective actions , the problems that we identified in may 2001 persist and have yet to be comprehensively resolved .
in 1984 , the congress created the ust program to protect the public from potential leaks from the more than 2 million operating tanks located across the nation , mostly at gas stations .
under the program , epa required tank owners to install new leak detection equipment by the end of 1993 and new spill - , overfill - , and corrosion - prevention equipment by the end of 1998 .
while epa has not yet set such inspection goals , it has been working with states to use third - party inspectors and other options to increase their inspection coverage .
in addition , epa retains direct authority over a small number of tanks primarily located on indian tribal lands .
in addition , in a june 2002 vermont department of environmental conservation survey of state funding programs , nine states reported that they did not have adequate funding to cover their current cleanup program costs .
in addition , 27 states lacked the authority to prohibit fuel deliveries to stations with problem tanks — one of the most effective tools for ensuring compliance with program requirements — and relied instead on issuing citations and fines to violators .
