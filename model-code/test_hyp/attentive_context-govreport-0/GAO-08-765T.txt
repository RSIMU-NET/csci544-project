to meet its expansive homeland security mission , dhs spends billions of dollars on service acquisitions for critical trade , transportation , and border security investments .
to help improve service acquisition outcomes , federal procurement policy calls for agencies to use a performance - based approach to the maximum extent practicable .
this report focused on contracts for major investments with complex service acquisitions at the coast guard , customs and border protection ( cbp ) , and the transportation security administration ( tsa ) — three of the dhs components reporting among the highest obligations for performance - based service acquisitions in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 .
in fact , more than 80 percent of dhs's total procurement dollars are spent on services .
while a performance - based approach has been widely accepted , we have found that agencies face certain challenges in implementing the approach — especially for complex or major investments .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) planning and assessment of its complex service acquisitions .
prior gao work has found that appropriate planning , structuring , and monitoring of acquisitions is critical to ensuring that the services provided meet the government's needs .
improving acquisition management has been an ongoing challenge since the department was established and requires sustained management attention .
these actions include routinely assessing requirements for complex investments to ensure that they are well - defined and developing consistently measurable standards linked to those requirements ; systematically evaluating outcomes of major investments and relevant contracting methods ; and improving the quality of fpds - ng data to facilitate identifying and assessing the use of various contracting methods .
other factors , such as pressure to get programs up and running , additional external requirements , and technological challenges also impact the ability to achieve good acquisition outcomes .
consistent with federal procurement policy , dhs has emphasized a performance - based approach to improve service acquisition outcomes .
specifically , i will discuss how contract outcomes are influenced by how well dhs components have defined and developed contract requirements and performance standards .
the report we are releasing today recommends that the secretary of homeland security take several actions to increase dhs's ability to achieve improved outcomes for its service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based .
moreover , the chief procurement officer ( cpo ) , who has responsibility for departmentwide procurement oversight , has begun some initial review of performance - based service acquisitions , but has not conducted systematic management assessments of this acquisition method .
if properly implemented , these characteristics can help ensure that contracted services meet cost , schedule , and performance requirements .
i will also discuss the need for improved assessment and oversight to ensure better outcomes .
this approach includes a performance work statement that describes outcome - oriented requirements , measurable performance standards , and quality assurance surveillance .
in managing its service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based , dhs has faced oversight challenges , including a lack of reliable data and systematic management reviews .
my testimony today will focus on the particular challenges dhs has confronted .
in addition , the cpo has implemented a departmentwide acquisition oversight program , which was designed with the flexibility to address specific procurement issues , such as performance - based service acquisitions , and is based on a series of component - level reviews .
