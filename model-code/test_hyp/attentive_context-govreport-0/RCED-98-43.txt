this report discusses various issues concerning the role of certain power marketing administrations ( pma ) and other federal agencies in restructuring electricity markets .
we examined whether the government operates them and the related electric power assets in a businesslike manner and identified options that the congress and other policymakers can pursue to address concerns about the pmas' role in restructuring markets and about their management .
the electricity industry has been predominantly monopolistic and noncompetitive .
although markets for wholesale transactions are becoming competitive , retail markets are still uncompetitive .
these options can be grouped in several different ways , including ( 1 ) improving the planning , budgeting , and funding for capital repairs of the federal hydropower assets ; ( 2 ) changing the pmas' power rates and repayment methodologies ; ( 3 ) organizationally restructuring the federal hydropower program to improve its operating efficiency ; and ( 4 ) eliminating the application of selected legal and administrative requirements to the federal program .
electricity markets are not yet fully competitive but are moving in that direction .
many options exist for improving the operations of the hydropower program while continuing federal ownership .
supporters of restructuring argue that markets will not be truly competitive until both wholesale and retail markets are transformed .
the direct debt , totaling over $53 billion , is owed directly to the federal government — for example , rus' borrowers owe about $32 billion .
the indirect debt , over $31 billion , is owed by the federal agencies to nonfederal parties — for example , tva owed about $24 billion to nonfederal bondholders .
federal power suppliers have also taken actions to become more competitive .
they face an uncertain future as electricity markets become increasingly competitive .
first , electrifying rural areas was an important goal of the federal power program ; however , this goal has been largely satisfied .
divest the federal hydropower assets .
those concerns could be satisfied only if the hydropower assets were fully divested ; however , improving their operations under federal ownership would better safeguard the federal investment while continuing to balance the existing multiple purposes of the projects .
in addition , other issues that need to be resolved include deciding ( 1 ) how stranded costs are to be recovered , ( 2 ) how electricity is to be transmitted in competitive markets , ( 3 ) how electricity is priced in these markets , and ( 4 ) how consumers at the retail level are to be offered a choice of power suppliers .
the nation's electricity markets are undergoing significant changes , as the previous chapters have shown .
because it was too expensive for ious to serve rural areas , federal power agencies provided power to those areas .
three broad options exist for addressing the federal hydropower program's operations: preserve the status quo of federal ownership .
the federal government has played a significant role in the development of electricity markets .
federal laws and regulations generally require that the pmas recover the full costs of producing and marketing federal hydropower .
after years of virtually no mergers , many mergers have been completed or proposed since the energy policy act was enacted in october 1992 .
