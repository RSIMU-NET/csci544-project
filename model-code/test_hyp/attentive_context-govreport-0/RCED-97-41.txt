specifically , they asked us to ( 1 ) identify fsa's efforts to treat minority farmers in the same way as nonminority farmers in delivering program services ; ( 2 ) examine the representation of minorities in county office staffing and on county committees in the counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers ; and ( 3 ) examine data on the disposition of minority and nonminority farmers' applications for participation in the agricultural conservation program ( acp ) and the direct loan program at the national level and in five county and five district loan offices .
for a number of years , minority farmers have expressed concern that u. s. department of agriculture ( usda ) officials do not treat them in the same way as nonminority farmers in the conduct of usda's programs , particularly in decisions made in the department's county offices and district loan offices .
because of this concern , the former chairman and ranking minority member requested in april 1996 that we review the efforts of the department's farm service agency ( fsa ) to conduct farm programs in an equitable manner .
more specifically , for african americans , fsa took 82 days ; for hispanic americans and native americans , 94 days ; and for asian americans , 97 days .
the county and district offices we visited were chosen because they had higher disapproval rates for minority farmers than for nonminority farmers for the acp and the direct loan program or because they were located in counties with high numbers of minority farmers .
to carry out its responsibilities , the staff ( 1 ) investigates farmers' complaints of discrimination in program decisions , ( 2 ) conducts management evaluations of fsa's field offices to ensure that procedures designed to protect civil rights are being followed , and ( 3 ) provides equal employment opportunity ( eeo ) and civil rights training to its employees .
fsa's management structure is highly decentralized ; the primary decision - making authority for approving loans and applications for a number of agricultural programs rests in its county and district loan offices .
nine were disapproved because of poor credit ratings or inadequate cash flow ; five were disapproved because the applicants did not meet eligibility criteria ; and one was disapproved because of insufficient collateral .
we did not , however , examine the processes used to investigate complaints of discrimination or the time this office takes to investigate and resolve farmers' complaints .
to identify fsa's efforts to achieve equitable treatment of minority farmers in the delivery of program services , we interviewed fsa officials and examined documents concerning the efforts of the civil rights and small business development staff .
within usda , fsa has the overall administrative responsibility for implementing agricultural programs .
fsa's efforts to achieve equitable treatment for minority farmers are overseen by the agency's civil rights and small business development staff .
in addition to these efforts , fsa recently increased its outreach activities to minority farmers to encourage their involvement in the department's programs , including their signing of 7-year production flexibility contracts .
fsa is responsible for , among other things , stabilizing farm income , helping farmers conserve environmental resources , and providing credit to new or disadvantaged farmers .
