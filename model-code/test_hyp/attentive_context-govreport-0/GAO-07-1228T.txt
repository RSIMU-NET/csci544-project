tens of thousands of people served as responders in the aftermath of the wtc disaster , including new york city fire department ( fdny ) personnel , federal government personnel , and other government and private - sector workers and volunteers from new york and elsewhere .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the implementation of federally funded health programs for individuals affected by the september 11 , 2001 , attack on the world trade center ( wtc ) .
six years after the destruction of the wtc buildings , concerns remain about the physical and mental health effects of the disaster , the long - term nature of some of these health effects , and the availability of health care services for those affected .
as you requested , i will discuss the status of ( 1 ) services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , ( 2 ) niosh's efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , and ( 3 ) niosh's awards to grantees for treatment services .
following the wtc attack , federal funding was provided to government agencies and private organizations to establish programs for screening , monitoring , or treating responders for illnesses and conditions related to the wtc disaster ; these programs are referred to in this testimony as the wtc health programs .
we also reported that the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , the component of hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) responsible for administering most of the wtc health programs , had begun to take steps to provide access to screening , monitoring , and treatment services for nonfederal responders who resided outside the new york city ( nyc ) metropolitan area .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) funded the programs as separate efforts serving different categories of responders — for example , firefighters , other workers and volunteers , or federal responders — and has responsibility for coordinating program efforts .
we reported that in august 2006 cdc had awarded $1.5 million from this appropriation to the fdny wtc medical monitoring and treatment program and almost $1.1 million to the new york / new jersey ( ny / nj ) wtc consortium for treatment - related activities .
in september 2006 we also testified that cdc had begun , but not completed , the process of allocating funding from a $75 million appropriation made in fiscal year 2006 for wtc health programs for responders .
hhs continues to fund and coordinate the wtc health programs and has key federal responsibility for ensuring the availability of services to responders .
hhs established the program in june 2003 , suspended it in march 2004 , and resumed it in december 2005 .
we interviewed officials from the hhs entities involved in administering and implementing the program: niosh and two hhs offices , the federal occupational health services ( foh ) and the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response ( aspr ) .
to assess the status of services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , we obtained and reviewed program data and documents from hhs , including applicable interagency agreements .
