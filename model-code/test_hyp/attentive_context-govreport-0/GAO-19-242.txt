 ( recommendation 13 ) .
the department of defense ( dod ) operates public industrial installations that maintain , overhaul , and repair its multitude of complex weapon systems and equipment .
the objectives of this report are to evaluate: 1 ) the condition of depot facilities and equipment , their relationship to depot performance , and the services' tracking of the relationship to depot performance ; and 2 ) the extent to which dod and the services have developed an approach for guiding depot investments to address key challenges .
finally , having regular reporting of progress will help ensure dod leadership and the congress have the information needed to help make critical funding and policy decisions .
to maintain these systems and equipment , dod uses a combination of private - sector contractors and public industrial installations that are government - owned and government - operated .
this mix of weapon systems and their maintenance needs is continually changing as new weapon systems replace older ones and systems in the field are modified with newer and better technologies .
in fiscal year 2007 , congress enacted a law requiring each military department to invest in the capital budgets of its depots no less than 6 percent of the average total dollar value of the combined maintenance , repair , and overhaul workload to its depots for the preceding 3 fiscal years .
dod annually requests appropriations from congress for investment in these depots and , from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2017 , the army , navy , air force , and marine corps have collectively invested over $13 billion in their depots .
for our first objective , we analyzed service reports and performance metrics for the 21 depots from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2017 .
improving readiness is one of dod's top priorities .
recognizing that existing depot facilities may not be ideally configured to efficiently and effectively support the services' readiness needs , senate report 115-262 , accompanying a proposed bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , included a provision directing the secretaries of the army , navy and air force to submit an engineering master plan for optimal placement and consolidation of facilities and major equipment , as well as an investment strategy addressing the facilities , major equipment and infrastructure requirements of depots under the jurisdiction of each service .
senate report 115-125 , accompanying a proposed bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2018 , included a provision for us to examine the investment in and performance of the service depots .
an approach focused on the implementation of efforts aimed at desired outcomes could better position dod and the services to make sustained progress .
dod has not developed a process to oversee the implementation of the services' depot optimization plans or provide reporting on depot investment effectiveness to dod decision makers and congress .
however , these reports do not inform congress about several key points , including whether the service depots are becoming more effective and efficient or the extent to which dod has managed to address depot investment backlogs .
reporting on progress towards desired outcomes also could assist in ensuring that there is accountability within the department for reversing years of decline and reaching the challenging goals set by the secretary of defense for improving mission capability rates and reducing operating and support costs .
