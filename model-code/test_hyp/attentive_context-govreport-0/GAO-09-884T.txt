as of october 2008 , there were more than 1.8 million women veterans in the united states ( representing approximately 7.7 percent of the total veteran population ) , and more than 102,000 of these women were veterans of the military operations in afghanistan and iraq , known as operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) .
i am pleased to be here today as the committee considers issues related to the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) delivery of health care services to women veterans .
historically , the vast majority of va patients have been men , but that is changing .
according to va data , in fiscal year 2008 , over 281,000 women veterans received health care services from va — an increase of about 12 percent since 2006 .
women veterans also need access to a range of mental health care services , such as care for depression .
women veterans seeking care at va medical facilities need access to a full range of physical health care services , including basic gender - specific services — such as breast examinations , cervical cancer screening , and menopause management — and specialized gender - specific services such as obstetric care ( which includes prenatal , labor and delivery , and postpartum care ) and treatment of reproductive cancers .
in addition , women veterans of oef / oif present new challenges for va's health care system .
looking ahead , va estimates that while the total number of veterans will decline by 37 percent between 2008 and 2033 , the number of women veterans will increase by more than 17 percent over the same period .
in my testimony today , i will discuss our preliminary findings , based on visits to selected va facilities , regarding ( 1 ) the on - site availability of health care services at va facilities for women veterans , ( 2 ) the extent to which va facilities are following va policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for women veterans , and ( 3 ) some key challenges that va facilities are experiencing in providing health care services for women veterans .
va data show that almost 20 percent of women veterans of oef / oif have been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) .
the health care services needed by women veterans are significantly different from those required by their male counterparts .
based on an analysis conducted by the va in 2007 , the estimated median age of women veterans was 47 , whereas the estimated median age of male veterans was 61 .
we used va data to select these sites based on several factors , including the number of women veterans using health care services at each vamc and whether facilities offered specific programs for women veterans , such as outpatient or residential treatment programs for women who have ptsd or have experienced military sexual trauma ( mst ) .
va's training programs cover five evidence - based psychotherapies: cognitive processing therapy ( cpt ) and prolonged exposure ( pe ) , which are recommended for ptsd ; cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) and acceptance and commitment therapy ( act ) , which are recommended for depression ; and social skills training ( sst ) , which is recommended for serious mental illness .
