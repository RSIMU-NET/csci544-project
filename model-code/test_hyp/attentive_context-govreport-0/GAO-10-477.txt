we provided a draft of this report to omb and the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) and housing and urban development ( hud ) .
to achieve our objectives , we selected six federal social services and housing grants from two federal agencies: the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) .
for example , the serve america act increases the limit on nonprofits' use of program funds for administrative costs from 5 to 6 percent for some federal education grant programs , and the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) makes $50 million available through the department of health and human services' strengthening communities fund to help build the capacity of nonprofit organizations .
our objectives were to provide information for selected federal grant programs and nonprofits on ( 1 ) how indirect cost terminology and classification vary , ( 2 ) how indirect costs are reimbursed , and ( 3 ) if gaps occur between indirect costs incurred and reimbursed , steps nonprofits take to bridge the gaps .
the selected grants are promoting safe and stable families ( pssf ) grant and family violence prevention and services / grants for battered women's shelters administered by hhs's administration for children and families ( acf ) , block grants for community mental health services and block grants for prevention and treatment of substance abuse administered by hhs's substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , and emergency shelter grants ( esg ) and housing opportunities for persons with aids grant ( hopwa ) administered by hud's office of community planning and development ( cpd ) .
as such , we have reported that nonprofits often struggle to cover the costs of doing business , which raises concerns about the long - term financial health and durability of the sector and its ability to effectively deliver federal services and programs .
the congressional research service ( crs ) estimates that government grants and payments to the nonprofit sector increased almost 53 percent from 1995 to 2005 , demonstrating governments' increased reliance on this sector to deliver public services .
responding to your request for more information on indirect cost reimbursement , especially when federal funding is passed through to nonprofits from other entities such as state and local governments , we reviewed , for selected federal grant programs and nonprofits , ( 1 ) how indirect cost terminology and classification vary , ( 2 ) how indirect costs are reimbursed , and ( 3 ) if gaps occur between indirect costs incurred and reimbursed , steps nonprofits take to bridge the gaps .
gao recommends that the director of omb bring together federal , state , and local governments , and nonprofit representatives to propose ways to clarify and improve understanding of how indirect costs should be treated , particularly for grants passed through state and local governments to nonprofits by clarifying the definitions of indirect costs and administrative costs and their relationship to each other and considering ways to help nonprofits improve their understanding and ability to better capture , categorize , report , and recover indirect and administrative costs .
