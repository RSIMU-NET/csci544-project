our review was limited to relevant provisions of the controlled substances act and implementing regulations , including department of justice , drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , and substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) regulations .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the regulation of methadone for pain management and addiction treatment , ( 2 ) the factors contributing to the increase in methadone - associated overdose deaths , and ( 3 ) the steps taken to prevent methadone - associated overdose deaths .
to examine the regulation of methadone for pain management and addiction treatment , we reviewed relevant codified federal statutes and regulations pertaining to the prescribing , administering , or dispensing of methadone for pain management and addiction treatment .
prescription drug abuse is a serious and growing public health problem .
drug overdoses , including those from prescription drugs , are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths in the united states , exceeded only by motor vehicle fatalities , according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .
methadone has been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) for the treatment of opioid addiction and pain , and it is relatively inexpensive compared to other opioids .
we interviewed officials from the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) and the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , and we reviewed relevant agency policies .
cdc has also reported that it has been difficult to determine the extent to which increases in methadone - associated overdose deaths have resulted from specific prescribing practices , misuse by patients , diversion of the drug such as by illegal sale , or other means .
hhs also reiterated that fda recently sent letters to the manufacturers of certain opioid drug products , including methadone , indicating that these drugs will be required to have a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of the drug continue to outweigh the risks .
however , prescription drug monitoring programs have limitations .
of particular concern is the sharp rise in methadone - associated overdose deaths â€” in which methadone may have caused or contributed to the death .
to examine the regulation of methadone for pain management and addiction treatment , we reviewed relevant provisions of the controlled substances act , implementing regulations , and federal case law .
we reviewed relevant studies and reports about efforts to prevent methadone and other prescription drug overdose deaths .
because many efforts under way to prevent methadone - associated overdose deaths are new , their effectiveness has not yet been evaluated .
states may also regulate the use of methadone for opioid addiction treatment under state laws and regulations , which may be equal to or stricter than federal standards .
such deaths can occur in a number of ways , including intentional overdoses , or suicide , and accidental overdoses due to improper dosing levels , abuse , or patient misuse , such as by combining methadone with other drugs .
until recently , methadone was primarily used in opioid treatment programs ( otp ) to treat and rehabilitate people addicted to such opioids as heroin or certain prescription drugs .
federal agencies have also begun educating the public about prescription drug abuse .
