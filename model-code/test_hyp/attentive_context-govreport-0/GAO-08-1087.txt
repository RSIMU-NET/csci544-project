the department of defense ( dod ) uses contractors to meet many of its logistical and operational support needs during combat operations and peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance missions .
according to dod , the scale and duration of global war on terrorism operations have required a significant increase in contractor support and in deployment of contractor personnel to areas such as iraq and afghanistan .
our reporting objectives are to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which costs for selected contracts supporting contingency operations increased and the factors causing the increases , ( 2 ) the extent to which dod provided oversight for selected contracts that support contingency operations , and ( 3 ) the reasons for the department's use of contractors to support contingency operations for the contracts we reviewed , as well as other contracts .
moreover , this reliance on contractors continues to grow , and dod has reported that future deployments of dod military forces are anticipated to require similar levels of support .
in its fiscal year 2007 report accompanying the dod appropriations bill , the house appropriations committee directed gao to examine the link between the growth in dod's operation and maintenance costs and , among other things , dod's increased reliance on service contracts .
in iraq , afghanistan , and throughout southwest asia , contractors provide deployed u.s. forces with communication services , interpreters who accompany military patrols , base operations support ( e.g. , food and housing ) , weapon systems maintenance , intelligence analysis , security services , and a variety of other support .
dod reported that contingency contract obligations for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 totaled nearly $44 billion .
to conduct our work , we selected and conducted a case study review of a nonprobability sample of 7 department of defense ( dod ) contracts for services that support deployed forces .
this report examines issues related to cost , oversight , and use of contractors to support contingency operations .
lack of effective oversight over the large number of contracts and contractors raises the potential for mismanagement of millions of dollars of these obligations .
in august 2008 , the congressional budget office reported that dod's fiscal years 2003 through 2007 contingency contract obligations for the iraq theater were $76 billion .
while these actions may enhance future contracting for expeditionary operations , they will not address potential problems with active contracts .
in may 2007 we reported that dod and service officials attributed the increased use of contractors for support services to several factors , including ( 1 ) increased operations and maintenance requirements from the global war on terror and other contingencies , which dod has met without an increase in active duty and civilian personnel ; ( 2 ) federal government policy , which is to rely on the private sector for needed commercial services that are not inherently governmental in nature ; and ( 3 ) dod initiatives , such as its competitive sourcing and utility privatization programs .
these criteria included: the contract supported deployed forces ; operations and maintenance ( o&m ) funds were used to pay for the contract services ; the principal place of performance was within central command's area of operation ; the contract was to maintain a weapons system ( s ) and / or provide support ; the contract was still in effect ; and the contractor was u.s. based .
