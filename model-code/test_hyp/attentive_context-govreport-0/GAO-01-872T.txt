over the last decade , the congress , the office of management and budget ( omb ) , and executive agencies have worked to implement a statutory framework to improve the performance and accountability of the executive branch and to enhance executive branch and congressional decisionmaking .
as agreed with the subcommittee , i will highlight how gpra can be used as a tool to assist the congress in oversight and decisionmaking and to help address the challenges facing the federal government in the 21st century .
my statement is based on our large body of work in recent years assessing gpra implementation and on strategic human capital management , as well as recent reports presenting the results of our survey of federal managers at 28 agencies and our analysis of human capital management discussions in agencies' fiscal year 2001 performance plans .
the issuance of agencies' fiscal year 2000 performance reports , in addition to updated strategic plans , annual performance plans , and the governmentwide performance plans , completes two full cycles of annual performance planning and reporting under gpra .
however , much work remains before this framework is effectively implemented across the government , including transforming agencies' organizational cultures to improve decisionmaking and strengthen performance and accountability .
as a result of this framework , there has been substantial progress in the last few years in establishing the basic infrastructure needed to create high - performing federal organizations .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) .
this framework includes as its core elements financial management and information technology reforms as well as results - oriented management legislation , especially gpra .
moreover , we are now moving to a more difficult but more important phase of gpra implementation , that is , using results - oriented performance information as a routine part of agencies' day - to - day management , and congressional and executive branch decisionmaking .
the cornerstone of federal efforts to successfully meet current and emerging public demands is to adopt a results orientation ; that is , to develop a clear sense of the results an agency wants to achieve as opposed to the products and services ( outputs ) an agency produces and the processes used to produce them .
major management challenges and program risks confronting agencies continue to undermine the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of federal programs .
such goals should be included particularly for problems whose resolution is mission - critical , or which could potentially impede achievement of performance goals .
the performance information produced by gpra's planning and reporting infrastructure can help build a government that is better equipped to deliver economical , efficient , and effective programs that can help address the challenges facing the federal government .
omb has required that agencies' annual performance plans include performance goals for resolving their major management problems .
virtually all of the results that the federal government strives to achieve require the concerted and coordinated efforts of two or more agencies .
this transformation is not an easy one and requires investments of time and resources as well as sustained leadership commitment and attention .
there are over 40 program areas across the government , related to a dozen federal mission areas , in which our work has shown that mission fragmentation and program overlap are widespread , and that crosscutting federal program efforts are not well coordinated .
