delegations from more than 190 countries and regions meet from november 28 to december 9 , 2011 , in durban , south africa , to continue discussions of how to address climate change under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) .
the year 2012 will mark both the 20 th anniversary of the opening for signature of the unfccc ( in rio de janeiro , 1992 ) and the end of the first "commitment period" ( 2008-2012 ) of the unfccc's subsidiary kyoto protocol .
the preceding 20 years have witnessed expanding evidence of many aspects of human - related , greenhouse gas ( ghg ) - induced climate change .
however , many questions regarding the magnitude , timing , and local characteristics of natural and human - induced climate change will likely persist for decades .
congress remains divided over the stance the united states should take in the international climate change negotiations .
the u.s. congress has taken up , but never enacted , legislation specifically addressing mitigation of u.s. ghg emissions , and has not fully funded requests by presidents clinton , ( george w. ) bush , or obama to support their pledges of financial support for deployment of low - emitting technology and other assistance to low - income countries .
the 1992 unfccc treaty was formulated as a framework to facilitate mutual movement of all countries in this process , to increase effectiveness , and to ameliorate possible adverse effects on competitiveness .
although some observers hope that the durban negotiations will overcome this hurdle by producing a mandate for quantitative , legally binding ghg obligations for all countries , others wonder whether the unfccc process will be able to maintain momentum even on narrower objectives , such as rules for new processes and mechanisms for finance , technology deployment , and adaptation .
the unfccc was also created to help avoid a problem of "free riders" ( in which some benefit by the efforts of others while not taking comparable actions themselves ) .
a large majority of countries now consider climate change to be a primary impetus to restructuring their energy sectors — and economies more broadly — toward more efficient and less climate - vulnerable models .
in this context of strongly held differences within the united states , and between the united states and most other countries , the durban conference will tackle questions of the future of the kyoto protocol and the possibility of a mandate for future quantitative , binding ghg obligations for all parties .
parties to the kyoto protocol were due to conclude negotiations for a second commitment period by 2007 ; unable to do so , parties agreed to a two - track negotiating mandate: one to extend the kyoto protocol , and the other to include all parties ( including the united states ) , called the bali action plan .
many international stakeholders doubt the policy stasis of the united states can be overcome in the next few years ; instead of looking to u.s. leadership , some observers now counsel the u.s. delegation to "get out of the way. .
the breadth of views may be characterized by contrasting two recent remarks by members: on the one hand , there is the call from representative bobby l. rush: "ambitious and urgent action to help poor countries and communities confront climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here in the [united states] is both a moral imperative and in our national interest. .
