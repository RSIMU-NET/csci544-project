the following definition is used by some science and technology policy analysts as a cornerstone of thinking about science and technology ( s&t ) policy decisionmaking: [science and technology policy] is concerned with the allocation of resources for scientific research and technical development .
it includes government encouragement of science and technology as the roots of strategy for industrial development and in economic growth ; but it also includes the use of science in connection with problems of the public sector .
these differences include the rapidity of change in science and technology ; novelty of many issues in science and technology ; scale , complexity , and interdependence among technologies ; irreversibility of many scientific and technological effects ; public worries about real or imagined threats to human health and safety ; and the challenges to deeply held social values .
scientific and technical knowledge and guidance influences many of today's public policies .
for example , federal decisionmaking regarding nuclear power includes nuclear regulatory commission - safety and design ; federal power commission - rate bases and authority ; occupational safety & health administration - worker safety ; environmental protection agency - environmental impact studies ; department of energy - nuclear power research and development ; federal emergency management agency - nuclear power plant emergency ; department of homeland security , federal bureau of investigation , federal aviation administration , u.s. coast guard , and others - nuclear power plant security ; and department of transportation - shipment of radioactive materials .
because science and technical knowledge and guidance influences public policy decisionmaking on many other issues , some think that science and technology policy does not need to be a separate field of inquiry .
others , however , view s&t policy as different from other public policy issue areas .
this section also discusses different perspectives on federal funding of research ; policy for science and science for policy ; and policy for technology and technology for policy .
at the request of president washington , congress passed its first science and technology policy - related act , regarding patents , in 1790 .
because of the close association of basic research with higher education , this aspect of science [and technology] policy is difficult to separate from overall educational policy and from [scientific and] technical [workforce] policy .
this report will provide a basic understanding of science and technology policy including the nature of s&t policy , how scientific and technical knowledge is useful for public policy decisionmaking , and an overview of the key stakeholders in science and technology policy .
these actions led to today's patent and trademark office ( pto ) .
despite these challenges , scientific and technical knowledge and advice has the potential of being useful in making decisions related to public policy .
congress makes decisions regarding all four of the s&t policy facets described earlier: science for policy , technology for policy , policy for science , and policy for technolog y .
science and technology policy decisionmaking is both democratic and decentralized .
science and technology policy issues tend to reach the presidential level if they involve multiple agencies ; have budgetary , economic , national security , or foreign policy dimensions ; or are highly visible to the public .
