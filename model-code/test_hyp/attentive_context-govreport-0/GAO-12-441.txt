to assess the progress agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended proliferation security initiative ( psi ) policies and procedures , and issuing required annual reports , we reviewed the findings and recommendations in gao's 2006 and 2008 reports on psi and the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( the 9 / 11 act ) .
the u.s. government issued the national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction in 2002 , and the proliferation of wmd , such as nuclear - or missile - related goods or technology , remains one of today's key challenges to international security .
for almost 10 years , the united states has been actively participating in the proliferation security initiative ( psi ) to assist in u.s. efforts to break up black markets , detect and intercept weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) materials in transit , and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade .
specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) the progress relevant agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended psi policies and procedures and issuing required annual reports ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which psi activities have enhanced and expanded u.s. counterproliferation efforts .
following our report , congress passed the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( the 9 / 11 act ) , in which it expresses its sense that relevant agencies and departments take actions to expand and strengthen psi , including establishing clear psi policies and procedures and performance indicators to measure the results of psi activities .
the 9 / 11 act also required dod and state to submit annual psi reports and mandated gao to assess and report periodically on psi's effectiveness , including progress made in implementing the law's provisions .
to assess how psi activities have enhanced and expanded u.s. efforts to prevent the flow of wmd materials and to determine what actions , if any , agencies have taken to develop indicators of psi's success , we reviewed and analyzed documents from dod , state , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the department of justice ( doj ) .
according to the department of state ( state ) , psi's objective is to enhance and expand u.s. efforts to prevent the flow of wmd , their delivery systems , and related materials on the ground , in the air , and at sea , to and from states and nonstate actors of proliferation concern .
in may 2003 , president bush announced psi , a multinational effort , including the united states , to focus on building wmd interdiction capabilities by endorsing the statement of interdiction principles .
we also requested and reviewed annual reports submitted to congress by state and the department of defense ( dod ) and analyzed them for compliance with the requirements in the 9 / 11 act .
this report updates and provides information on the to assess what agencies have done since 2008 to establish recommended psi policies and procedures and issue required annual reports , we reviewed the findings and recommendations in gao's 2006 and 2008 reports on psi and the congressional mandate .
develop a framework for measuring psi activities' results , including performance measures where possible that help link the results to psi's objective .
