the current economic downturn has added to the significant financial stress facing that industry .
congress has asked us to review these plans .
deteriorating financial , real estate , and labor markets have reduced consumer confidence and available credit , and automobile purchases have declined .
after reaching a recent high of about 1.8 million in july 2005 , the number of vehicles sold in the united states dropped to about 800,000 in october 2008 , approximately a 54 percent decline .
in deciding whether to provide financial assistance , congress must consider and balance the perceived need for expedience with the need to put a structure in place to ensure that the interests of taxpayers are safeguarded and the specific problems that have put the industry in its current financial crisis are addressed .
these principles are ( 1 ) identifying and defining the problem , ( 2 ) determining the national interests and setting clear goals and objectives that address the problem , and ( 3 ) protecting the government's interests .
less than three days ago , the big 3 submitted business plans to congress that describe their requests for federal assistance and restructuring plans .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on possible federal assistance to the domestic auto industry .
the tightening of the credit markets has also affected the big 3 and their suppliers , which together employ about 730,000 people .
officials from the big 3 have requested immediate federal financial assistance , reporting that their companies are experiencing significant financial stress .
while most auto manufacturers have experienced declining sales in 2008 , recent economic conditions have particularly hurt sales of the “big 3” domestic auto manufacturers ( general motors , ford , and chrysler ) , in part because these companies have historically derived most of their sales from vehicles such as sport utility vehicles , which are less fuel efficient , but more profitable than small cars .
in addition to potential job losses at auto manufacturers , the collapse or partial collapse of the domestic auto industry would adversely affect auto dealers , suppliers , and other sectors .
if congress determines that the benefits of federal intervention exceed those of bankruptcy reorganization for one or more of the domestic manufacturers , congress could draft legislation to guide the availability and use of federal assistance .
higher gasoline prices over the past several years , which rose to over $4 per gallon in the summer of 2008 before falling steeply this fall , have contributed to a sharp decline in consumer demand for these vehicles .
my remarks are based on our extensive body of work on previous federal financial assistance efforts that dates back to the 1970s , including those efforts directed to individual large corporations , such as the chrysler corporation and lockheed aircraft corporation , as well as municipalities and commercial aviation .
in my statement today , i will discuss principles that could serve as a framework for considering the desirability , nature , scope , and conditions of possible federal financial assistance and , should congress decide to provide financial assistance , how these principles could be applied in these circumstances .
determine national interests and set clear goals and objectives that address the problem: after defining the problem , congress must determine whether a legislative solution best serves the national interest .
