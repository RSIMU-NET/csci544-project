this report examines ( 1 ) the general state of the science regarding geoengineering approaches and their potential effects ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the federal government is sponsoring or participating in geoengineering research or deployment ; and ( 3 ) the views of legal experts and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering activities , and associated challenges , if any , to geoengineering governance .
gao recommends that the appropriate entities within the executive office of the president ( eop ) , such as the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , in consultation with relevant federal agencies , develop a clear , defined , and coordinated approach to geoengineering research in the context of a federal strategy to address climate change that ( 1 ) defines geoengineering for federal agencies ; ( 2 ) leverages existing resources by having federal agencies collect information and coordinate federal research related to geoengineering in a transparent manner ; and if the administration decides to establish a formal geoengineering research program , ( 3 ) sets clear research priorities to inform decision - making and future governance efforts .
changes in the earth's climate attributable to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases may have significant environmental and economic effects within the united states and internationally .
our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the general state of the science regarding geoengineering approaches and their potential effects ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the federal government is sponsoring or participating in geoengineering research or deployment ; and ( 3 ) the views of legal experts and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering activities , and associated challenges , if any , to geoengineering governance .
global change research program ( usgcrp ) had begun to develop governmentwide strategies to address adaptation and reduce the nation's vulnerability to adverse impacts from climate change .
in its recent study advancing the science of climate change , the national research council ( nrc ) stated that temperature increases related to rising greenhouse gas levels are closely associated with a broad spectrum of climate impacts , such as changes in rainfall and widespread ocean acidification .
we also met with federal officials from the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the department of state ( state ) to collect their views on the applicability of domestic laws and international agreements to geoengineering , and governance challenges , if any .
these effects are expected to vary across regions , countries , and economic sectors .
even if policymakers decide that geoengineering should not be pursued domestically , knowledge of geoengineering approaches and their potential effects will be essential to inform international negotiations regarding other countries' consideration of , or actions related to , geoengineering research and deployment .
these impacts pose significant risks for — and in many cases are already affecting — a wide range of human and environmental systems , including freshwater resources , the coastal environment , agriculture , fisheries , human health , ecosystems , and national security , according to the study .
however , many countries with significant greenhouse gas emissions , including the united states , china , and india , have not committed to binding limits on co emissions , and atmospheric co in particular , we reported that federal entities such as the president's council on environmental quality ( ceq ) , the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , and the u.s .
