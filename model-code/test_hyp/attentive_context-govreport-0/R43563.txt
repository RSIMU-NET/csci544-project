many decisions the senate makes — from routine requests for additional debate time , to determinations of how legislation will be considered on the floor — are arrived at by unanimous consent .
senate rules , procedures , and precedents give significant parliamentary power to individual senators during the course of chamber deliberations .
many hold requests take the form of a letter addressed to the majority or minority leader ( depending on the party affiliation of the senator placing the hold ) expressing reservations about the merits or timing of a particular policy proposal or nomination .
efforts to modify the original request may be undertaken — a process that can require extensive negotiations between and among senate leaders and their colleagues — but there is no guarantee that a particular objection can be addressed to the satisfaction of all senators .
the senate hold emerges from within this context of unanimous - consent decision - making as a method of transmitting policy or scheduling preferences to senate leaders regarding matters available for floor consideration .
when a unanimous consent request is proposed on the floor , any senator may object to it .
with hold - inspired negotiations underway , the senate can turn its attention to more broadly - supported matters .
unless the target of a hold is of considerable importance to the majority leader and a supermajority of his colleagues — 60 of whom might be required to invoke cloture on legislation under senate rule xxii — the most practical course of action is often to lay the matter aside and attempt to promote negotiations that could alleviate the concerns that gave rise to the hold .
if objection is heard , the consent request does not take effect .
more often than not , senate leaders — as agents of their party responsible for defending the political , policy , and procedural interests of their colleagues — honor a hold request because not doing so could trigger a range of parliamentary responses from the holding senator ( s ) , such as a filibuster , that could expend significant amounts of scarce floor time .
the senate has considered a variety of proposals targeting the senate hold in recent years , two of which the chamber adopted .
as such , efforts to regulate holds are inextricably linked with the chamber's use of unanimous consent agreements to structure the process of calling up measures and matters for floor debate and amendment .
a second challenge to hold regulation involves the nature of the transmission itself .
senate holds are predicated on the unanimous consent nature of senate decision - making .
an example of a hold letter is displayed in appendix a .
accordingly , rather than restricting the process itself , recent attempts to alter the operation of holds have focused on making the secrecy of holds less absolute .
as agents of their party , senate leaders value the information that holds provide regarding the policy and scheduling preferences of their colleagues .
while not all holds are intended to prevent the consideration of a particular measure , some do take that form , and senate leaders justifiably perceive those correspondences as implicit filibuster threats .
until recently , many holds were considered a nonymous ( or secret ) because the source and contents of the request were not made available to the public , or even to other senators .
