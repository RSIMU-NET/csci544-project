concerned by reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act ( fisma ) of 2002 , which permanently authorized and strengthened information security program , evaluation , and annual reporting requirements for federal agencies .
in my testimony today , i will summarize ( 1 ) security incidents reported at federal agencies , ( 2 ) the effectiveness of information security at federal agencies , ( 3 ) agencies' reported progress in performing key control activities , and ( 4 ) opportunities to enhance fisma reporting and independent evaluations .
we also analyzed agencies' inspectors general ( ig ) reports pertaining to information security ; congressional reports ; annual fisma reports for 24 major federal agencies ; the performance and accountability reports for those agencies ; and the office of management and budget ( omb ) fisma guidance and mandated annual reports to congress .
the need for a vigilant approach to information security is demonstrated by the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents , the wide availability of hacking tools , and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology .
information security is a critical consideration for any organization that depends on information systems and computer networks to carry out its mission or business .
proper safeguards are essential to protect systems from malicious insiders and external attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access and obtain sensitive information , commit fraud , disrupt operations , or launch attacks against other systems .
in reports to congress since 1997 , we have identified information security as a governmentwide high - risk issue .
over the past year , federal agencies have reported numerous security incidents .
it is especially important for government agencies , where the public's trust is essential .
for many years , we have reported that poor information security is a widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences .
security plans ) .
thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's joint hearing to discuss information security over federal systems .
in preparing for this testimony , we relied on our previous reports and ongoing work on information security at federal agencies .
despite these persistent weaknesses , agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements .
periodic reporting of performance measures for fisma requirements and related analysis provides valuable information on the status and progress of agency efforts to implement effective security management programs ; however , opportunities exist to enhance reporting under fisma and the independent evaluations completed by igs .
almost all major agencies exhibit weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls .
remedial actions to address deficiencies in information security policies , procedures , and practices igs reported weaknesses in their agency's remediation process .
current performance measures offer limited assurance of the quality of agency processes that implement key security policies , controls , and practices .
until agencies effectively and fully implement agencywide information security programs , federal data and systems will not be adequately safeguarded to prevent disruption , unauthorized use , disclosure , and modification .
despite having persistent information security weaknesses , federal agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements .
