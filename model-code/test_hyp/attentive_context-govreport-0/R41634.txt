for activities funded through the annual appropriations process ( referred to as discretionary spending ) , congress differentiates between authorizations and the appropriations .
both the house and senate have internal rules encouraging the separation of money and policy decisions .
under the rules of the house and senate , legislative provisions and appropriations for purposes not authorized by law typically may not be included in appropriations measures .
as currently provided in house rule xxi , the house bars legislative provisions from being reported in general appropriations bills ; amendments to general appropriations bills containing language that would add to or alter existing law are also prohibited .
these rules are enforced on the house and senate floor through points of order , but if legislative provisions are enacted as a part of an appropriations measure , they have the full force of the law .
limitations within appropriations measures are provisions that negatively restrict the amount , purpose , or availability of funds without changing existing law .
although house and senate rules restrict legislating on appropriations , policy matters may be included through limitation provisions .
authorizations comprise substantive law establishing government entities , activities , or programs , while appropriations provide budget authority to fund government agencies or programs by allowing them to obligate funds .
these rules stem from the principle that the process through which the activities of government are chosen should be distinct from the process through which those activities are funded .
the effect of these provisions is to limit the actions for which funds may be used through the capping or outright denial of funds for specific purposes .
these rules were formally established in both chambers during the mid - 1800s to address concerns with delays in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of extraneous legislative matters that tended to provoke controversy .
the goal of this report is to clarify aspects of the legislative process concerning the inclusion of limitations in appropriations measures under the rules of the house and senate .
clause 5 of house rule xxii also prohibits the inclusion of legislative language in conference reports that accompany appropriations acts .
proper limitations are distinct from legislative provisions because they do not have the effect of either making new law or changing existing law .
senate rule xvi additionally restricts legislative language not contained within existing law from being added via amendment to a general appropriations bill , unless it is determined to be germane to a legislative provision previously added by the house .
in more recent years , as the precedents regarding limitations have become more nuanced , parliamentary determinations of legislative language have stemmed from a number of principles related to the imposition of new duties upon the recipient of funds , changes in agency discretion , or whether the provision mandates action contrary to law .
the allowability of limitations under the rules of the house and senate is based upon the principle that although congress may authorize an activity , it is under no obligation to fund that activity .
the distinction between legislative provisions and funding limitations has been developed and refined over time based on various rulings that establish what types of provisions are allowable .
as a result , limitation provisions , which define the purposes for which budget authority may not be used without also affecting a recipient's discretion under other laws , have frequently been included within the text of appropriations bills reported by the committee or added by amendments on the floor .
