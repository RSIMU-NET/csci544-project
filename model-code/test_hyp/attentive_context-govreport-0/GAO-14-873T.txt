congress gave fsoc a number of significant authorities to help it execute its broad mission , including designating nonbank financial companies for heightened supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) .
in response to the crisis , in 2010 congress passed the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) , which provided for a broad range of regulatory reforms .
as you know , the 2007-2009 financial crisis focused attention on weaknesses in the u.s. regulatory structure , including the lack of an agency or mechanism responsible for monitoring and addressing risks across the financial system and a shortage of timely information to facilitate that oversight .

the dodd - frank act also created the office of financial research ( ofr ) , in part , to support fsoc by providing financial research and data .
among other things , the act established fsoc to monitor the stability of the u.s. financial system and take actions to mitigate risks that might destabilize the system .
our past work has shown that the lack of clear roles and coordination can lead to duplication , confusion , and regulatory gaps .
we will continue to monitor fsoc's progress in implementing our recommendations and stand ready to assist congress as it continues its oversight of these entities .
specifically , in our 2012 report we reviewed fsoc's challenges in achieving its mission , efforts to establish management mechanisms , activities for supporting collaboration among their members and external stakeholders , and its processes for issuing reports and rules and made nine recommendations to fsoc for improving its ability to identify systemic risk and emerging threats , its transparency and accountability , and collaboration and coordination across members and member agencies.in my comments today , i will discuss fsoc's progress in addressing these recommendations .
fully addressing our recommendations will help shed more light on fsoc's decision making and activities and allow congress to hold the council accountable for results .
thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) .
addressing our recommendations can also help fsoc enhance collaboration among its members and with external stakeholders that are critical to their ability to achieve their missions .
however , further efforts continue to be needed , including fully implementing our september 2012 recommendations .
we have ongoing work reviewing duplication , overlap , and fragmentation in the financial regulatory structure and as part of that work will be reviewing the various roles and responsibilities of federal agencies that oversee risks to financial stability .
