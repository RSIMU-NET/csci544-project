in 1997 , almost 900,000 children younger than 18 received about $5 billion in supplemental security income ( ssi ) benefits .
in february 1997 , the social security administration ( ssa ) published regulations to implement the new definition of disability for the ssi children's program set forth in the welfare reform law .
the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( p.l .
104-193 ) , commonly referred to as welfare reform , made eligibility for childhood ssi benefits more restrictive .
in september 1997 , we reported that ssa's regulations establishing a new severity standard are consistent with the law and are well supported.since then , we have been monitoring ssa's adjudication of cases under the new regulations for 288,000 children whose eligibility was subject to review against the new standard as well as for about 370,000 new applicants .
under the more restrictive standard , a child's impairment generally must result in marked limitations in two areas of functioning or an extreme limitation in one area .
previously , a child could be found eligible if his or her impairment resulted in one marked and one moderate limitation or three moderate limitations .
you asked us to expand on our early findings regarding ssa's implementation of the new eligibility standard , which we reported to you and the chairman of the social security subcommittee in a joint hearing on march 12 , 1998 .
ssa has made substantial progress in implementing the new childhood definition of disability through its rapid redetermination of most of these cases , its action to ensure that the redetermination process is fair , and its ongoing review of the implementation of the new regulations .
the congress made the eligibility criteria for children to receive ssi more restrictive in order to help ensure that only needy children with severe disabilities are eligible for benefits .
examples of such functional criteria include standards for assessing a child's social skills ; cognition and communication skills ; and the ability to concentrate , keep pace , and persist at tasks at hand .
this growth occurred after ssa initiated outreach efforts and issued two sets of regulations that made the eligibility criteria for children less restrictive , particularly for children with mental impairments .
one regulatory change , issued in december 1990 , revised and expanded ssa's medical listings for childhood mental impairments by adding such impairments as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and incorporating functional criteria into the listings .
the plan includes special initiatives to ensure the quality of cases readjudicated in response to the top - to - bottom review , as well as initiatives to improve ssa's ongoing quality assurance reviews on childhood cases .
ssa found problems with the adjudication of claims for which mental retardation was the primary impairment as well as potential procedural weaknesses relating to notification of appeal rights and termination of benefits for failure to cooperate with ssa requests for information needed to redetermine eligibility .
ssa also needs to continue its efforts to improve decisionmaking for childhood cases to better ensure that adjudicators apply the new eligibility criteria accurately and consistently .
from the end of 1989 through 1996 , the number of children younger than 18 receiving ssi had more than tripled , from 265,000 to 955,000 .
