the 111 th congress continues to take a strong interest in the health of the u.s. research and development ( r&d ) enterprise and in providing sustained support for federal r&d activities .
its purposes include addressing specific concerns such as national defense , health , safety , the environment , and energy security ; advancing knowledge generally ; developing the scientific and engineering workforce ; and strengthening u.s. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy .
the united states government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering research and development .
the federal government has played an important role in supporting r&d efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies , from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease .
in may 2009 , president obama requested $147.620 billion for r&d in fy2010 , a 0.4% increase over the enacted fy2009 r&d funding level of $147.065 billion ( est. ) .
 ( not including fy2009 r&d funding provided under the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l .
110-69 ) and president bush's american competitiveness initiative ( aci ) .
most of the r&d funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of the funding agencies .
the president's proposed fy2010 r&d funding included an emphasis on increasing funding for the physical sciences and engineering , an effort consistent with the intent of the america competes act ( p.l .
as a result of these and other factors , the r&d agency figures reported by the white house office of management and budget ( omb ) and white house office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) ( and shown in table 1 ) may differ somewhat from the agency budget analyses that appear later in this report .
increasing direct federal r&d funding by 12.5% in fy2010 would have required an increase of more than $18 billion above president obama's request .
111-5 ) ) .
another complicating factor for fy2009 and fy2010 is the inclusion of funding for r&d , facilities , and equipment , and related activities in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .
 , analysis of federal r&d funding is complicated by several factors , including the obama administration's omission of congressionally directed spending from the fy2010 budget request and inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of r&d .
111-5 brings total fy2009 r&d funding to $165.400 billion .
based on 2007 figures , reaching president obama's 3% goal would require a 12.5% real increase in national r&d funding .
more broadly , in a speech before members of the national academy of sciences , president obama put forth a goal of increasing the national investment in r&d to more than 3% of the u.s. gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
in addition , advocates for increased federal r&d funding — including president obama's science advisor , john holdren — have raised concerns about the potential negative effects of a "boom - bust" approach to federal r&d funding , i.e. , rapid growth in federal r&d funding followed by much slower growth , flat funding , or even decline .
