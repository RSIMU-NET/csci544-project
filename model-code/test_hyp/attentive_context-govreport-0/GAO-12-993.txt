in response to your interest in a report on the repealed ctaa program and , more specifically , on how eda awarded the ctaa grants and how those grants fit in with other eda grant programs , we examined the ctaa program to determine ( 1 ) how eda made grant award decisions , ( 2 ) what mechanisms eda established to monitor the grants and evaluate their effectiveness , and ( 3 ) how the ctaa program compared with other eda community grant programs .
the trade and globalization adjustment assistance act of 2009 ( tgaaa ) , passed as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act in february 2009 , reauthorized and amended trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) programs that assist trade - impacted workers , farmers and fishermen , firms , community colleges , and communities .
for fiscal year 2010 , the department of commerce's economic development administration ( eda ) awarded $36.8 million in ctaa grants to 36 communities to develop a strategic plan to help the community adjust to trade impacts and to promote economic diversification or to implement programs and projects as part of a strategic plan .
commerce also provided further information on planned improvements to eda's performance measures .
the administration proposed to discontinue the program , contending that eda could provide similar assistance to communities at a lower cost through its economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) program .
from 2001 to 2011 , u.s. imports of goods and services almost doubled from $1.4 trillion to $2.7 trillion .
we also reviewed a nonprobability sample of 12 grant files , selected to provide a variety of grant awards on the basis of region , grant amount , and grant type ( i.e. , whether the purpose of the grant was to help a community develop a strategic plan or implement part of an existing strategic plan ) .
the tgaaa reestablished the taa for communities programs , including the community trade adjustment assistance ( ctaa ) program and two other programs .
in late june 2009 , congress appropriated $40 million in funding for the ctaa program .
the federal government has recognized that , although the benefits of free trade are widely dispersed across the economy , worker dislocation can have an adverse effect on communities .
the increase in imports and the ongoing trade liberalization have resulted in the loss of certain u.s. jobs , as companies that cannot compete with lower priced imports have closed or relocated to lower wage countries .
we also interviewed eda regional officials regarding their grant monitoring practices and how they plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the program .
congress responded by repealing the ctaa program in 2012 .
as noted above , the administration proposed to discontinue the ctaa program in 2012 , contending that eda could provide similar assistance to communities at a lower cost through its eaa program ( see table 4 for more on the funding of these programs ) .
to determine how eda made grant award decisions , we reviewed relevant laws , guidance , and regulations .
tgaaa mandated that we report on the operation and effectiveness of the amended taa programs .
to determine how commerce made grant award decisions , we reviewed relevant laws and regulations , the ctaa federal funding opportunity , and grant files .
