significant funding increases are also planned , which would bring the fiscal year 2003 munitions budget to over $10 billion .
in september and october of 2001 , congress provided emergency funding of $1.3 billion for munitions , with a supplemental increase in the fiscal year 2002 munitions budget of $397 million .
the department of defense planned to spend about $7.9 billion on acquiring munitions in fiscal year 2002 .
since 1994 , the department of defense inspector general and gao have issued numerous reports identifying weaknesses and expressing concerns about the accuracy of the process used by the department to determine munitions requirements .
accordingly , this review was undertaken , pursuant to gao's legislative authority , to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) improvements have been made to the department of defense's munitions requirements determination process and ( 2 ) the process is being used to guide current munitions acquisitions .
ongoing military operations associated with the global war on terrorism have heightened concerns about the unified combatant commands having sufficient quantities of munitions .
the department expected that its efforts to improve the munitions requirements process should correct over - or understated requirements and provide the combatant commands with needed munitions .
our april 2001 report discussed steps being taken by the department to improve the process and additional actions still needed .
in response to that report , the department outlined actions underway that address all aspects of the report's recommendations .
notwithstanding the improvements the department said it would make to the munitions requirements determination process , combatant commands have continued to report munitions shortages .
the department of defense concurred with the recommended linkage of munitions requirements and combatant commanders' needs .
the department of defense's budget is the product of a complex process designed to develop an effective defense strategy that supports u.s. national security objectives .
in april 2001 , we reported continuing problems with the capabilities - based munitions requirements determination process because the department ( 1 ) had yet to complete a database providing detailed descriptions of the types of targets on large enemy installations that would likely be encountered , based on warfighting scenarios ; ( 2 ) had not set a time frame for completing its munitions effectiveness database ; and ( 3 ) was debating whether to include greater specificity in its warfighting scenarios and to rate the warfighting scenarios by the probability of their occurrence .
other munitions requirements are also determined , and include munitions needed ( 1 ) for forces not committed to support combat operations , ( 2 ) for forward presence and current operations , ( 3 ) to provide a post - theater of war combat capability , and ( 4 ) to train the forces , support service programs , and support peacetime operations .
as a result , the amount of munitions funds needed will remain uncertain , and assessments of the size and composition of the industrial production base will be negatively affected .
despite the department's efforts to standardize the process and generate consistent requirements , many questions have continued to be raised about the accuracy or reliability of the munitions requirements determination process .
we recommend that the secretary of defense establish a direct link between the munitions needs of the combatant commands — recognizing the impact of weapons systems and munitions preferred or expected to be employed — and the munitions requirements determinations and purchasing decisions made by the military services .
