the crude oil windfall profit tax act ( p.l .
96-223 ) was enacted in 1980 as part of acompromise between the carter administration and the congress over the decontrol of crude oilprices .
despite its name , the crude oil windfall profit tax was not a tax on profits .
however , the tax's role in increasingdependence on imported oil , distorting resource use in the energy markets and the economy , as wellas the administrative and compliance burden of the tax , all played a role in its repeal .
the structure of the wpt was based on the structure of the oil price control program .
several bills would appropriate the proceedsfor the low - income home energy assistance program , which gives grants to poorerhouseholds to offset high energy bills and for residential weatherization .
the major economic issues concerning the wpt and its effects were: revenues , increaseddependence upon foreign oil , economic efficiency , and the tax's administrative and complianceburden .
it was an excisetax - - or more accurately , a system of excise taxes - - on domestically produced oil effective march1 , 1980 .
some bills would allocate thereceipts to offset the cost of supplemental spending bills targeted to aid victims ofhurricanes katrina and rita .
there are currently 14 bills in the 109th congress to impose some type ofwpt .
the congress was concernedthat the oil industry was not paying its fair share of federal taxes .
the algebraic formula for the wpt liability is as follows: t t = ï [p t m - p t b ( 1+ ï t - 2 ) ] ( 1- s ) ( 1- c ) where t t = the wpt in $ / barrel , in time t ( e.g. , in the 1st quarter of any year ) , ï = the wpt tax rate in percent ( see table 2 in the text ) , p t m = the market ( removal ) price of domestic crude oil at the wellhead at time t , p t b = the base price corresponding to the type of oil produced , as specified by law ( see table 2 ) ï = rate of inflation , as measured by the gnp deflator , so that ï t - 2 is the gnp deflatorlagged two quarters , ( 61 ) s = the rate of state severance tax , if any c = the rate of federal corporate income ta .
the tax was imposed on the difference between the market price of oil , which wastechnically referred to as the removal price , and a statutory 1979 base price that was adjustedquarterly for inflation and state severance taxes .
as discussed above , the need for revenue was one of the reasons for enacting the windfallprofit tax and was a principal issue in the debate over its repeal .
domestic crude oil is oil producedfrom an oil well located in the united states , or in any of its possessions , and it includes thecontinental shelf area of the united states .
 ( 8 ) all domestically produced oil that was not specifically tax - exempt was classified into oneof three categories or "tiers" based upon the age of the well , the type of oil , and the amount of dailyproduction .
