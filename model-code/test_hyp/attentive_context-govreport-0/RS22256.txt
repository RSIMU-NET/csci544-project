the origins of affirmative action law may be traced to the early 1960s as first the warren , and then the burger , court grappled with the seemingly intractable problem of racial segregation in the nation's public schools .
judicial rulings from this period recognized an affirmative duty , cast upon local school boards by the equal protection clause , to desegregate formerly dual - school systems and to eliminate the last vestiges of state - enforced segregation .
these holdings ushered in a two - decade era of massive desegregation — first in the south , and later the urban north — marked by federal desegregation orders frequently requiring drastic reconfiguration of school attendance patterns along racial lines and extensive student transportation schemes .
following the court's lead , congress and the executive approved a panoply of laws and regulations authorizing , either directly or by judicial or administrative interpretation , race - conscious strategies to promote minority opportunity in jobs , education , and governmental contracting .
official approval of affirmative action remedies was further codified by federal regulations construing the 1964 act's title vi , which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs and activities , including public or private educational institutions .
except as may be imposed by court order or consent decree to remedy past discrimination , however , there is no general statutory obligation on employers to adopt affirmative action remedies .
school districts across the nation operating under these decrees later sought to be declared in compliance with constitutional requirements in order to gain release from federal intervention .
the basic statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education derives from the civil rights act of 1964 .
the office of civil rights of the department of education interpreted title vi to require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination and to encourage affirmative action "[e]ven in the absence of such prior discrimination ... to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race , color , or national origin. .
since the early 1960s , minority participation goals have also been integral to executive branch enforcement of minority hiring and employment standards on federally financed construction projects and in connection with other large federal contracts .
these must include minority and female hiring goals and timetables to which the contractor must commit its good - faith efforts .
the supreme court eventually responded by holding that judicial control of a school system previously found guilty of intentional segregation should be relinquished if , looking to all aspects of school operations , it appears that the district has complied with desegregation requirements in "good faith" for a "reasonable period of time" and has eliminated "vestiges" of past discrimination "to the extent practicable. .
public and private employers with 15 or more employees are subject to a comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under title vii of the 1964 act .
executive order 11246 , as presently administered by the office of federal contract compliance programs , requires that all employers with 50 or more employees and federal contracts in excess of $50,000 file written affirmative action plans with the government .
