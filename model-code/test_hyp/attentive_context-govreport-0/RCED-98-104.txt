this investigation was undertaken by epa , the u.s. department of agriculture's food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) , and the department of health and human services' food and drug administration ( fda ) — each of which has jurisdiction over some aspect of the food safety system .
in may 1997 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) discovered elevated levels of dioxin in poultry samples analyzed as a part of its reassessment of the health risks of dioxin .
concerned about the performance of the federal agencies in handling this incident , you asked us to determine the ( 1 ) basis for the federal agencies' decisions to require producers to demonstrate that their food products did not contain levels of dioxin above one part per trillion ; ( 2 ) federal agencies' effectiveness in working together to make decisions to address the problem of dioxin - contaminated feed and in communicating their decisions to the affected state agencies , producers , and processors ; and ( 3 ) impact of the food safety system on the handling of this dioxin incident .
this discovery triggered a joint investigation to determine the source of the contamination .
by mid - june , the agencies had traced the contamination to feed distributed to poultry , fish , hog , and cattle producers in several southern and southwestern states .
however , between july and september , large and small producers and state health officials questioned whether the levels at which dioxin was found in the food products warranted the actions taken .
at this point , fda used its regulatory authority to halt the distribution of the contaminated feed and requested that the feed be disposed of by those holding it .
producers and state officials also reported that the agencies sometimes issued multiple and unclear directives , resulting in confusion over the actions producers were to take .
by mid - september 1997 , fda and fsis had determined that all the food products derived from the animals that had consumed the contaminated feed had only background levels of dioxin and approved them for commercial distribution .
because these elevated levels equated to the concentration levels in the animals , it was expected that the animals' growth would reduce the concentration levels over time .
subsequently , fda and fsis required that the affected food products be tested to demonstrate that they did not contain elevated dioxin levels — defined by the agencies as levels above one part per trillion of 2,3,7,8 tcdd , one of the more potent forms of dioxin — before these products could be distributed .
however , researchers from the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) told us that science has not yet determined the level of exposure to dioxin that may present a danger to human health .
as we have reported on numerous occasions , this fragmented food safety system necessitates extensive coordination efforts to minimize wasteful duplication of effort , prevent gaps in regulatory coverage , and avoid conflicting actions .
three days later , fda suspended its testing requirements for fish because of industry's and state officials' concerns with the implementation of its sampling and testing protocol .
these delays increased producers' costs .
