epa has taken steps to address several uncertainties surrounding the program's future viability .
given the program's limited funding , epa could use performance indicators to help evaluate , prioritize , and serve as the basis for making funding decisions .
the group's findings , including how epa should measure program performance , are as yet uncertain .
while the superfund program has implemented indicators to gauge the impacts of its efforts on human health and the environment , epa has acknowledged the limitations of its current means of measuring program performance and agrees that this shortcoming prevents the agency from communicating the outcomes of its work at hazardous waste sites to the public , congress , states , and the regulated community .
because superfund lacks indicators to fully measure the outcomes of the program's cleanup efforts , epa has asked the advisory council to develop criteria by which to measure the program's progress .
if successfully implemented for the superfund program , establishing these measures would also help epa and the congress make the difficult funding , policy , and program decisions that the current budget environment demands .
however , it is unclear whether the advisory council will reach consensus on its recommendations ; and its findings are not expected until december 2003 , at the earliest .
in considering changes to the program to address future challenges associated with the superfund program's fiscal uncertainty , we recommend that the administrator , epa , develop indicators that can be used to measure program performance .
epa underscored the limitations of its current means of measuring program performance when it asked the national advisory council for environmental policy and technology subcommittee to address measures of the superfund program's progress .
to assess the npl listing process , we evaluated epa's minimum eligibility criteria , policies , guidance , and recent practices ; we also assessed the extent of epa's coordination with states .
as agreed with your office , we examined ( 1 ) the current status of the superfund program , ( 2 ) the factors guiding epa's selection of sites to be placed on the npl , and ( 3 ) the program's future outlook .
however , epa acknowledges that there are still few cross - program metrics to capture comprehensive program outcomes .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
in our review of cleanup actions , we focused on remedial actions , which are generally costly and can take a long time to complete .
officials in 6 of the 10 epa regions agreed that states in their region faced fiscal problems and anticipated that shortfalls could cause problems with states' future cleanup capabilities .
the objectives of this review were to examine ( 1 ) the current status of the superfund program , ( 2 ) the factors guiding the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) selection of sites to be placed on the national priorities list ( npl ) , and ( 3 ) the program's future outlook .
however , epa's superfund program expenditures steadily decreased by $255 million from fiscal years 1999 through 2002 .
