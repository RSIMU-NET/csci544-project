one of the two major manufacturers of influenza vaccine for the united states warned in late august 2004 that deliveries would be delayed because a small quantity of its vaccine failed sterility tests .
as the traditional influenza vaccination period started in fall 2004 , the nation faced the unexpected loss of nearly half its projected vaccine supply .
on october 5 , 2004 , the manufacturer announced that because of potential contamination , it would be unable to release any vaccine for the u.s. market .
before the october 5 announcement , hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and its advisory committee on immunization practices ( acip ) had recommended that those at high risk of severe complications from influenza and those in other priority groups — such as health care workers and those aged 50 – 64 years — receive an influenza vaccination .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) had expected that this manufacturer would produce about 47 million doses — close to half of the 100 million doses estimated for the 2004 – 05 influenza season .
after the announcement , with no other u.s. - licensed manufacturers able to replace the large amount of lost vaccine on such short notice , concerns arose about the effects of the loss , especially on those most vulnerable to complications from influenza .
it is too early , however , to assess the effectiveness of these efforts in coordinating actions of federal , state , and local health agencies and others who play a part in the annual influenza vaccination process .
media reports of long lines of seniors waiting hours for a chance at a vaccination , of others at high risk who could not find a vaccination , and of individuals turned away who never returned when supplies became available fueled worries that the nation was not adequately prepared to respond to the significant vaccine shortage or to an influenza pandemic ( a widespread or worldwide influenza epidemic ) .
hhs also agreed that adjustments to vaccination recommendations and vaccine supply ideally should occur earlier in the influenza season , but such adjustments cannot always be implemented in a shortage year .
in some instances , uncoordinated communication from federal to state and local jurisdictions , and to providers and the general public , contributed to confusion , frustration , and individuals' failure to seek or receive an influenza vaccination .
the agency also provided details on other actions , such as approval of additional influenza vaccines for the u.s. market , that were under way .
conversely , federal efforts to boost supply late in the season had little effect , because demand fell off sharply in december and january , and vaccine became available too late .
aided by a relatively moderate influenza season , efforts to mitigate the sudden and unexpected shortage of influenza vaccine for the 2004 – 05 season were largely successful , although the season was not without problems .
educating health care providers and the public about all available influenza vaccines and forms of prevention may increase the number of vaccinated individuals and also reduce the spread of influenza .
this lack of preseason planning created confusion and delays during the optimal fall influenza vaccination window , when state and local public health agencies and health care providers most needed vaccine to protect individuals at high risk of severe complications .
