the american recovery and reinvestment act ( recovery act ; p.l .
111-5 , enacted february 17 , 2009 ) provided $3.4 billion for carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) projects and activities at the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) .
the large and rapid influx of funding for industrial - scale ccs projects was intended to accelerate development and demonstration of ccs in the united states .
congress has long been interested in the future of ccs as a mitigation strategy for lowering global emissions of carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) .
recovery act funding was intended , in part , to help doe achieve its research , development , and demonstration ( rd&d ) goals as outlined in the department's 2010 carbon dioxide capture and storage rd&d roadmap .
doe states that the mission for the doe office of fossil energy is "to ensure the availability of ultra - clean ( near - zero emissions ) , abundant , low - cost domestic energy from coal to fuel economic prosperity , strengthen energy security , and enhance environmental quality. .
understanding these factors also might help to clarify the potential for ccs as a greenhouse - gas ( ghg ) mitigation strategy as congress debates whether and how to reduce co 2 emissions from large , stationary sources .
of the $3.4 billion allocated for ccs activities , approximately $1.4 billion went unspent as of the 2015 spending deadline .
authority to spend recovery act funds expired on september 30 , 2015 .
recovery act funding represented the lion's share of ccs support at doe in the six - year period from fy2010 through fy2015 .
this report provides a preliminary assessment of recovery act - funded ccs projects and discusses possible factors that led to project delay , suspension , or cancellation within the context of doe's broader ccs effort .
the largest portion of the unspent funds , $795 million , was intended for doe's flagship ccs project , futuregen , which doe suspended in february 2015 .
building on available first generation technologies , next generation carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) technologies or carbon dioxide utilization technologies , expected to become commercially available in the mid - 2020s , will help put us on a path to a clean energy option for a world currently dependent on fossil fuels for 80% of its energy .
the obama administration has promulgated rules on co 2 emissions from current and future fossil fuel - burning power plants and entered into a global agreement to limit co 2 emissions .
by comparison , doe separately allotted a total of approximately $2.3 billion over the same time period to ccs - related activities from annual appropriations — not recovery act funding — under its coal program activities within the office of fossil energy .
however , several other large ccs demonstration projects were canceled , suspended , or failed to spend all of their recovery act funding before the deadline .
doe , however , has continued to embrace ccs as part of the administration's strategy to reduce co 2 emissions from power plants: roughly one - third of u.s. carbon emissions come from power plants and other large point sources .
