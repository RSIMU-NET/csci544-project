the tragic events of september 11 , 2001 , and hurricane katrina have highlighted the critical importance of having effective radio communications systems for law enforcement and public safety agencies including federal agencies with such responsibilities .
the integrated wireless network ( iwn ) was intended to be a collaborative effort among the departments of justice ( doj ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and the treasury to provide secure , seamless , interoperable , and reliable nationwide wireless communications in support of federal agents and officers engaged in law enforcement , protective services , homeland defense , and disaster response missions .
in order to effectively respond to events such as natural disasters , criminal activities , and domestic terrorism , law enforcement and public safety agencies need reliable systems that enable communication with their counterparts in other disciplines and jurisdictions .
this initiative , begun in 2001 , was originally estimated to cost approximately $5 billion .
specifically , congress should consider requiring the departments to establish an effective governance structure that includes a formal process for making decisions and resolving disputes , define and articulate a common outcome for this joint effort , and develop a joint strategy for improving radio communications .
further , since the 1990s , increasing demand for radio communications capabilities in both the private and public sectors has created a need to use radio communications capacity more efficiently .
specifically , congress should consider requiring the departments to: establish an effective governance structure that includes a formal process for making decisions and resolving disputes ; define and articulate a common outcome for this joint effort ; and develop a joint strategy for improving radio communications .
at your request , we determined the extent to which doj , dhs , and the treasury are developing a joint radio communications solution to improve communications among federal agencies .
to address this objective , we reviewed and analyzed documentation from doj , dhs , and the treasury to determine the status of iwn , interviewed officials from each department about the extent to which they are collaborating with the other departments on iwn or on an alternative joint radio communications solution , reviewed and analyzed documentation for independent radio communications projects at doj and dhs to identify actions the departments are taking to improve their radio communications systems , reviewed and analyzed past and present agreements among the departments to determine the extent to which a governance structure is in place that enables effective collaboration , and compared collaboration activities performed by the departments to selected practices previously identified by gao as helpful to sustaining collaboration among federal agencies .
congress should consider requiring the departments of justice , homeland security , and treasury to collaborate on the development and implementation of a joint radio communications solution .
objective , scope , and methodology doj , dhs , and treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution agency comments and our evaluation the tragic events of 9 / 11 and hurricane katrina have highlighted the critical importance of having effective radio communications systems for law enforcement and public safety agencies including federal agencies with such responsibilities .
we performed our audit work in the washington , d.c. , metropolitan area at doj , the federal bureau of investigation , the drug enforcement administration , dhs , immigration and customs enforcement , customs and border protection , the treasury , the national institute of standards and technology , the national telecommunications and information administration , and the office of management and budget .
