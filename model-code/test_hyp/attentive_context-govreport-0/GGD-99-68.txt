the 1990s have been a time of rapid and sweeping change at the small business administration ( sba ) .
in response to the clinton administration's initiative to reinvent the federal government , sba underwent a major reorganization and downsizing .
from august 1993 to march 1997 , sba's workforce was cut by about 15 percent .
in addition , new administrators were appointed at the agency in 1993 , 1994 , and 1997 , which brought about further changes in sba's executive offices , and following the change in control of congress in 1995 , sba provided noncompetitive , career appointments to some displaced congressional staff members under the ramspeck act then in effect .
questions arose that improper personnel practices - - such as political favoritism and the improper hiring of district office directors and improper salary setting for political appointees - - had taken place at the agency .
because of the changes that were occurring , the reorganization and downsizing in particular , the 1990s have been turbulent times for sba employees .
the regional office structure , a layer of management between sba headquarters and district offices , was a prime target of this reduction .
in response , the committee asked us to examine several events related to personnel reassignments , appointments , and activities at sba .
sba participates in interagency details of employees but did not have adequate procedures to ( 1 ) accurately identify when it should bill agencies for the reimbursable details of sba employees and ( 2 ) monitor the actual length of details .
sba has recognized that its hr staff need further guidance on pay setting and recruitment bonuses and has drafted a new set of procedures to provide that guidance .
these authorizations and vouchers were for fiscal year 1997 and part of fiscal year 1998 .
sba provided us the names of ( 1 ) sba field personnel and the offices to which they were assigned , both before and after sba's reorganization and downsizing ; ( 2 ) district directors who were appointed between january 1 , 1993 , and december 31 , 1998 ; ( 3 ) political and ramspeck act appointees who were appointed between october 1 , 1991 , and september 30 , 1998 ; and ( 4 ) employees detailed from sba to other federal agencies during the period october 1 , 1991 , through september 30 , 1998 .
sba officials agree that an improved system of internal controls is necessary and have taken steps in that direction .
significant personnel changes have occurred at sba since the early 1990s , some of which resulted from the considerable reorganization and downsizing that sba experienced .
regional offices were greatly affected by reorganization and downsizing .
consequently , sba had not developed a recruitment bonus plan , as required by regulations .
as indicated earlier , sba has since decided to initiate a recruitment bonus policy .
such procedures should ensure that the specifics of each detail are appropriately documented and monitored and that in the case of cost - reimbursable details , all costs are accounted for and promptly reimbursed .
it is unclear from sba's comments whether this new procedure is to apply to all details or to only those details that are extended or terminate early .
