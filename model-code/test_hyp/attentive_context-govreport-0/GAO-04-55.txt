we agreed to provide information on ( 1 ) the progress made in deploying wireless e911 services throughout the country , ( 2 ) the factors that are affecting this progress , and ( 3 ) current federal government actions to promote the deployment of wireless e911 services .
fcc has considerable regulatory authority over wireless carriers and has placed location accuracy standards and deployment deadlines on the wireless carriers .
the pace of wireless e911 deployment has been a key concern for the congress .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
the wireless communications and public safety act of 1999 designated 911 as the universal emergency telephone number within the united states and called on fcc to encourage and support efforts by the states to deploy wireless e911 services by working with state and local officials , the telecommunications industry , consumer groups , and those involved in public safety services.there is also a congressional e911 caucus that aims to educate lawmakers , constituents , and communities about the importance of 911 systems.you asked us to provide an overview of the deployment of wireless e911 services across the country .
with almost 150 million americans now subscribing to a mobile phone service and new concerns about homeland security facing our nation , the ability to reach 911 from sidewalks , highways , and rural areas has become increasingly important .
because many of these hurdles have now been overcome , fcc has stated that it will not hesitate to use its enforcement power when the wireless carriers fail to meet their current deployment timetables .
state public utility commissions have some authority over wireless carriers' terms and conditions of service .
according to the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , around one - third of 911 calls are now made from mobile phones .
fcc has technical and educational initiatives under way to help the parties involved to share information on deployment practices , problems , and experiences .
beyond enforcing deadlines on wireless carriers , fcc has taken actions to identify both roadblocks and best practices in wireless e911 implementation .
if this holds true , consumers and emergency management officials will be faced with a geographic patchwork of wireless e911 areas: some will have service ; some will not .
to provide information on the progress made in deploying wireless e911 services throughout the country , we conducted a telephone survey of the state e911 contacts .
funding for psap equipment upgrades remains a major issue for many states and localities and continues to hamper nationwide deployment .
according to fcc , the commission does not have clear jurisdiction over wireline carriers with regard to wireless e911 implementation , and the commission looks to the state public utility commissions , which have clear and sufficient authority to take the lead .
the state public utility commissions also have a great deal of authority over the lecs , including authority over intrastate service rates , while fcc retains some authority over lec interconnection agreements with wireless carriers and other issues .
however , no single entity has regulatory authority and oversight over the entire implementation process .
