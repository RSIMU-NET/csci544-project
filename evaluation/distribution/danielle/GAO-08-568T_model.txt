in my statement today , i will discuss ( 1 ) factors contributing to poor contracting outcomes and accountability , ( 2 ) long - standing issues in the department of defense's ( dod ) management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces , and ( 3 ) efforts to improve the capacity of the iraqi government .
about $45 billion was provided for reconstruction efforts , including rebuilding iraq's oil and electricity sectors , improving its security forces , and enhancing iraq's capacity to govern .
between fiscal years 2001 to 2008 , congress appropriated nearly $700 billion for the global war on terrorism .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the challenges the united states must address to successfully improve performance and ensure accountability over u.s. efforts to stabilize and reconstruct iraq .
prudence with taxpayer funds and growing long - range fiscal challenges demand that the united states maximize its return on the billions of dollars invested in iraq .
the majority of this amount has been provided to dod for military operations in support of operation iraqi freedom , including the cost of equipping , maintaining , and supporting our deployed forces .
further , strengthening iraq's fragile government institutions , which have thus far failed to adequately deter corruption , stimulate employment , or deliver essential services , is critical to establishing a peaceful , stable , and secure iraq .
the abilities of the inspectors general to provide in - country oversight of specific projects and reconstruction challenges have enabled gao to focus on national , sector , and interagency issues .
in prior reports , gao recommended that , to improve accountability and minimize opportunities for fraud , waste , and abuse of u.s. funds , ( 1 ) dod adopt sound business processes in its acquisition strategies , such as definitizing contracts in a timely fashion and strengthening accountability procedures ; ( 2 ) dod leadership ensure implementation of and compliance with existing guidance to improve its management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces ; and ( 3 ) u.s. agencies work with iraq to develop strategic plans for key sectors .
since 2003 , we have issued nearly 130 iraq - related reports and testimonies .
gao's broad audit authority allows it to support congress through strategic analyses of issues that cut across multiple federal agencies and sources of funding , while the inspectors general focus primarily on preventing and exposing fraud , waste , and abuse in individual federal agency programs .
most waste does not involve a violation of law , but it does involve mismanagement resulting from poor leadership or guidance ; inappropriate actions or omissions , including the use of poor business arrangements ; or inadequate oversight , often caused by having too - few skilled people .
our work in iraq largely has been performed under my authority as comptroller general to conduct evaluations on my own initiative since it is a matter of broad interest to the entire congress .
however , the inability to do so should not detract from the need to improve management and accountability over our efforts in iraq .
as we see it , waste occurs when taxpayers do not receive reasonable value for their money in connection with any government - funded activity due to inappropriate acts or omissions by officials with control over or access to government resources .
