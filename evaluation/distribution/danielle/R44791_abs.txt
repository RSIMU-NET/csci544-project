funding authorization for the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , included in the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 ( p.l . 114-190 ) , expired at the end of fy2017 . a subsequent six - month extension ( p.l . 115-63 ) is set to expire at the end of march 2018. long - term faa reauthorization measures ( h.r . 2997 and s. 1405 ) are currently under consideration . in addition to setting spending levels , faa authorization acts typically set policy on a wide range of issues related to civil aviation . this report considers prominent topics in the 115th congress reauthorization debate . most faa programs are financed through the airport and airway trust fund ( aatf ) , which is funded by a variety of taxes and fees on air transportation . the financial health of the aatf is generally good . however , airlines ' unbundling of ancillary fees from airfares is adversely affecting aatf revenue , as only base airfares are subject to the ticket tax that is the largest source of revenue for the trust fund . reductions in aatf revenue would leave faa more reliant on appropriations from the general fund . other major issues likely to arise during the reauthorization debate include the following : air traffic control privatization . many commissions over the years have recommended moving responsibility for air traffic control from faa , a government agency , to either an independent government - owned corporation or a private entity controlled by aviation stakeholders . delays in implementing the satellite - based nextgen air traffic control system have renewed interest in this possibility , although congress chose not to enact such proposals in 2016. unmanned aerial vehicles . large numbers of drones have come into use , and the numerous reports of near - collisions between drones and manned aircraft raise safety concerns . additionally , congress has not addressed privacy concerns related to government - operated , commercial , and recreational drones . essential airline service ( eas ) . congress has repeatedly attempted to limit the number of localities eligible to participate in this program to subsidize flights to communities that would otherwise lose all commercial airline service , as well as to limit the amount of subsidies per passenger . few communities have been dropped from the program , and costs continue to rise . foreign airlines . some u.s. airlines and airline labor unions seek reconsideration of the recent u.s. approval of a foreign carrier permit for norwegian air international , an ireland - based discount air carrier , to fly across the atlantic . some u.s. carriers also have called for renegotiation of u.s. air service agreements with persian gulf states amid claims that three fast - growing airlines based in that region are posing unfair competition to u.s. air carriers . certification reform . faa relies heavily on aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers to provide technical expertise in the certification process . faa oversight has been found to be inconsistent , raising questions regarding safety and efficiency . equipment manufacturers have raised concerns that faa 's certification process makes it difficult to bring new products to market in a timely fashion and threatens their international competitiveness . this report does not attempt to be comprehensive . many issues debated prior to passage of the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 are not discussed unless further congressional consideration appears probable . additional issues , not discussed in this report , may arise as congress moves forward with reauthorization .
