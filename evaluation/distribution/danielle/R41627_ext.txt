considerable congressional attention has been placed on the treatment of consumers within the private health insurance marketplace . among the many concerns , particular attention has been paid to the value of coverage in terms of out - of - pocket ( oop ) costs relative to premiums . one method that lowers the value of coverage is the use of annual limits on the dollar amount of coverage . private health insurers use annual limits to require the consumer to assume 100% of the cost of coverage after a certain amount of spending for the year has been reached . the spending can be for the total health benefits covered or targeted to specific services , such as hospitalizations . the patient protection and affordable care act ( p.l . 111-148 , ppaca ) was enacted on march 23 , 2010 , and amended by the health care and education reconciliation act ( p.l . there is substantial variability in the marketplace due to different consumer demands , but generally , a limited benefit plan offers coverage with restrictive annual limits on total benefits and / or on specific service categories ( e.g. , surgeries ) . they say that without the option of limited benefit plans , these workers would likely become uninsured . on the other hand , some consumer groups have argued that limited benefit plans are not deserving of any regulatory leniency . organizations may apply for a waiver on an annual basis until january 1 , 2014 , when annual limits are prohibited . the memorandum , and subsequent guidance , establishes the following reporting requirements: the terms of the plan or policy for which a waiver is sought ; the number of individuals enrolled in the plan or covered by the policy ; the annual limit ( s ) and rates applicable to the plan or policy ; and a brief description of why compliance with the restriction on annual limits standard would result in a significant decrease in access to benefits or a significant increase in premiums paid . for context , it is relevant to note that congress has not consistently specified the manner in which information concerning health care waivers is to be released to the public . indeed , the annual limits provision of ppaca does not even have a specific public reporting requirement . as a result of different legal standards , or in some cases the absence of a congressional directive , no standardized practice for releasing information about health care waivers has ever been developed . no obvious bias could be found in the publicly available application materials for the annual limits waivers .
