the federal reserve ( fed ) is mandated to keep inflation low and stable , and alters interest rates in order to do so .
first , rising inflation is unpopular with the public , in part because some households are more adversely affected by inflation than others .
in recent years , the fed has focused attention on the core rate of inflation , a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy prices , in explanations of its policy decisions .
second , high or rising inflation can reduce productivity by distorting price signals , so that it is hard for businesses to tell if prices are changing in relative terms , and by individuals wasting resources in order to maintain the purchasing power of their wealth .
inflation , the general rise in the prices of goods and services , is important to policymakers for several reasons .
changes in inflation often indicate changes in the business cycle â€” rising inflation is often a sign that the economy is overheating and falling inflation is a sign that the economy is sluggish .
finally , inflation plays a key role in macroeonomic stabilization policy .
in fed chairman ben bernanke's july 2007 testimony to congress , he stated that "food and energy prices tend to be quite volatile , so that , looking forward , core inflation...may be a better gauge than overall inflation of underlying inflation trends. .
for example , in july 2007 , the third sentence of the 10-sentence federal open market committee statement summarizing the committee's policy decision read , "readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. .
the most commonly cited measure of inflation is the percent change in the consumer price index ( cpi ) .
inflation is measured as the percent change in a price index .
the fed's task is to counteract this by raising interest rates in order to reduce the growth rate of interest - sensitive spending .
theoretically , short - term changes in inflation can be caused by the supply - side or demand - side of the economy .
when core inflation approached 3% in 2006 , chairman bernanke said that it had "reached a level that , if sustained , would be at or above the upper end of the range that many economists , including myself , would consider consistent with price stability...." this report defines core inflation , reviews recent trends , and analyzes the advantages and drawbacks of using core inflation .
comparisons over time of wages , wealth , rates of return , government transfers such as social security payments , and so on should all use a headline measure of inflation , because all of these concepts depend on a broad measure of inflation .
considering that the fed judges 2% inflation to be on the low side and 3% inflation on the high side , the definition used in these years would have arguably strongly colored their policy stance .
policymakers are concerned with future inflation because of lags between a change in policy and its effect on the economy .
there is no inherent reason that changes in food and energy prices cannot be caused by changes in aggregate demand .
