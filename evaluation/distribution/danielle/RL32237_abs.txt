people obtain insurance to protect themselves against the possibility of financial loss in the future . health insurance provides protection against the possibility of financial loss due to high health care expenses . also , people do not know ahead of time exactly what their health care expenses will be , so paying for health insurance on a regular basis helps ease their out - of - pocket spending . while health coverage continues to be mostly a private enterprise in this country , government plays an increasingly significant role . government has initiated and responded to dynamics in medicine , the economy , and the workplace through legislation and public policies . one of the most recent efforts was enactment and ongoing implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) . aca includes provisions to encourage the expansion of health insurance coverage , and establish new federal health insurance standards , among other reforms . americans obtain health insurance in different settings and through a variety of methods . in 2013 , a majority ( 64.2 % ) of americans obtained health insurance through the private sector , which includes both employer - sponsored and individual market coverage . public programs ( medicare , medicaid / chip , or health services for military servicemembers and veterans ) provided coverage to 34.3 % of americans . approximately 13.4 % of americans were uninsured for the entire year of 2013. health insurance benefits are delivered and financed under different systems . the factors that distinguish one delivery system from another are many , including how health care is financed , how much access to providers and services is controlled , and how much authority the enrollee has to design her / his health plan . to illustrate , managed care is characterized by predetermined restrictions on accessing services and providers , whereas individual decision - making regarding use of health benefits is a hallmark of consumer driven health care , such as health savings accounts . as economic conditions change , a specific delivery system may gain or lose the interest of affected parties .
