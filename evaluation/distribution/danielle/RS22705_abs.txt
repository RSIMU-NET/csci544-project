inflation measures the rate of change in all prices . maintaining low and stable inflation is one of the primary goals of macroeconomic policy . but how should inflation be measured ? . policymakers , particularly at the federal reserve , often refer to core inflation in their policy decisions . core inflation is commonly defined as a measure of inflation that omits changes in food and energy prices . some policymakers prefer to use core inflation to predict future overall inflation because food and energy price volatility makes it difficult to discern trends from the overall inflation rate . a drawback of an over - reliance on core inflation , however , is that an extended period of rapidly rising food or energy prices could cause all other prices to accelerate . a focus on core may cause policymakers to fail to react to such a rise in inflation until it is too late . this scenario may have occurred recently . many economists are concerned that rapid increases in food and energy prices are now pushing overall inflation to uncomfortably high levels . furthermore , several studies have failed to find core inflation to be a good forecaster of future inflation , casting doubt on the very rationale for relying on it .
