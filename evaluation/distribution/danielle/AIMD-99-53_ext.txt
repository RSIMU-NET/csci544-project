this report responds to your request that we evaluate the department of interior's high - level implementation plan ( high level plan ) for improving its management of the indian trust funds and resources under its control . the projects are directed at improving systems , enhancing the accuracy and completeness of interior's data regarding the ownership and lease of indian lands , and correcting deficiencies with respect to records management , training , policy and procedures , and internal controls within 3 years . the objectives of our review were to assess whether interior has reasonable assurance that ( 1 ) the high level plan provides an effective solution for addressing long - standing problems with interior's indian trust responsibilities and ( 2 ) its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs . to determine whether interior has reasonable assurance that the high level plan provides an effective solution for addressing interior's long - standing problems with its indian trust responsibilities , we reviewed the clinger - cohen act of 1996 and current technical literature as a basis for assessing the information technology aspects of the high - level plan ; reviewed the process that was used to develop the plan ; reviewed the strategic plan that was produced by interior's special trustee for american indians ; met with senior interior officials responsible for developing the plan , including interior's chief information officer , chief financial officer , deputy special trustee , and the interior contractor who assisted in the development of the plan ; and analyzed the high level plan for internal consistency and compliance with generally accepted best practices . specifically , interior did not adequately define important service requirements or sufficiently analyze technical alternatives . further , interior did not develop an overall risk management plan , require the contractor to demonstrate its system could work with interior's data and systems , or establish realistic project time frames . first , interior did not develop a risk management plan . because it did not establish clear requirements and did not take critical steps to manage risk effectively , interior has no assurance that the new asset and land records management service will meet its specific performance , security , and data management needs or that the service can be delivered on schedule and within budget . to ensure that interior's information systems are compatible and effectively satisfy interior's business needs , we recommend that , before making major investments in information technology systems to support trust operations , the secretary direct the chief information officer to develop an information systems architecture for indian trust operations that ( 1 ) provides a high - level description of interior's mission and target concept of operations , ( 2 ) defines the business functions to be performed and the relationships among functions ; the information needed to perform the functions ; the users and locations of the functions and information ; and the information systems needed to support the department's business needs , ( 3 ) identifies the improvement projects to be undertaken , specifying what they will do , how they are interrelated , what data they will exchange , and what their relative priorities are , and ( 4 ) details specific standards and approaches that will be used to build or acquire systems , including hardware , software , communications , data management , security , and performance characteristics . interior does not directly address the finding that it did not thoroughly analyze technical alternatives before choosing a vendor and a cots product to provide asset and land records management services . interior then describes several actions which it feels minimizes acquisition risk .
