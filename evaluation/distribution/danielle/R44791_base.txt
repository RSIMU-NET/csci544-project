114-190 are summarized below . since 1992 , the united states has reached 114 "open skies" agreements governing international air passenger and air freight services . these agreements typically allow any airline based in either signatory jurisdiction to offer service between the two jurisdictions , and let the airlines determine their flight routes , frequencies , fares , and aircraft types according to market demand . there are two current controversies related to open skies agreements . one controversy involves some u.s. network airlines' and labor unions' opposition to the expansion of three fast - growing airlines based in the persian gulf region â€” emirates airline , etihad airways , and qatar airways . the u.s. carriers allege the subsidies and support that these three persian gulf carriers purportedly receive from their government owners contravene fair competitive practices requirements of their home countries' open skies agreements with the united states . the u.s. carriers have urged the administration to freeze the number of flights gulf carriers operate to the united states and to renegotiate the open skies accords with qatar and the united arab emirates . similar protests have occurred in europe , initiated by lufthansa group and air france - klm , and by labor groups . the other controversy concerns norwegian air international ( nai ) , an airline that is registered in ireland . on december 2 , 2016 , dot granted approval of nai's application for a foreign air carrier permit to operate transatlantic flights to u.s. destinations . this action is expected to lead to a substantial increase in discount airline service across the north atlantic over the next few years . nai , based in ireland , is a subsidiary of norwegian air shuttle ( nas ) , the third - largest discount carrier in europe . norwegian air shuttle and its intercontinental arm , norwegian long haul , hold faa - issued airline certificates under norwegian license and provide nonstop services to several u.s. destinations from several european countries , including norway . these flights are authorized under the u.s. - eu air service agreement , which has applied to norway since 2011 ( even though norway is not an eu member state ) . several u.s. and european network airlines and labor organizations strongly opposed nai's application , insisting that nai's business model is predicated on sidestepping norway's stricter labor laws in favor of ireland's less - strict rules . more specifically , the opponents argued that nai's plans to operate with an irish air operator's certificate rather than a norwegian one and to source crews from asia ( possibly through a third - party company ) as well as from the united states and europe would violate article 17 bis of the u.s. - eu air service agreement . this article stipulates that "opportunities created by the agreement are not intended to undermine labour standards or the labour - related rights and principles contained in the parties' respective laws. although dot decided that it had no legal basis to deny nai's application , the agency did not opine on the merits of opposing arguments or concerns .
