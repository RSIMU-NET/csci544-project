2601 et seq . thirty - five years of experience with tsca implementation and enforcement have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to tsca's core provisions in title i . based on hearing testimony , stakeholders generally agree that tsca needs to be updated , although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions . therefore , this report compares key provisions of s. 847 , as introduced , with provisions of tsca title i ( 15 u.s.c . for example , provisions related to testing would still be in section 4 , requirements for notifying epa when a new chemical or new use is proposed would still be in section 5 , and regulatory authorities would remain in section 6 . s. 847 , as introduced , directs the epa administrator to establish varied or tiered minimum data set requirements for different chemical substances or categories of substances . manufacturers would be given a specified period of time to produce and submit data meeting the minimum data requirements for chemicals that are already in commerce and for any new chemicals that they propose to manufacture . data sets would have to be submitted within five years of the date of enactment of s. 847 . current law does not routinely require submission of data for chemicals , but epa has the authority to require data submission if it promulgates a rule based on a finding that a chemical "may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment" and the agency demonstrates a data need . s. 847 directs the epa administrator to prioritize all chemicals already in commerce for evaluation and risk management by establishing a list that "contains the names of the chemical substances that … warrant placement within 1 of 3 priority classes … and identifies the priority class to which each listed chemical substance or category of chemical substance has been assigned by the administrator. . priority class 2 chemicals would be defined as those "that the administrator determines require safety standard determinations … based on any more - than - theoretical concern , that there is uncertainty as to whether a chemical substance would satisfy the safety standard. . if epa demonstrates that a risk associated with a chemical is unreasonable ( relative to the benefits provided by the chemical and the estimated risks and benefits of any alternatives ) , the agency is required to regulate , but only to the extent necessary to reduce that risk to a reasonable level and using "the least burdensome" restriction . s. 847 would expedite regulatory action , relative to the process under current law , by authorizing epa in some cases to issue administrative orders instead of rules ( which must be promulgated under current law ) , exempting certain epa decisions from judicial review , and removing certain tsca requirements that are in addition to requirements specified in the administrative procedure act ( 5 u.s.c . s. 847 would authorize epa activities not currently authorized under tsca to allow implementation of three international agreements pertaining to persistent organic pollutants and other hazardous chemicals . several new provisions are included in s. 847 . epa would be directed to develop an action plan to reduce exposure in such "hot spots. . children's environmental health also is addressed by the bill . "green chemistry and engineering" also would be promoted through grants .
