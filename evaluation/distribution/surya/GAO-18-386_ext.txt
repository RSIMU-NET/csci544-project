the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) , as amended , and its implementing regulations , require hipaa - covered entities ( e.g. , providers and insurers ) to provide individuals , upon request , with access to their medical records , which contain protected health information ( e.g. , information on diagnoses , billing , medications , and test results ) . the 21st century cures act included a provision for us to study patient access to medical records and issue a report by june 13 , 2018 . to describe what is known about the fees charged for accessing patients' medical records , we reviewed selected hipaa requirements and implementing regulations and guidance . among other things , this guidance states that as part of a patient's right of access , patients have the right to obtain copies of their medical records and the right to have their records forwarded to a person or entity of their choice ; in these circumstances , patients are only to be charged a “reasonable , cost - based fee.” the guidance further notes that state laws that provide individuals with greater rights of access to their medical records are not preempted by hipaa and still apply . in general , both providers' staff and roi vendors follow the same process when fulfilling requests for medical records for both individual patients and third parties . federal laws establish limits on the fees that may be charged for two of the three types of requests for medical records: ( 1 ) patient requests , when patients request access to their medical records , and ( 2 ) patient - directed requests , when patients request that their records be sent to another person or entity , such as another provider . for third - party requests , providers and vendors working on their behalf may charge whatever is allowed under these state requirements . across the four selected states , we found examples of the kinds of variation stakeholders have described in the allowable fees for patient and third - party requests for medical records . the amounts charged are based on the number of pages requested and vary across the three states . one state — ohio — has established a different per - page fee amount for third - party requests . one state — rhode island — specifies a maximum allowable fee if the provider uses an electronic health records ( ehr ) system for patient and patient - directed requests . this guidance describes the requirements of hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act , as well as their implementing regulations . this advocate explained that per - page fees , even if legally authorized , can pose challenges for patients ; in particular , patients who have been seriously ill can accumulate medical records that number in the thousands of pages and can , as a result , face fees in excess of $1,000 for a single copy of their records . in addition , stakeholders we interviewed commonly stated that the increased use of electronically stored health information in ehrs has resulted in a more complex and challenging environment when responding to requests for patients' medical records . examples of patient access complaints provided to us by ocr included complaints about the following: providers not responding even after the patient made multiple requests , or providers taking longer than 30 days to respond to a request for medical records or other information ; providers charging excessive fees for copies of patients' medical providers not responding to requests from personal representatives or providers denying medical records requests from a parent or parents of children .
