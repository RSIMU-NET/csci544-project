in 2007 , the supreme court issued its decision in massachusetts v. epa , its first pronouncement on climate change and a singularly important environmental law decision . this report reviews that decision , but leaves coverage of the many epa actions based on the decision to other crs reports . massachusetts v. epa was a case brought to challenge epa 's denial of a petition asking the agency to regulate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new motor vehicles under the clean air act ( caa ) . by a vote of 5-4 , the court held first that massachusetts had standing to sue , an issue that took up most of the majority opinion . on the merits , the court found that the caa definition of `` air pollutant '' was unambiguously broad enough to include ghgs . that being so , the court held , caa section 202 authorizes epa to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles on the basis of their possible climate change impacts . finally , the court determined that the phrase `` in [ the administrator 's ] judgment '' in section 202 did not authorize epa to inject policy considerations into its decision whether to so regulate . for these reasons , the court reversed the lower court decision upholding the petition denial . the court 's decision left epa with three options for responding to the petition : ( 1 ) find that new motor vehicle ghg emissions may `` endanger public health or welfare , '' the prerequisite to limiting them under section 202 , then issue emission standards ; ( 2 ) find that they do not satisfy that prerequisite , or ( 3 ) decide that climate change science is so uncertain as to preclude making either finding ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . given the state of climate change science by 2007 , it was widely believed at the time that option ( 1 ) was the only legally defensible one for epa . this is the option that epa took , starting with an `` endangerment finding '' issued in 2009. since 2007 , the finding of standing in massachusetts generally has not proved helpful to non - state plaintiffs in climate change litigation , leaving intact this considerable threshold hurdle for climate change plaintiffs . in addition , the massachusetts holding was used , in part , by a 2011 supreme court decision to bar federal common law claims against entities based on their contribution to climate change . on the other hand , massachusetts has been applied by epa to support regulations not only of motor vehicles but also of stationary sources of ghg emissions . in particular , massachusetts helped bring about a 2010 litigation settlement that committed epa to restricting ghg emissions from certain stationary sources of emissions under section 111 of the caa . epa issued two rules based in part on this settlement : new source performance standards ( nspss ) for ghg emissions from new , modified , or reconstructed fossil fuel fired power plants , and emission guidelines ( known as the `` clean power plan '' ) for ghg emissions from existing fossil fuel fired power plants . both rules are being challenged in litigation , and the clean power plan was stayed by the supreme court in february 2016 , as discussed in other crs reports . the massachusetts decision remains judicially unquestioned . its holding that the caa authorizes epa to regulate ghg emissions remains the governing law , barring supreme court reversal or congressional amendment of the caa .
