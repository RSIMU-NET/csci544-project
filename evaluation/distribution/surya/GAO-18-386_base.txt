( see fig . available information suggests that the allowable fees for accessing medical records vary by type of request — that is , whether a patient or third party is making the request — and by state . federal laws establish limits on the fees that may be charged for two of the three types of requests for medical records: ( 1 ) patient requests , when patients request access to their medical records , and ( 2 ) patient - directed requests , when patients request that their records be sent to another person or entity , such as another provider . hipaa does not establish limits on fees for third - party requests . the information we obtained from stakeholders is not generalizable . to describe efforts by ocr to ensure patients' access to their medical records , we reviewed data from ocr on all patient access complaints received between february 2016 and june 2017 . we assessed the reliability of these data by ( 1 ) performing electronic testing of required data elements , ( 2 ) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them , and ( 3 ) consulting agency officials who are knowledgeable about the data . we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives . in addition , the report is available at no charge on the gao website at http: / / www.gao.gov . we also reviewed relevant ocr documentation , including policies and procedures , audit guidelines , and reports on hipaa violations , as well as 10 examples of patient access complaints provided to us by ocr . contact points for our office of congressional relations and office of public affairs can be found on the last page of this report . other major contributors to this report are listed in appendix i . in addition to the contact named above , tom conahan , assistant director ; andrea e. richardson , analyst - in - charge ; krister friday ; and monica perez - nelson made key contributions to this report . for example , providers sometimes incorrectly deny family members' access to a patient's health information , which hipaa allows under certain circumstances . provider representatives , patient advocates , and an expert agreed that providers could benefit from more training on medical record access issues , including training on the options patients have for accessing their medical records . finally , we interviewed officials from ocr and onc . for example , patient advocates said that the “notice of privacy practices” form that patients receive and are asked to sign when they first seek care from a provider could be improved to raise awareness of the rights associated with accessing medical records . this form is used to explain a provider's privacy policies and obligations , and what patients have to do to obtain access to their medical records . however , a provider association and an expert told us that these forms are not always easy for patients to understand , and patients might not always read them . ocr has developed a standard privacy notice that providers may adopt if they choose .
