because of this uncertainty , you asked us to provide you with information on ( 1 ) approaches that show promise in helping teenage mothers complete their secondary education as a step toward self - sufficiency and ( 2 ) aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program activities that enable teenage mothers on welfare to complete their secondary education .
as the congress and the administration consider how to reform the nation's welfare system and reduce the number of families that are dependent on welfare , concerns have focused on the increasing numbers of births to unmarried teenagers .
this issue is of particular concern because families started by teenage mothers represent almost half the families receiving welfare and are likely to receive assistance for long periods of time , at great cost to the public .
while low - income teenage mothers stand a better chance of avoiding long - term welfare dependency if they obtain a high school education , there is uncertainty about how to achieve this outcome .
to develop this information , we visited 13 local programs in new jersey , new mexico , oregon , texas , vermont , and wisconsin that were recognized by experts as being exemplary in helping disadvantaged teenage mothers complete their secondary education .
since most of these programs had not been formally evaluated , we also examined published impact evaluations of programs serving teenage mothers to determine which approaches had demonstrated success .
we synthesized the results of the five impact evaluations whose methods we judged to be rigorous enough to produce credible results .
we did not , however , verify the information given to us by the afdc and jobs program administrators .
 ( app .
i provides additional information about these evaluations and our synthesis of their results. ) .
finally , we conducted interviews with afdc and jobs program administrators in the 15 cities across the country that had the highest numbers of births to unwed mothers under the age of 20 in 1992 .
the congress is currently deliberating several reforms to the welfare system , including whether to provide benefits to teenage mothers .
all five programs also provided child care and transportation assistance ; otherwise , these programs were quite different .
these three afdc offices coordinate with educational providers to ensure that welfare benefits are contingent on teenagers' continuing their education .
we did our work between june 1994 and july 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
although our work shows that a number of approaches can work to help teenage mothers complete high school , whether states will use these approaches will likely be influenced by the final form of the legislation .
numerous programs have been established in communities throughout the country to reduce the negative consequences of teenage parenting .
our synthesis of rigorous impact evaluations of five such programs operating in multiple sites identified one feature that distinguished the programs that increased high school or ged completions from those that did not: active monitoring and follow - up of school attendance .
many programs also recognized lack of transportation as a barrier to teenagers' ability to complete high school .
the administration for children and families ( acf ) , within the u.s. department of health and human services , commented on a draft of this report and generally agreed with our conclusions about promising program approaches , but expressed several concerns .
