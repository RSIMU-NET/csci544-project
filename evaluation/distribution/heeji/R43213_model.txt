the u.s. constitution imposes on the government a system of restraints to provide that no unfair law is enforced and that no law is enforced unfairly .
recent high - profile military justice issues include dismissal of charges by setting aside findings in an aviano court - martial related to sexual offenses ; alleged sexual assault of a civilian by an officer serving as the chief of the air force sexual assault prevention & response branch at the pentagon ; and sexual assaults by instructors on recruits and tech school trainees at lackland air force base .
widely publicized allegations of sexual assault in the military have led to questions on how the military pursues claims of sexual misconduct .
under this authority , congress has enacted the uniform code of military justice ( ucmj ) , which is the code of military criminal laws applicable to all u.s. military members worldwide .
for example , the house version includes at least 20 provisions requiring statutory changes to the ucmj , modification of the rules for courts - martial , and other policy changes ; while the senate version , as reported by the senate armed services committee , incorporates at least 26 changes .
congress , exercising its constitutional authority to raise , support , and regulate the armed forces , has attempted to address the issue of sexual assaults and other sex - related offenses under the ucmj through the introduction of various legislative proposals .
the constitution , in order to provide for the common defense , gives congress the power to raise , support , and regulate the armed forces , but makes the president commander in chief of the armed forces .
under article i , section 8 of the u.s. constitution , congress has the power to raise and support armies ; provide and maintain a navy ; and provide for organizing and disciplining them .
the mcm contains the rules for courts - martial ( rcm ) , the military rules of evidence ( mre ) , and the ucmj .
the proposed language , if enacted , would prohibit the enlistment of individuals previously convicted of sexual offenses , eliminate the statute of limitations on prosecution of sexual offenses , and prohibit commanders from overturning a court - martial conviction as part of the post - trial review process .
the house and senate have included numerous provisions addressing sexual assault , including those mentioned above , in the respective versions of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 ( fy2014 ndaa ) .
the president implemented the ucmj through the manual for courts - martial ( mcm ) , which was initially prescribed by executive order 12473 ( april 13 , 1984 ) .
s. 967 addresses sex - related offenses under the ucmj by modifying the authority to proceed to trial by court - martial , modifying the manual for courts - martial to eliminate the factor relating to character and military service of the accused on initial disposition , modifying the authority to convene general and special courts - martial , creating a deadline for a military judge to call general and special courts - martial into session , modifying clemency authority of the convening authority , and requiring command action on reports of sexual offenses .
