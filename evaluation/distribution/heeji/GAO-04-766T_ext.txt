as we reported in 2001 , the particular technology used to cast and count votes is a critical part of this process , but it is only one facet of a multifaceted election process . as requested , my testimony today will focus on electronic voting systems , and in doing so i will address ( 1 ) the role of these systems within the larger election process , ( 2 ) attributes that can be used to examine these systems' capabilities , ( 3 ) the importance of both system design and implementation to the performance of these systems , and ( 4 ) the challenges confronting local jurisdictions in using any type of voting equipment , particularly electronic voting systems . since the act's passage , a number of voting jurisdictions have replaced their older voting equipment with direct recording electronic systems . in january 2004 , the eac began operations . in particular , the act established a program to provide funds to states to replace punch card and lever machine voting equipment , established the eac to assist in the administration of federal elections and provide assistance with the administration of certain federal election laws and programs , and established minimum election administration standards for the states and units of local government that are responsible for the administration of federal elections . other examples of eac responsibilities include ● developing and adopting voluntary voting system guidelines , and maintaining information on the experiences of states in implementing the guidelines and operating voting systems ; ● testing , certifying , decertifying , and recertifying voting system hardware and software through accredited laboratories ; ● making payments to states to help them improve elections in the areas of voting systems standards , provisional voting and voting information requirements , and computerized statewide voter registration lists ; and ● making grants for research on voting technology improvements . optical scan voting systems use electronic technology to tabulate paper ballots . both types allow voters to write in candidates . ● visual enhancements . ● accommodations for voters with disabilities . as older voting equipment has been replaced with newer electronic voting systems over the last 2 years , the debate has shifted from hanging chads and butterfly ballots to vulnerabilities associated with dres . problems with these devices in recent elections have arisen in various states . ensuring the security of elections is essential to public confidence and election integrity , but officials choosing a voting system must also consider other performance factors , such as accuracy , ease of use , and efficiency , as well as cost . ● audit trails . avoiding or compensating for these errors may involve solutions based on technology , processes , or both . as described earlier , dres offer more options for voters with disabilities , as they can be equipped with a number of aids to voters with disabilities . the performance of any information technology system , including electronic voting systems , is heavily influenced by a number of factors , not the least of which is the quality of the system's design and the effectiveness with which the system is implemented in an operational setting . system design and implementation , in turn , are a function of such things as how well the system's requirements are defined , how well the system is tested , and how well the people that operate and use the system understand and follow the procedures that govern their interaction with it . it may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao .
