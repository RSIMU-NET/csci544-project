in recent years , facing the continuing deterioration of its financial condition and its attempt to eliminate its need for federal operating assistance by december 2002 , amtrak undertook a number of actions intended to improve its financial condition . in december 1999 , amtrak's board of directors shifted its route and service strategy toward planning to implement new routes and expand services ( called the network growth strategy ) on the freight railroad tracks over which amtrak operates . amtrak implemented three route actions , although it cancelled one of these in september 2001 . amtrak told us that it cancelled six of the network growth strategy routes before they were implemented , in part , because it overestimated expected increases to mail and express revenue under the network growth strategy . amtrak said that there were several reasons why this overestimation occurred . finally , amtrak officials told us that express shippers were reluctant to enter into contracts for service that did not yet exist . however , all expressed concern about amtrak's becoming a competitor for their freight business . amtrak's network growth strategy has been unsuccessful because it overestimated ( 1 ) revenues expected from new mail and express service and ( 2 ) its ability to reach agreement with freight railroads over capital funding and other implementation issues . amtrak also estimates potential mail and express revenues associated with proposed route actions . amtrak interpreted our conclusion on the need for early consultation with freight railroads before it announced its network growth strategy to mean that we were advocating that it should have “engaged in lengthy ‘consultations' with each of the affected 16 freight railroads” and conducted “expensive and time consuming studies of the physical characteristics of each line , and of the number , type , and schedules of the trains that operate over it.” we did not intend such an interpretation .
