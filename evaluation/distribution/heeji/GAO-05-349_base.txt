b . predatory lender used — car dealers ( n = 11 ) example: most of the participants stated that the car dealerships around base were the worst predatory lenders because they charge high interest rates and often provide cars that are “lemons.” they said that most of the sales people at the dealerships are former personnel who know how to talk to servicemembers to obtain their trust . servicemembers do not expect this . example: one captain had a marine in his unit who signed a contract with a car dealer for a loan with a 26 percent interest rate . what kinds of experiences have your fellow servicemembers or subordinates had with predatory lenders ? other issue regarding experiences with predatory lenders ( n = 13 ) example: businesses will tell young marines that they can buy an item for a certain amount each month . they keep the marine focused on the low monthly payments and not on the interest rate or the terms of the loan . example: some marines feel that a business would not take advantage of them because they are in the military . this leads them to be more trusting of the local businesses than they should be , which in turn , leads the businesses to take advantage of them . the captain took the marine to the marine credit union and got him a new loan with 9.5 percent interest . c. predatory lender used — payday lenders ( n = 10 ) example: a master sergeant got caught in the check - cashing cycle . he would write a check at one payday lender in order to cover a check written at another lender the previous week . example: one participant shared that when he was a younger marine he got caught up with a payday lender . the problem did not resolve itself until he deployed and was not able to go to the lender anymore . d. reason for using predatory lender — get fast cash and no hassle ( n = 10 ) example: people use payday lenders because they are quick and easy . all soldiers have to do is to provide their leave and earnings statement and they get the money . example: most of the participants say they know people that have used a payday lender and those soldiers use them because they have bad credit and can get quick cash . e. predatory lender targeting — close proximity and clustering around bases ( n = 9 ) example: it is almost impossible to be unaware of lenders and dealerships because many are clustered in close proximity to the installation . they also distribute flyers and use pervasive advertising in local and installation papers . example: the stores and car lots near the installation have signs that say “e1 and up approved” or “all military approved” to get the attention of the military servicemembers . f. command role when contacted by creditors ( n = 8 ) example: the noncommissioned officers sometimes offer to go with the junior enlisted to places like car dealers ; but , the young soldiers do not take them up on these offers . example: one participant said that debt collectors do call his house and the command .
