about 13 percent of our nation's electricity is produced by 65 nuclear power reactors that rely on enriched lithium hydroxide — a chemical that is produced and exported only by china and russia . without the lithium hydroxide , the cooling water's acidity would increase the rate of corrosion of pipes and other infrastructure in the reactor — possibly causing them to fail . according to industry representatives , utilities that operate pressurized water reactors have experienced little to no problems obtaining lithium - 7 when they have needed it . this report examines ( 1 ) what is known about the supply and domestic demand for lithium - 7 ; ( 2 ) the responsibilities of doe , nrc , and other entities in assessing risks to the lithium - 7 supply , and what , if anything , has been done to mitigate a potential supply disruption of lithium - 7 ; and ( 3 ) additional options , if any , identified by government officials and industry representatives for mitigating a potential lithium - 7 shortage . in september 2013 , we reported to you on the results of our work in a classified report ; this is an unclassified version of that report . in addition , we compared actions doe is taking to manage and communicate lithium - 7 supply risks with federal standards for internal control . according to industry representatives , lithium - 7 brokers , and nnsa documents , china and russia have produced enough lithium - 7 to meet the current u.s. demand , which is not expected to increase a significant amount in the near future , based on doe's information that shows five new pressurized water reactors scheduled to begin operating by 2018 . china is pursuing the development of two different types of molten salt reactors , according to the expert , each of which will result in a reactor that requires 1,000s of kilograms of lithium - 7 to operate , rather than the approximate 300 kilograms ( about 660 pounds ) annually needed for all 65 u.s. pressurized water reactors combined , according to lithium - 7 brokers . however , doe has taken some steps in this area . specifically , doe studied lithium - 7 supply and demand and concluded that no further action is needed , but our review found shortcomings in doe's study . no federal entity has taken stewardship responsibility for assessing and managing risks to the supply of lithium - 7 for commercial use . in its discussions with industry representatives , representatives identified the following four actions that the nuclear power industry could take should a shortage of lithium - 7 occur: recycling lithium - 7 from the demineralizers ; increasing the burnable poisons in the reactor fuel ; reducing the acidity of the cooling water to reduce the amount of lithium - 7 needed by using boric acid that is enriched with boron - 10 , which would reduce the amount of boric acid added to the cooling water , thus reducing the acidity ; and developing alternative sources of lithium - 7 , including building a domestic lithium - 7 production capability . first , the study states that the isotope program will work with nnsa to prevent its inventory of contaminated lithium - 7 at y - 12 from being disposed of or distributed without approval from doe and will request that nnsa retain 200 kilograms ( 441 pounds ) of this inventory to be purified and then sold to the nuclear power industry in the event of a supply disruption.according to isotope program officials , as part of its mission to support isotope production research and development , the program is also funding research on enriching lithium - 7 without employing the mercury - intensive colex method that was previously used . while studying lithium - 7 supply and demand , doe's isotope program and y - 12 both estimated annual domestic demand for lithium - 7 to be about 200 kilograms per year , whereas the lithium - 7 brokers estimated domestic demand to be over 300 kilograms ( 662 pounds ) per year , on average , from 2008 through 2012 . the third option — reducing pressurized water reactors' reliance on lithium - 7 – is also a longer - term option that would generally require changes in how reactors are operated and may produce only modest reductions in the use of lithium - 7 . to ensure a stable future supply of lithium - 7 , we recommend that the secretary of energy direct the isotope program , consistent with the program's mission to manage isotopes in short supply , to take on the stewardship role by fully assessing supply risks ; communicating risks , as needed , to stakeholders ; ensuring risks are appropriately managed ; and fully and accurately determining domestic demand .
