hurricane katrina was one of the largest natural disasters in u.s. history . despite a large deployment of resources at all levels , many have regarded the federal response as inadequate . gao has a body of ongoing work that covers the federal government 's preparedness and response to hurricanes katrina and rita . due to widespread congressional interest , this review was performed under the comptroller general 's authority . it examined the extent to which pre - katrina plans and training exercises reflected the military assistance that might be required during a catastrophic , domestic , natural disaster , the military support provided in response to katrina and factors that affected that response , and the actions the military is taking to address lessons learned from katrina and to prepare for the next catastrophe . the military mounted a massive response to hurricane katrina that saved many lives and greatly assisted recovery efforts but many lessons are emerging . prior to hurricane katrina , disaster plans and exercises did not incorporate lessons learned from past catastrophes to fully delineate the military capabilities needed to respond to a catastrophe . for example , the government 's national response plan made little distinction between the military response to a smaller regional disaster and its response to a catastrophic natural disaster . in addition , dod 's emergency response plan for providing military assistance to civil authorities during disasters lacked adequate detail . the plan did not : account for the full range of assistance that might be provided by dod , divide tasks between the national guard and the federal responders , or establish response time frames . national guard state plans were also inadequate and did not account for the level of outside assistance that would be needed during a catastrophe , and they were not synchronized with federal plans . moreover , plans had not been tested with a robust exercise program . none of the exercises that were conducted prior to katrina called for a major deployment of dod capabilities in response to a catastrophic hurricane . as a result , a lack of understanding exists within the military and among federal , state , and local responders as to the types of assistance and capabilities that dod might provide in the event of a catastrophe , the timing of this assistance , and the respective contributions of the active - duty and national guard forces . despite the lack of planning , the military took proactive steps and responded with about 50,000 national guard and 20,000 active federal personnel . based on its june 2005 civil support strategy , dod relied heavily on the guard during the initial response . active duty forces were alerted prior to landfall and key capabilities such as aviation , medical , and engineering forces were initially deployed . growing concerns about the magnitude of the disaster prompted dod to deploy large , active ground units to supplement the guard beginning about 5 days after landfall . several factors affected the military 's ability to gain situational awareness and organize and execute its response , including a lack of timely damage assessments , communications difficulties , force integration problems , uncoordinated search and rescue efforts , and unexpected logistics responsibilities . without detailed plans to address these factors , dod and the federal government risk being unprepared for the next catastrophe . dod is examining the lessons learned from its own reviews and those of the white house and the congress , and it is beginning to take actions to address the lessons and prepare for the next catastrophe . it is too early to evaluate dod 's actions , but many appear to hold promise . however , some issues identified after katrina such as damage assessments are long - standing problems that were identified by gao after hurricane andrew in 1992. they will be difficult to address because they are complex and cut across agency boundaries . thus , substantial improvement will require sustained attention from the highest management levels in dod , and across the government .
