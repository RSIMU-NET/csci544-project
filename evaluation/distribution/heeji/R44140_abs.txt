executive permission in the form of a presidential permit has long been required for the construction , connection , operation , and maintenance of certain facilities that cross the united states borders with canada and mexico . the constitutional basis for the president 's cross - border permitting authority has been addressed by the courts , but questions remain about the manner in which this authority is exercised among the agencies to which it has been delegated . in particular , some members of congress and affected stakeholders seek greater clarity about how presidential permit applications are reviewed for various kinds of cross - border energy projects . agency authorities and decisionmaking congress has shown particular interest in the presidential permit review processes for cross - border energy infrastructure as implemented by the department of state for pipelines that transport petroleum , petroleum products , and other hazardous liquids ; the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) for natural gas pipelines ; and the department of energy ( doe ) for electricity transmission lines . the state department makes its permitting decisions primarily in accordance with directives in executive order 11423 ( e.o . ) , as amended by e.o . 13337. ferc and doe make permitting decisions in accordance with e.o . 10485 , as amended by e.o . 12038. broadly speaking , each executive order requires the respective agency to gather necessary project - specific information from the applicant ; seek input from specific outside federal agencies ; and decide whether to seek input from additional local , state , tribal , or federal agencies or from members of the public . under the applicable executive order , each agency is required to issue a presidential permit if , after evaluating all relevant project information , the agency determines that the project would `` serve the national interest '' ( pursuant to e.o . 13337 ) or be `` consistent with the public interest '' ( pursuant to e.o . 10485 ) . for the most part , agencies gather , evaluate , and consider project - related information within the framework of conducting an environmental review . such reviews are generally conducted in accordance with each agency 's process for complying with the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) . in documenting compliance with nepa , each agency evaluates the direct and indirect effects , including any cumulative impacts , of issuing the permit . to do so , each agency generally looks at the effect of constructing the entire project , not just the portions that would cross the border ( i.e . , the action for which the presidential permit is required ) . historically , evaluating impacts of the entire project would not necessarily involve a complex or particularly time - consuming review . with few exceptions , past applications for presidential permits have been for pipelines or transmission lines that extend a relatively short distance into a u.s. border state . recently , however , several pipeline projects — enbridge energy 's alberta clipper and transcanada 's keystone and keystone xl pipeline — have involved projects that are hundreds of miles long and cross multiple states . it was the larger scope of such projects that , in part , resulted in increased national attention to the most recent proposal , the keystone xl pipeline . in 2015 , the state department under president obama denied transcanada 's application for a presidential permit for the project , finding that it did not serve the national interest . however , a new permit application was approved on march 23 , 2017 , when the state department , under the trump administration , found that the project did serve the national interest . issues for congress from 2011 through 2015 , as the state department considered permit applications for the keystone xl pipeline project , congress proposed a number of bills intended to affect the state department 's decisionmaking process . although a permit has been issued for that project , congress may again consider legislative options to expedite agency decisions on future permit applications . congress may choose to address issues that arose during the keystone xl permitting process . for example , during the review , some stakeholders questioned the scope of the nepa review — some were concerned that it was too broad , others that it was too narrow . some also argued there was uncertainty over criteria the state department used to determine whether the project would serve the national interest . congress could potentially clarify these issues through legislation aimed at defining federal agency roles in authorizing cross - border projects .
