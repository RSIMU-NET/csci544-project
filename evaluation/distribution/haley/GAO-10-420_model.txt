our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the u.s. army corps of engineers' ( corps ) reanalysis addressed the economic analysis limitations we identified in 2002 ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the benefit projections the corps included in its reanalysis of the project , as updated , are consistent with current and anticipated future market and industry conditions ; and ( 3 ) what other key issues , if any , could affect the project , and the extent to which the corps has accounted for these issues and their potential impacts .
you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the corps' reanalysis addressed the economic analysis limitations we identified in 2002 ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the benefit projections the corps included in its reanalysis of the project , as updated , are consistent with current and anticipated future market and industry conditions ; and ( 3 ) what other key issues , if any , could affect the project , and the extent to which the corps has accounted for these issues and their potential impacts .
in 1992 congress authorized the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) to implement the delaware river deepening project .
in particular , the corps has made several decisions — such as soliciting information from the public over the winter holiday , and then , following army direction , not seeking public comment on the draft environmental assessment — that have exacerbated public concerns over environmental issues , and as a result , its communications with the public regarding its actions have not been as open as might have been advisable for such a controversial project .
noneconomic aspects of project implementation can also add to uncertainties about the project .
while some of these changes could be short - term trends , others could have longer - lasting impacts .
these issues ranged from errors in benefit and cost estimation — such as the misapplication of commodity growth rates and the omission of disposal site construction costs — to concerns about the corps' treatment of economic uncertainty , the lack of internal quality control in the corps' report review process , and the corps' analysis of selected environmental topics .
a key area of such uncertainty is the outcome of the legal challenges to the project's environmental approvals and compliance .
such information would help decision makers more fully assess the project's economic justification .
to improve consistency and transparency in how the corps handles public participation in the development of environmental documents that are related to controversial projects and that the corps believes have no applicable nepa requirement , we recommend that the chief of engineers develop guidance on the appropriate timing and approaches for public notice and comment on such documents .
the corps expects this greater depth to facilitate the movement of certain commodities — liquid cargo ( such as crude oil ) , containerized cargo ( such as refrigerated meat ) , and bulk commodities ( such as steel slabs and other construction materials ) — to receiving refineries and other terminals along the river .
because the corps' economic updates have not accounted for the potentially significant impact that some market and industry trends could have on the project's estimated benefits , federal decision makers do not have the most current information about the project , including whether adjustments to the assumptions in the corps' benefit models are necessary .
