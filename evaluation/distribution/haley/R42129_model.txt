in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the perception that the unregulated over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives market contributed to systemic risk , the dodd - frank act ( p.l .
111-203 ) sought to remake the otc market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges .
nevertheless , such firms have continued to be concerned that the act could impose indirect costs on them , or that the rulemaking process by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) could do so .
derivative contracts are an array of financial instruments with one feature in common: their value is linked to , or derives from , changes in some underlying variable , such as the price of a physical commodity , a stock index , or an interest rate .
derivatives contracts — futures contracts , options , and swaps — gain or lose value as the underlying rates or prices change , even though the holder may not actually own the underlying asset .
swaps that are cleared are also subject to trading on an exchange , or an exchange - like "swap execution facility" ( sef ) regulated by either the cftc or the sec , in the case of security - based swaps .
when derivatives are cleared , the size of a cleared position is limited by the firm's ability to post capital to cover its potential losses .
many nonfinancial firms complained during the debate over the dodd - frank act that their use of derivatives posed no systemic threat and thus they should not be subjected to the cost of clearing these otc derivatives .
in the dodd - frank act , some of the crucial reforms included a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by one or more federal agencies .
while the clearing of derivatives helps to address systemic concerns , it also imposes the cost of posting margin on those who trade derivatives .
clearinghouses require traders to put down cash ( called initial margin ) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses , and they require subsequent deposits ( called maintenance margin ) to cover actual losses to the position .
in addition , concern about derivatives has been fueled by sharp rises in commodity prices — particularly oil — in 2008 and early 2011 .
one well - known example of such an uncapitalized exposure includes the case of aig , which sold about $1.8 trillion worth of credit default swaps guaranteeing payment if certain mortgage - backed securities defaulted or experienced other "credit events. .
for example , in 2009 the staff of the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the senate committee on homeland security and government affairs found that excessive speculation has had "undue" influence on wheat price movements and in the natural gas market .
as a result of these concerns , the dodd - frank act in section 723 includes a broad exemption from the clearing requirement for firms that are primarily nonfinancial in nature .
a 2011 report by the minority staff of the house committee on oversight and government reform argued that "addressing excessive speculation offers the single most significant opportunity to reduce the price of gas for american consumers. .
