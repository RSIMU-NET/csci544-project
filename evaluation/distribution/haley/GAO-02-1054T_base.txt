the enterprise architecture council will be responsible for developing these products . as the enterprise architecture management program moves forward , the department must ensure that it continues to sufficiently address and complete all critical process steps outlined in the federal cio guidance within reasonable time frames . with enhanced management capabilities provided by an enterprise architecture framework , va should be able to ( 1 ) better focus on the strategic use of emerging technologies to manage its information , ( 2 ) achieve economies of scale by providing mechanisms for sharing services across the department , and ( 3 ) expedite the integration of legacy , migration and new systems . fas will provide the accounting benefits payments functions and will include an interface with the department of the treasury . vba expects to complete software coding for award and fas by march 2003 . based on its most recent estimates , it expects to begin nationwide deployment of the two systems in april 2004 . once these activities are accomplished , vba plans to begin its conversion to the new system , with a completion date currently set for december 2004 . figure 4 depicts vba's current time line for the full implementation of the system . given its current schedule for implementing the c&p replacement system , vba will have to continue relying on bdn to deliver compensation and pension benefits payments until at least the beginning of 2005 . however , with parts of this system nearing 40 years old , without additional maintenance , bdn's capability to continue accurately processing benefits payments is uncertain . our concerns have been substantiated by the va claims processing task force , which in its october 2001 report warned that the system's operations and support were approaching a critical stage and that its performance could potentially degrade and eventually cease . since march , vba has taken steps to help ensure that bdn can be sustained and remains capable of making prompt , uninterrupted payments to veterans . for example , vba has ( 1 ) completed an upgrade of bdn hardware , ( 2 ) hired 11 new staff members dedicated to bdn operations , and ( 3 ) successfully tested a contingency plan . further , according to vba's deputy cio , the administration has developed an action plan outlining strategies for keeping bdn operational until the replacement system is implemented . nonetheless , the risks associated with continual reliance on bdn remain â€” one of the system's software applications ( database monitor software ) is no longer supported by the vendor , nor is it used by any other customer . finally , mr. chairman , i would like to provide updated information on va's progress , in conjunction with the department of defense ( dod ) and the indian health service ( ihs ) , in achieving the ability to share patient health care data as part of the government computer - based patient record ( gcpr ) initiative . as you know , the gcpr project was developed in 1998 out of va and dod discussions about ways to share data in their health information systems and from efforts to create electronic records for active duty personnel and veterans .
