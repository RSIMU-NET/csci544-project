in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , amid the perception that the unregulated over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives market contributed to systemic risk , the dodd - frank act ( p.l . 111-203 ) sought to remake the otc market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges . reforms included a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a clearinghouse regulated by one or more federal agencies . clearinghouses require traders to put down cash ( called initial margin ) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses , and they require subsequent deposits ( called maintenance margin ) to cover actual losses to the position . the intended effect of margin requirements is to prevent firms from building up uncapitalized exposures so large that default would have systemic consequences . while addressing systemic concerns , the clearing of derivatives also imposes the cost of posting margin on those trading derivatives . many nonfinancial firms argued during the debate over the dodd - frank act that their use of derivatives posed no systemic threat and thus they should not be subjected to the cost of clearing these otc derivatives . this particular debate came to be known as `` the end user debate . . as a result of these concerns , the dodd - frank act included a broad exemption from the clearing requirement for firms that are primarily nonfinancial in nature . nevertheless , such firms have continued to be concerned that dodd - frank could impose indirect costs on them , or that the rulemaking process by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and the securities exchange commission ( sec ) could do so . as such , some legislation in the 112th congress , such as h.r . 1610 , s. 947 , s.amdt . 814 to h.r . 2112 , s. 1650 , h.r . 2779 , and h.r . 2682 , addresses potential indirect costs to `` end users . . in addition , concern about derivatives has been fueled by sharp rises in commodity prices — particularly oil — in 2008 and early 2011. such steep jumps , along with high price volatility in a range of commodities , have fostered apprehension that financial speculation in derivatives might be creating such volatility in commodity prices . for instance , during the course of 2008 , oil prices doubled to more than $ 145 per barrel and then fell by 80 % before rebounding , while there was little evidence suggesting disruption of physical supplies . in early 2011 , there was again a run - up of about 20 % , sending gasoline prices to near 2008 highs . such severe fluctuations tend to anger consumers , and thus can become an issue for congress . in the 112th congress , a number of bills , such as h.r . 2328 , s. 1200 , h.r . 3006 , s. 1598 , h.r . 2003 , h.r . 3313 , and s. 1787 seek to address the impact financial speculation and derivatives may have on spot commodity prices . other bills introduced in the 112th congress aim to either tighten or loosen other aspects of derivatives regulation , in the wake of the dodd - frank act , such as h.r . 2586 , h.r . 3045 , h.r . 3283 , and h.r . 1573. this report focuses primarily on legislation introduced in the 112th congress . additional background on how derivatives work , their role in the financial crisis , and the impact of the dodd - frank act on their regulation can be found in another crs report cited below . this report will be updated as events warrant .
