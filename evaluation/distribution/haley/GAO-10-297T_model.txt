the smithsonian has been referred to as america's museum , as its museums hold and provide access to irreplaceable national collections in american and natural history , art , and other areas .
the smithsonian has implemented one of the four recommendations we made in 2008 to strengthen its governance reform efforts , and it has taken steps to implement the other three recommendations .
in my statement today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the findings of a report we are releasing today — smithsonian institution: implementation of governance reforms is progressing , but work remains — regarding the smithsonian's efforts to implement governance reforms recommended by the board of regents governance committee and by gao in 2008 , and ( 2 ) provide a brief update on the smithsonian's efforts to implement our 2007 facilities and funding recommendations .
the board of regents adopted all 25 of the governance committee's recommendations and stated that the irc's recommendations were , for the most part , encompassed by the governance committee's recommendations .
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on efforts by the smithsonian institution ( smithsonian ) to address challenges related to governance and facilities .
while the board of regents has approved policies or plans related to the 2 policy - related reforms , the smithsonian has not completed its implementation of these reforms .
as shown in figure 1 , the smithsonian has implemented 9 governance committee reforms since may 2008 , including the following: the smithsonian ( 1 ) developed a database to identify potential conflicts of interest ; ( 2 ) implemented a policy requiring the former smithsonian business ventures ( sbv ) — now reorganized and renamed smithsonian enterprises — to follow smithsonian policies except in the case of a few documented exceptions ; ( 3 ) developed an event expense policy covering regent and other smithsonian events ; ( 4 ) completed a review of the smithsonian's internal controls for travel and expense reimbursement and implemented a number of additional accountability measures for travel and expense reimbursement ; ( 5 ) held two regent annual public forums ; ( 6 ) developed a board orientation process ; ( 7 ) completed a review and revision of the board of regents committees' charters ; ( 8 ) completed a review of appointment procedures to board of regents committees , which included clarifying the process for appointing nonregents to committees and making this process publicly available on the smithsonian's web site ; and ( 9 ) implemented a reform calling for a regular assessment of the board , its committees , and its members .
the smithsonian has not completed implementation of 3 reforms — 2 related to improving policies on broader smithsonian operations ( to develop a contracting policy and conduct a comprehensive review of financial reporting and internal controls ) and one related to communication and stakeholder relationships ( to enhance the role of the smithsonian advisory boards ) .
in september 2007 , we concluded that if the smithsonian did not develop a viable strategy to address its estimated $2.5 billion in facilities projects , its facilities and collections would face increased risk , and the ability of the smithsonian to meet its mission would likely decline .
