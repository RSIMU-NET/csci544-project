in fiscal year 1997 , the department of the interior's minerals management service ( mms ) collected about $4.1 billion in royalties from approximately 22,000 oil and gas leases on federal lands .
interested in the increased revenues that would result from the proposed regulations , as well as the oil industry's opposition to them , you asked us to address the following: ( 1 ) the information used by mms to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations ; ( 2 ) how mms has addressed concerns expressed by the oil industry and states in developing these regulations ; and ( 3 ) the feasibility of the federal government's taking its oil and gas royalties in kind , as indicated by existing studies and programs .
by law , the states in which these leases are located receive a share of the royalties collected , which are calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil or gas that is produced .
legislation mandating that mms accept federal oil and gas royalties in kind has been introduced in both the u.s. senate and the house of representatives .
the value of much of the oil from federal leases has been based on posted prices â€” offers by purchasers to buy oil from a specific area .
on the basis of this evidence , in 1995 mms began revising its regulations for valuing oil from federal leases and in february 1998 issued its most recent revision .
however , recent evidence indicates that oil is now often sold for more than the posted prices , suggesting that the value of the oil from federal leases and the amount of federal royalties should both be higher .
as an alternative , the oil industry has suggested that mms instead be required to accept , as the federal government's royalties , a percentage of the actual oil and gas produced from federal leases ( known as royalties in kind ) , rather than cash royalties based on the value of that oil and gas .
by requiring that higher prices be used to value much of the oil from federal leases , the proposed regulations would increase federal royalties by as much as $66 million annually , according to mms .
the proposed regulations would reduce the use of posted prices to value much of the oil from federal leases and would instead generally require that other , and oftentimes higher , prices be used .
mms would then sell this oil and gas to generate revenues .
although states that receive distributions of these royalties generally support the proposed regulations , oil industry representatives generally oppose them , believing that oil companies should not pay royalties on higher prices and that they would suffer increased administrative requirements .
to determine federal royalties , the proposed regulations define the price of oil not sold in arm's - length transactions differently in each of three domestic oil markets: ( 1 ) alaska and california ( including leases off the shore of california ) ; ( 2 ) the six rocky mountain states of colorado , montana , north dakota , south dakota , utah , and wyoming ; and ( 3 ) the rest of the country , including the gulf of mexico .
