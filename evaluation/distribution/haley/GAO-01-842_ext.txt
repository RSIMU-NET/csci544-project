ins has spent 7 years implementing its southwest border strategy , but it may take ins up to a decade longer to fully implement the strategy . this assumes that ins obtains the level of staff , technology , equipment , and fencing it believes it needs to control the southwest border . although illegal alien apprehensions have shifted , there is no clear indication that overall illegal entry into the united states along the southwest border has declined . ins' current efforts to measure the effectiveness of its border control efforts could be enhanced by analyzing data in its ident system . these data offer ins an opportunity to develop additional performance indicators that could be incorporated into its annual performance plan review process and could help ins assess whether its border control efforts are associated with an overall reduction in the flow of illegal aliens across the border . borderwide analysis of the ident data could be used to address several important questions related to illegal entry . the strategy's impact on local communities has been affected by the timing of ins' infusion of agent and other resources intended to protect the local community from a surge in illegal alien traffic ; what routes the illegal aliens have used in crossing the border ; and ins' involvement with the community . ins has learned the importance of outreach efforts in attempting to mitigate the potential negative effects the strategy can cause a community and the harm that can befall illegal aliens who risk injury and death to cross the border . however , he also stated that “ins will continue to evaluate the use of ident data for analyzing shifts in illegal alien traffic,” and a “congressional moratorium on the deployment of new ident sites , as well as efforts to integrate ident [with the automated fingerprint system used by the federal bureau of investigation] , have an operational impact that delays comprehensive data collection along the southwest border.” we believe that ident , which has been incrementally deployed to all border patrol stations along the southwest border since 1995 , already contains data that could be used to determine the number of aliens border patrol agents have arrested between ports of entry , how many times they have been arrested trying to enter illegally , and what shifts in illegal entry attempts between ports of entry have occurred over time along the southwest border .
