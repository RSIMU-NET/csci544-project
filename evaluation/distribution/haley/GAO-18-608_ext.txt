this report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued in june 2018 . consequently , this version only includes information on objectives ( 1 ) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated niv applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , and ( 2 ) key changes to the niv screening and vetting process in response to executive actions taken in calendar year 2017 and related guidance . the data fields we analyzed included month and year of adjudication ; type of niv ; location of application ; applicant nationality ; outcome of application ( e.g. , issuance and refusal ) ; and , if applicable , reason for refusal . in fiscal year 2017 , niv adjudications decreased by about 880,000 adjudications , or about 7 percent . during the same time period , adjudications for tourist and business visitors also increased by approximately 20 percent overall ( from 8.18 million to 9.97 million ) , but decreased from fiscal years 2016 to 2017 . similar to tourist and business visitors , state officials partly attributed the overall changes in student and exchange visitor visa adjudications to the extension of the validity period of such visas for chinese nationals , which represented the largest single country of nationality for student and exchange visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 ( 19 percent ) . in fiscal year 2017 , more than half of all niv adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: china ( 2.02 million , or 16 percent ) , mexico ( 1.75 million , or 14 percent ) , india ( 1.28 million , or 10 percent ) , brazil ( 670,000 , or 5 percent ) , colombia ( 460,000 , or 4 percent ) , and argentina ( 370,000 , or 3 percent ) , as shown in figure 6 . state data indicate the more than 90 percent of nivs refused each year from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 were based on the consular officers' determination that the applicants were ineligible nonimmigrants — in other words , the consular officers believed that the applicant was an intending immigrant seeking to stay permanently in the united states , which would generally violate niv conditions , or that the applicant otherwise failed to demonstrate eligibility for the particular visa he or she was seeking . our analysis of state data indicates that relatively few applicants — approximately 0.05 percent — were refused for terrorism and other security - related reasons from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 . in calendar year 2017 , the president issued two executive orders and a presidential proclamation that required , among other actions , visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain countries of concern , a review of information needed for visa adjudication , and changes to visa ( including niv ) screening and vetting protocols and procedures ( see timeline in figure 11 ) . it further directed federal agencies — including dhs , state , doj and odni — to review information needs from foreign governments for visa adjudication and develop uniform screening and vetting standards for u.s. entities to follow when adjudicating immigration benefits , including nivs . challenges to both eos and the proclamation have affected their implementation and , while eo - 2's entry restrictions have expired , the visa entry restrictions outlined in the proclamation continue to be fully implemented as of june 2018 , consistent with the u.s. supreme court's june 26 , 2018 , decision , which held that the president may lawfully establish nationality - based entry restrictions under the ina , and that proclamation 9645 itself “is squarely within the scope of presidential authority.” a more detailed listing of the executive actions and related challenges to those actions brought in the federal courts can be found in appendix iii . for example , state sought and received emergency approval from the office of management and budget in may 2017 to develop a new form , the ds - 5535 . state estimated that , across all posts , the groups requiring additional vetting represented about 70,500 individuals per year . in this section , we provide the number of annual niv adjudications for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , the specific nivs adjudicated in fiscal year 2017 within the group , the regions to which applicants applied for these nivs in fiscal year 2017 , and the top five nationalities that applied for nivs in the group in fiscal year 2017 . ● in fiscal year 2017 , temporary worker visas were most frequently refused because the applicant did not provide adequate documentation to the consular officer . in particular , it describes relevant aspects of the executive actions specifically addressed in this report — executive orders 13769 and 13780 , both titled protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states , and presidential proclamation 9645 , enhancing vetting capabilities and processes for detecting attempted entry into the united states by terrorists or other public - safety threats — that imposed visa entry restrictions on certain countries' nationals and included provisions addressing niv screening and vetting , as well as other executive actions on immigration issued by the current administration .
