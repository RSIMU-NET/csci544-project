( see fig . assessment — actions in the event of persistent neglect of duties: the smithsonian implemented gao's recommendation to evaluate what actions it can take in the event of persistent neglect of duties by a regent . in july 2009 , the board of regents governance and nominating committee implemented this recommendation by considering a staff paper that described actions that could be taken in the event of persistent neglect of duties , and approving an approach that included initial counseling and potential referral to the full board of regents for appropriate action . structure and composition: the board of regents has not fully implemented gao's recommendation to develop and make public its process for the selection , use , and evaluation of nonregents . the board of regents implemented part of the recommendation by posting on its web site the process for selecting nonregent committee members . however , the board of regents did not make a final decision regarding the use of nonregents on committees when in july 2009 , its governance and nominating committee tabled a proposed bylaw to give nonregent members of committees the same roles and responsibilities as regents . both the smithsonian and the board of regents concurred with the findings of that report . information regarding the smithsonian's efforts to implement our 2007 facilities and funding recommendations is based on our september 2007 report on the smithsonian's facilities and our review of updated information provided in smithsonian documents — including office of protection services documents , the smithsonian's draft facilities capital program ( fiscal years 2010-2014 ) , and minutes from the board of regents' november 2007 meeting — and through interviews with smithsonian officials . we conducted our work for this report in november and december 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . communication and stakeholder relationships: the board of regents took steps to improve its relationship with stakeholders , including advisory boards . for example , the chair of the board of regents now sends a quarterly email to all advisory board chairs providing information on the most recent board of regents' meeting and asking to be contacted directly with any concerns . according to a smithsonian official , when a concern is brought to the chair's attention , it is either responded to immediately or tracked by the office of the board of regents until responded to . in addition , the smithsonian conducted a workshop of advisory board chairs in april 2009 as part of its strategic planning process , which was organized through the regents and led by the chair of the board of regents and the secretary of the smithsonian . according to a smithsonian official , the input provided by these advisory board chairs was considered as the strategic plan was developed . however , due to limitations of the efforts thus far — such as their informal nature and focus on dissemination of information from the regents rather than two - way communication — several advisory board chairs with whom we spoke expressed concern that the board of regents still lacked a sufficient understanding of smithsonian museums and other entities to govern as effectively as possible .
