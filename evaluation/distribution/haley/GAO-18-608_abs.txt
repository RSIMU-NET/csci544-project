previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the united states have raised questions about the security of the u.s. government 's process for adjudicating nivs , which are issued to foreign nationals , such as tourists , business visitors , and students , seeking temporary admission into the united states . for example , the december 2015 shootings in san bernardino , california , led to concerns about niv screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the united states under a niv . in 2017 , the president issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting , and establishing nationality - based visa entry restrictions , which the supreme court upheld in june 2018. gao was asked to review niv screening and vetting . this report examines outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated niv applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , and key changes made to the niv adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. gao analyzed state niv adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , the most recent and complete data available . gao visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors . gao reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations , and documents related to implementing these actions . this is a public version of a sensitive report issued in june 2018. information that dhs , state , and the office of the director of national intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed . the total number of nonimmigrant visa ( niv ) applications that department of state ( state ) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016 , and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. niv adjudications varied by visa group , country of nationality , and refusal reason : visa group . from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , about 80 percent of niv adjudications were for tourists and business visitors . during this time , adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent . country of nationality . in fiscal year 2017 , more than half of all niv adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality : china ( 2.02 million , or 16 percent ) , mexico ( 1.75 million , or 14 percent ) , india ( 1.28 million , or 10 percent ) , brazil ( 670,000 , or 5 percent ) , colombia ( 460,000 , or 4 percent ) , and argentina ( 370,000 , or 3 percent ) . refusal reason . state data indicate that over this time period , 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused ; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought , and a small percentage ( 0.05 percent ) were due to terrorism and security - related concerns . in 2017 , two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the president required , among other actions , visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern , the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards , and changes to niv screening and vetting procedures . gao 's analysis of state data indicates that , out of the nearly 2.8 million niv applications refused in fiscal year 2017 , 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions . state , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the u.s. government for all immigration benefits , such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks . further , state sought and received emergency approval from the office of management and budget in may 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants , such as email addresses and social media handles .
