as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , our objectives for this third report are to ( 1 ) evaluate the departments' progress and plans toward developing electronic health record systems or capabilities that allow for full interoperability and comply with applicable federal interoperability standards and ( 2 ) determine whether the interagency program office established by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 is positioned to function as a single point of accountability for developing and implementing electronic health records . to accomplish these objectives , we reviewed our past work in this area ; analyzed current agency documentation ( including plans outlining objectives for achieving interoperability , project status information , and the interagency program office charter ) ; and conducted interviews with officials from dod and va. we conducted this performance audit from april 2009 through july 2009 , in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . in this regard , the departments have achieved planned capabilities for three of the interoperability objectives â€” refine social history data , share physical exam data , and demonstrate initial network gateway operation . for the remaining three objectives , the departments have partially achieved planned capabilities , with additional work needed to fully meet the objectives . regarding the objective to expand questionnaires and self - assessment tools , this additional work is intended to be completed by september 2009 . with respect to the objectives to expand essentris and demonstrate initial document scanning , department officials stated that they also intend to meet these objectives ; however , additional work will be required beyond september to perform all the activities necessary to meet clinicians' needs for health information . the acting director stated that the departments expect to meet their goal of sharing 63 percent of inpatient discharge summaries and expand the system to an air force and a navy site by the september deadline . the dod / va interagency program office is not yet effectively positioned to serve as a single point of accountability for the implementation of fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities . since we last reported in january 2009 , the departments have made progress in setting up the office by hiring additional staff , although they continue to fill key leadership positions on an interim basis . in addition , the office has begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter , but is not yet fulfilling key it management responsibilities in the areas of performance measurement , scheduling , and project planning . in particular , the departments have taken steps to meet their six interoperability objectives by september 30 , 2009 . to better improve management of dod's and va's efforts to achieve fully interoperable electronic health record systems , including satisfaction of the departments' interoperability objectives , we recommend that the secretaries of defense and veterans affairs direct the director of the dod / va interagency program office to establish a project plan and a complete and detailed integrated master schedule .
