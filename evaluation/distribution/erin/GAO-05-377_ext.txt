however , some operators did not reclaim blm land disturbed by hardrock operations related to exploration , mining , and mineral processing when their operations ceased . these operators left blm with many thousands of acres of disturbed land , some of which posed environmental and health and safety risks . the 2001 regulations specify the following types of financial assurances as acceptable: surety bonds that meet the requirements of u.s. treasury circular 570 ; cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a federal depository account of the u.s. treasury by blm ; irrevocable letters of credit from a bank or other financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in the united states ; certificates of deposit or savings accounts not in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation's maximum insurable amount ; negotiable u.s. , state , and municipal securities or bonds with a market value of at least the required dollar amount of the financial assurance maintained in a securities investors protection corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of the secretary of the interior ; investment - grade securities that ( 1 ) have a standard and poor's rating of aaa or aa , or an equivalent rating from another nationally recognized securities rating service , ( 2 ) have a market value of at least the required dollar amount of the financial assurance , and ( 3 ) are maintained in a securities investors protection corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of the secretary of the interior ; certain types of insurance underwritten by a company having an a.m. best rating of “superior” or an equivalent rating from another nationally recognized insurance rating service ; evidence of an existing financial assurance under state law or regulations , as long as the financial assurance is held or approved by the state agency for the same operations covered by the notice or plan of operation , has a value equal to the required amount , and is redeemable by blm . the field offices maintain case files on each hardrock operation in their jurisdiction . blm reported that it had approximately 2,500 existing notice - and plan - level hardrock operations as of july 2004 and that some of these operations do not have financial assurances , and some have no or outdated reclamation plans and / or cost estimates on which financial assurances should be based . blm identified 48 hardrock operations on blm land that had ceased and not been reclaimed by operators since it began requiring financial assurances . blm reported that the most recent cost estimates for reclamation required by applicable plans and federal regulations for 43 of these operations totaled about $136 million , with no adjustment for inflation ; it did not report reclamation cost estimates for the other 5 operations . however , as of july 2004 , financial assurances had provided or were guaranteeing $69 million , and federal agencies and others had provided $10.6 million to pay estimated reclamation costs for the 48 operations , leaving $56.4 million of reclamation costs unfunded . specifically , these financial assurances were not adequate for 25 of the 48 operations because ( 1 ) operators did not provide financial assurances for 10 hardrock operations , ( 2 ) the financial assurances that were provided were less than the most recent cost estimates for 13 operations , and / or ( 3 ) the financial assurance providers declared bankruptcy and did not have the funds to pay all reclamation costs for two other operations . blm's lr2000 is not reliable and sufficient for managing financial assurances to cover reclamation costs for blm land disturbed by hardrock operations because staff do not always update information , and lr2000 is not currently designed to track certain critical information . given these limitations , it is not surprising that blm's reliance on lr2000 to manage financial assurances is mixed . in part to compensate for lr2000 limitations , some blm offices use informal record - keeping systems to help manage financial assurances . blm has taken some steps and identified others to improve lr2000 for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations . at the headquarters level , blm does not always rely on information in lr2000 . specifically , we were asked to determine the ( 1 ) types , amount , and coverage of financial assurances operators currently use to guarantee reclamation costs ; ( 2 ) amount that financial assurance providers and others have paid to reclaim operations that had ceased and not been reclaimed since blm began requiring financial assurances and the estimated costs of completing reclamation for such operations ; and ( 3 ) reliability and sufficiency of blm's automated lr2000 information system for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations . 11 .
