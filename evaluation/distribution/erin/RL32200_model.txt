the consideration of a measure in the committee of the whole and in the house can be divided into five stages: ( 1 ) the house resolves itself into the committee of the whole ; ( 2 ) members engage in general debate on the measure ; ( 3 ) members offer , consider , and vote on amendments to the measure ; ( 4 ) the committee of the whole rises and reports back to the house with a recommendation ; and ( 5 ) the house votes on the recommendation and then on the measure itself .
they can discuss legislation , propose changes to the pending text , and suggest actions that may facilitate deliberation or expedite decision making .
members of the house of representatives have multiple opportunities to participate in the consideration of measures on the floor .
an important parliamentary device designed to allow greater participation in debate is the committee of the whole ( formally , the committee of the whole house on the state of the union ) .
the house considers most major measures in the committee of the whole ; in fact , house rules require revenue , appropriations , and authorization measures to be first considered in the committee of the whole ( house rule xviii , clause 3 ) .
to achieve these legislative objectives , members rely on standard procedures and phraseology that have evolved over the course of congressional history .
the house can agree to resolve itself into the committee of the whole in one of three ways: by a special rule , by unanimous consent , or by motion .
finally , in very limited circumstances a member may make a motion to resolve into the committee of the whole to consider ( or further consider ) a bill , although it is not done in modern practice .
the committee of the whole can be understood as the assembly in a different form ; it is a committee of the house composed of every representative that meets in the house chamber .
typically , the house adopts a special rule , a simple resolution reported by the committee on rules , authorizing the speaker to declare the house resolved into the committee of the whole to consider a particular measure .
various rules and procedures , discussed in this report , govern how and when members can participate in debate , offer amendments , make motions and requests , and take other actions in the committee of the whole .
less frequently , a member might ask unanimous consent that the house resolve itself into the committee of the whole for consideration of a particular measure .
after the house resolves itself into the committee of the whole to consider a particular bill or resolution , members engage in general debate on the measure .
although there is variation in the language used by members to engage in these activities , the report also presents some examples of parliamentary phraseology .
in either case , the house sets the procedural conditions under which the particular measure is considered in the committee of the whole .
measures considered in the committee of the whole typically are subject to conditions governing debate and amendments that are specified by a special rule from the committee on rules or a unanimous consent agreement .
