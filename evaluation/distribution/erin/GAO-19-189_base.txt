conference report no . 112-284 included a provision for gao to assess the jwst program annually and to report to the committees on appropriations on key issues relating to program and risk management , achievement of cost and schedule goals , program technical status , and oversight mechanisms . in june 2018 , after a series of launch delay announcements due to technical and workmanship issues identified during spacecraft element integration , nasa notified congress that it had again revised the jwst program's cost and schedule estimates . nasa estimated that it now required $828 million in additional resources and 29 more months to complete beyond those estimates agreed to in the 2011 rebaseline . as of november 2018 , nasa had funding to continue to execute the program and was waiting to see if congress would authorize the program's continuation and appropriate funds for the program in fiscal year 2019 . figure 2 shows the project's history of changes to its cost or schedule and key findings from two external independent review teams and our prior work . as discussed above , various technical and workmanship errors drove some of the more recent delays . examples of some of the workmanship issues we found in the past include: in october 2015 , the project reported that a piece of flight hardware for the sunshield's mid - boom assembly was irreparably damaged during vacuum sealing in preparation for shipping . the damaged piece had to be remanufactured , which consumed 3 weeks of schedule reserve . in april 2017 , a contractor technician applied too much voltage and irreparably damaged the spacecraft's pressure transducers , components of the propulsion system that help monitor spacecraft fuel levels . the transducers had to be replaced and reattached in a complicated welding process . at the same time , northrop grumman also addressed several challenges with integrating sunshield hardware . these issues combined took up another 1.25 months of schedule reserve . in may 2017 , some of the valves in the spacecraft propulsion system's thruster modules were leaking beyond permissible levels . northrop grumman determined that the most likely cause was the use of an improper cleaning solution , and the thruster modules were returned to the vendor for investigation and refurbishment . reattaching the refurbished modules was expected to be complete by february 2018 , but was delayed by one month when a technician applied too much voltage to one of the components in a recently refurbished thruster module . nasa and northrop grumman reported that resolving the thruster module issue resulted in a 2-month delay to the project's overall schedule . in october 2017 , when conducting folding and deployment exercises on the sunshield , northrop grumman discovered several tears in the sunshield membrane layers . according to program officials , a workmanship error contributed to the tears . the tears resulted in another 2-month delay to the project's overall schedule . in addition , some first - time efforts took longer than planned . for example , in fall 2017 , the project determined that it would need to use up to 3 months of schedule reserve based upon lessons learned from the contractor's initial sunshield folding operation .
