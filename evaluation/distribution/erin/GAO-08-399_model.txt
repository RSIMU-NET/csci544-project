this report discusses the ( 1 ) potential benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures and the extent to which they are documented and measured , ( 2 ) lessons learned from existing and proposed va joint ventures with dod and academic affiliates , and ( 3 ) steps va has taken to evaluate proposed joint ventures .
health care services shared under these agreements include inpatient and outpatient care ; ancillary services , such as diagnostic and therapeutic radiology ; dental care ; pharmacy services ; and specialty care services , such as treatment for spinal cord injuries .
analyze the differences among types of joint venture partners to determine whether the evaluation criteria should be tailored to the type of partner ( e.g. , dod or academic affiliate ) and , if so , tailor the criteria accordingly .
the sharing act has been amended several times since 1982 and is codified at 38 u.s.c .
to develop a more comprehensive framework for evaluating existing and future joint ventures , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs take the following three actions: develop departmental performance measures to assess the outcomes of joint ventures and to determine the extent to which strategic goals are being achieved .
congress has also recently encouraged va to explore opportunities for expanding its collaboration with academic affiliates as a potential cost - effective means of rebuilding and revitalizing va's aging infrastructure .
for example , in 2003 , congress required the secretary of veterans affairs to study the feasibility of coordinating health care services with representatives of va's academic affiliate , the medical university of south carolina ( musc ) in charleston , and , in 2006 , congress authorized va to collaborate with its academic affiliate , louisiana state university ( lsu ) , on rebuilding the two new orleans medical centers destroyed during hurricane katrina .
va and dod have taken steps to mitigate these access issues .
va also has a long history of developing partnerships , or affiliations , with university medical schools to help va fulfill its mission of providing health care to the nation's veterans .
va and dod have also taken steps to improve and expand their health care sharing activities .
va's effort to develop criteria for evaluating joint venture proposals is a positive step in improving va's process for assessing joint venture proposals .
the administration has also encouraged such collaboration between va and dod as a means to achieve more cost - effective use of health care resources .
the 2003 presidential task force to improve health care delivery for our nation's veterans also found that none of va's and dod's performance metrics measured the depth and breadth of va - dod collaboration and sharing , or the impact of successful collaboration on various health care indicators , such as improved access or reductions in the overall cost of furnishing services .
