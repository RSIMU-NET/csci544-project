ii , app . interoperability can be achieved at different levels . at the highest level , electronic data are computable ( that is , in a format that a computer can understand and act on to , for example , provide alerts to clinicians on drug allergies ) . at a lower level , electronic data are structured and viewable , but not computable . the value of data at this level is that they are structured so that data of interest to users are easier to find . at still a lower level , electronic data are unstructured and viewable , but not computable . with unstructured electronic data , a user would have to find needed or relevant information by searching uncategorized data . beyond these , paper records also can be considered interoperable ( at the lowest level ) because they allow data to be shared , read , and interpreted by human beings . according to dod and va officials , not all data require the same level of interoperability , nor is interoperability at the highest level achievable in all cases . those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . we believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives . in addition to the contact named above , key contributions to this report were made by mark bird , assistant director ; rebecca eyler ; lee mccracken ; michael redfern ; j. michael resser ; kelly shaw ; eric trout ; and merry woo . for example , veterans may receive outpatient care from va clinicians and be hospitalized at a military treatment facility . the interface also allows dod sites to see previously inaccessible data at other dod sites . the clinical data repository / health data repository ( chdr ) interface , implemented in september 2006 , linked the departments' separate repositories of standardized data to enable a two - way exchange of computable health information . these repositories are a part of the modernized health information systems that the departments have been developing — dod's ahlta and va's healthevet . in their ongoing initiatives to share information , va uses its integrated medical information system — the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) — which was developed in - house by va clinicians and it personnel . all va medical facilities have access to all vista information . dod currently relies on its ahlta , which is comprised of multiple legacy medical information systems that the department developed from commercial software products that were customized for specific uses . for example , chcs , which was formerly dod's primary health information system , is still in use to capture pharmacy , radiology , and laboratory order management . in addition , the department uses essentris ( also called the clinical information system ) , a commercial health information system customized to support inpatient treatment at military medical facilities . not all of dod's medical facilities yet have this inpatient medical system .
