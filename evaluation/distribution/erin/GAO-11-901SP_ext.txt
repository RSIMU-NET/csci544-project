as you know , millions of americans rely on retirement savings plans for their financial well - being in retirement . specifically , my comments will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which db plans have invested in hedge funds and private equity , ( 2 ) challenges that such plans face in investing in hedge funds and private equity , ( 3 ) steps that plan sponsors can take to address these challenges , and ( 4 ) the implications of these challenges for plan sponsors and the federal government . specifically , this project — being conducted for the ranking member of the subcommittee on health , employment , labor and pensions of the house committee on education and the workforce — seeks to assess the extent to which db plans have realized desired benefits from investing in hedge funds and private equity , and what actions they may have taken in response to lessons learned over the last 5 years . according to a pensions & investments survey , the percentage of large plans ( as measured by total plan assets ) investing in hedge funds grew from 11 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010 ( see fig . over the same time period , the percentage of large plans that invest in private equity grew at a much slower rate — 71 percent to 92 percent — likely because of the fact that a much larger percentage of plans were already invested in private equity in 2001 . similarly , among plans with investments in private equity , the average allocation was a little over 9 percent . available survey data show that larger plans , measured by total plan assets , are more likely to invest in hedge funds and private equity compared with midsize plans . for example , both hedge fund and private equity managers may use leverage — that is , borrowed money or other techniques — to potentially increase an investment's return without increasing the amount of capital invested . leverage can magnify profits , but can also magnify losses to the fund if the market goes against the fund's expectations . hedge funds and private equity are also relatively illiquid investments — that is , investors generally cannot easily redeem their investments on demand . we reported that pension plans investing in hedge funds are also exposed to operational risk — that is , the risk of investment loss because of inadequate or failed internal processes , people , and systems , or problems with external service providers . pension plan officials we spoke with take a number of steps in an attempt to mitigate the risks and challenges of investing in hedge funds and private equity . plan sponsors and others also cited the importance of negotiating key terms of investments in hedge funds and private equity . due diligence and ongoing monitoring , beyond those required for traditional investments , are also important . in addition , investing through a fund of funds may provide a plan better access to hedge funds or private equity funds than a plan would be able to obtain through direct investment . in light of these challenges , and as predecessors to this 2011 erisa advisory council have concluded , the department of labor ( labor ) can play a role in helping to ensure that plans fulfill their employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) fiduciary duties when investing in hedge funds and private equity . the report acknowledged that hedge fund investments are not necessarily suitable for some investors and provided many recommendations for investors selecting and monitoring their hedge fund investments — including best practices for valuation — such as obtaining a written statement of the fund's valuation policies and procedures and ensuring the fund's portfolio is being valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) . finally , we noted that while ebsa is not tasked with offering guidance to public sector plans , such plans may nonetheless benefit from such guidance . although labor generally agreed with our recommendation , the agency explained that the lack of uniformity among these investments could complicate the development of comprehensive guidance for plan fiduciaries .
