the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) of 1996 dramatically changed the nation's cash assistance program for needy families with children . the former program , aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) , was replaced with the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , which provides states with $16.5 billion each year through 2002 to serve this population . as specified in prwora , tanf's goals include ending the dependence of needy families on government benefits by promoting job preparation , work , and marriage ; preventing and reducing the incidence of nonmarital pregnancies ; and encouraging two - parent families . moreover , with the large drop in tanf caseloads nationally , a greater share of federal tanf block grant funds and state funds , known as state “maintenance - of - effort” funds , is now devoted to various support services that are typically contracted out . while prwora expanded the flexibility of states to design and administer their tanf programs , it also limited the ability of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to regulate states' tanf programs . we determined ( 1 ) the extent and nature of state and local government contracting with for - profit and nonprofit organizations , using federal and state tanf funds to provide services to eligible recipients ; ( 2 ) what approaches are used by the federal government to oversee tanf contracting with nongovernmental entities and what problems have been identified in this area nationally ; ( 3 ) what approaches are used by state and local governments to ensure compliance with bid solicitation and contract award requirements and what violations of these requirements have been identified involving the awarding of contracts funded by tanf in selected jurisdictions ; and ( 4 ) what approaches are used by state and local governments to ensure that organizations contracted to provide services funded by tanf comply with the terms of their contracts and what major instances of noncompliance with such requirements have been identified in selected jurisdictions . hhs relies primarily on state single audits to oversee tanf contracting by states and localities . state and local governments rely on third parties to help ensure compliance with procurement requirements , including bid protests , judicial processes , and external audits . audit reports cited uneven oversight coverage of tanf contractors over time or across local contracting agencies . the auditors found instances in which several contractors had billed the contracting agency for duplicate costs . however , hhs officials told us that they do not know the extent and nature of problems pertaining to the oversight of tanf contractors that state single audit reports have cited because hhs does not analyze these reports in such a comprehensive manner . to facilitate improved oversight of tanf contractors by all levels of government , we recommend that the secretary of hhs direct the assistant secretary for children and families to use state single audit reports in a more systematic manner to identify the extent and nature of problems related to state oversight of nongovernmental tanf contractors and determine what additional actions may be appropriate to help prevent and correct such problems .
